           transition report on Form 10-Q, or portion thereof will be filed

[ ]   (c)  The accountant's statement or other exhibit required by Rule 12b-
           25(c) has been attached if applicable.
PART III - NARRATIVE

State below in reasonable detail the reasons why the Form 10-K, 11-K, 10-Q,
N-SAR, or the transition report or portion thereof, could not be filed within
the prescribed time period.

On December 11, 1995, the Registrant announced that it had reached an
agreement in principle on a financial restructuring of the Registrant with
the committees of holders representing all of the Registrant's publicly held
unsecured debt.  The Registrant intended promptly thereafter to file a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") and, upon SEC approval of the registration statement, to begin to
solicit votes for approval of a prepackaged plan of reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code that would accomplish the
restructuring.

On December 18, 1995, the Registrant announced that it had postponed the
filing of its registration statement to permit the Registrant's senior
secured lenders (who were not in agreement with the agreement in principle
reached on December 11) and publicly-held unsecured debt additional time to
negotiate the terms of a restructuring proposal.

The Registrant reasonably believes that such negotiations will either
terminate or result in an agreement between the Registrant's senior secured
lenders and holders of the Registrant's publicly held unsecured debt within
fifteen days.  Accordingly, the Registrant anticipates filing its annual
report on Form 10-K simultaneously with an announcement of the results of
such negotiations.  This timing will permit the Registrant to discuss more
completely the Registrant's liquidity issues in the Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

PART IV - OTHER INFORMATION

(1)  Name and telephone number of person to contact in regard to this
     notification:

                     Name                  Area Code and Phone Number

(2)  Have all other periodic reports required under Section 13 or 15(d) of
     the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 or Section 30 of the Investment
     Company Act of 1940 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter)
     period that the registrant was required to file such reports) been
     filed?  If answer is no, identify report(s).
                                                          [X]  Yes   [ ] No

(3)  Is it anticipated that any significant change in results of operations
     from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year will be
     reflected by the earnings statements to be included in the subject
     report or portion thereof?
                                                          [X]  Yes   [ ] No
<PAGE> 2
     If so, attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both narratively
     and quantitatively, and, if appropriate, state the reasons why a
     reasonable estimate of the results cannot be made.

     The Registrant incurred a loss of $238.3 million for the year ended
     September 30, 1995 as compared to income of $15.0 million and $18.6
     million for the year ended September 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
     Included in the fiscal 1995 loss are special charges of $136.9 million,
     representing a write-off of goodwill of $108.0 million and $28.9 million
     of costs associated with software investments.  Also included in the
     loss is a $29.0 million deferred tax provision and $32.7 million of
     restructuring charges which include severance costs, inventory write-
     downs, excess facilities and other reserves.  Further contributing to
     the overall loss was a decrease in operating income of $38.2 million
     compared to the prior year and $6.0 million of expenses associated with
     the proposed refinancing and current restructuring.
