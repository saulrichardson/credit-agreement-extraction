<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">JACKSONVILLE, Fla., January&nbsp;2, 2024 - Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. (NYSE: RYAM) (the &#147;Company&#148;), the global leader in High Purity

of its 2024 fiscal year. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The amendment amends that certain Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of July&nbsp;20, 2023 (the &#147;Term Loan Credit
Agreement&#148;), to, among other things, increase the maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio, as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement, that RYAM must maintain through its 2024 fiscal year. Pursuant to the amendment, RYAM is required

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Working collaboratively with our lenders at Oaktree, we reached an amendment that gives us access to liquidity and provides operational flexibility to
execute our strategy,&#148; said De Lyle Bloomquist, President and Chief Executive Officer. &#147;While we remain confident that we could have managed within the covenant, the added flexibility should provide comfort to key stakeholders, including
debt and equity investors, as we execute on our strategy to improve the balance sheet and grow our biomaterials business.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Wachtell, Lipton,
