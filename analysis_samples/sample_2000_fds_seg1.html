                   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
               ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
                      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

                       September 30, 1996

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     The Company's working capital decreased by $30,000 in the
first nine months of 1996 compared to an increase of $771,000 for
the same period in 1995.  The increase in working capital for the
nine months ended September 30, 1995, was primarily due to the
change of current loans payable to long term debt.  The decrease
in working capital for the nine months ended September 30, 1996
is primarily due to the decrease in accounts receivable and cash.


     The total of loans payable to Bank as of September 30, 1996,
was $3,800,000 compared to $3,750,000 at December 31, 1995.

     Bank provided the Company with an additional $1,000,000
working capital facility for 19xx at rate of 5%.  Of this amount,
$800,000 was advanced to the Company as of September 30, 19xx and
the remaining $200,000 was advanced to the Company as of October
00, 19xx.  The current borrowings were utilized for capital
expenditures and operations.  On May 00, 19xx, Bank exchanged
$750,000 of long term debt for 750,000 shares of common stock
with a par value of $1.00 per share.  On October 00, 19xx, Bank
provided the Company an additional $750,000 credit facility for
the balance of 19xx and the year 19xx.  All loans made by Bank
under this facility as well as the loans payable at December 31,
19xx and which were not exchanged are due July 00, 19xx.

     All loans payable to Bank and future borrowings under any
such credit facilities have been collateralized by the accounts
receivable and machinery and equipment of the company.  The
additional funds required for operations and capital expenditures
were funded by long term loans from Bank.

     Bank is a partnership of which the Company's President is
a 60% partner and a director is a 40% partner.

<PAGE>



     The Company's capital expenditures in 19xx will be for
additional equipment to increase and improve the Company's
production capabilities and environmental improvements.


Results of Operations

     Net sales for the first nine months of 1996 were $3,215,000,
an increase of $56,000, or 2% over the same period in 1995.  This
increase in sales was primarily achieved in the first quarter
1996.  The increase in net sales for the nine month period ending
September 30, 1996 was primarily due to increased sales of
pharmaceutical intermediates partially offset by a decrease in
Photo/Film Chemical Sales.

     The operating loss for the first nine months of 1996
increased to $467,000 compared with a loss of $435,000 for the
same period in 1995.  This increased operating loss was primarily
a result of an increase in the cost of goods sold of $113,000 or
3.8%, without a corresponding increase in sales.  The increase in
cost of goods sold is primarily due to the increase in the cost
of manufacturing.  The operating loss for the three months ended
September 30, 1996 and selling , general and administrative
expenses for the three and nine months ending September 30, 1996
remained substantially unchanged from the same period in 1995.

     Interest expense for the first nine months increased $26,000
compared to the same period in 1995.  Interest expense for the
three months ending September 30, 1996, increased $6,000 compared
to the same period in 1995.  The increase in interest expense was
primarily due to higher loan balances.

     Financial Accounting Standard No. 96 "Accounting for Income
Taxes" which requires that no later than 19xx, companies change
from the deferred method to the liability method of accounting
for income taxes, has not been adopted by the Company for 19xx.
Implementation of the Standard is not expected to have any
material affect on the Company's financial condition or results
of operations.
