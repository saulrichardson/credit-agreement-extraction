had against the Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person. The U.S. Borrower also agrees with the Issuing
Lender that the Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and the U.S. Borrower&rsquo;s Reimbursement Obligations under Section&nbsp;3.5
shall not be affected by, among other things, (a)&nbsp;any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement,
or any term or provision therein, (b)&nbsp;any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be invalid, fraudulent
or forged in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (c)&nbsp;any dispute between or among such
Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims
whatsoever of the U.S. Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee, (d)&nbsp;payment by the Issuing
Lender under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter
of Credit, or (e)&nbsp;any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the U.S. Borrower&rsquo;s
obligations hereunder; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Lender from liability to the U.S. Borrower
to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are
hereby waived by the U.S. Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the U.S. Borrower that are caused by the Issuing
Lender&rsquo;s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply
with the terms thereof. The Issuing Lender shall not have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance
or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances
referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft,
notice or message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a
drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Lender; <U>provided</U> that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Lender from liability to the U.S. Borrower
to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are
hereby waived by the U.S. Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the U.S. Borrower that are caused by the Issuing
Lender&rsquo;s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply
with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part
of the Issuing Lender (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have exercised
care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that,
with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit,
the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such
documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.</P>

protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon any Loan Party or any other
Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect,

Event of Default, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Administrative Agent at places which the Administrative Agent
shall reasonably select, whether at any Loan Party&rsquo;s premises or elsewhere. The Administrative Agent shall apply the net proceeds
of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8, after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in

the New York UCC, need the Administrative Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Loan Party. To the extent permitted by applicable
law, each of Holdings and each Borrower agrees on behalf of each itself and each other Loan Party that each Loan Party waives all claims,
damages and demands it may acquire against the Administrative Agent, any Syndication Agent, any Co-Documentation Agent or any Lender,
and any Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called a &ldquo;<U>Lender-Related Person</U>&rdquo;) arising
out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder. If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of Collateral shall be required

which a Loan Party is subject, or (b)&nbsp;at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or

which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership, limited partnership interests or membership interests, in any such
acquisition vehicle and/or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition
vehicle to take any further action, and (v)&nbsp;to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used
to acquire Collateral for any reason, such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Secured Parties pro rata and the equity
interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of such Obligations shall automatically be cancelled,
without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion
of the Obligations of each Secured Party are deemed assigned to the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii)&nbsp;above,
each Secured Party shall execute such documents and provide such information regarding the Secured Party (and/or any designee of the

consummation of the transactions contemplated by such credit bid.</P>

affects such Participant. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower Representative&rsquo;s request and expense,
to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower Representative to effectuate the provisions of Section&nbsp;2.22 with respect
to any Participant. Each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.18, 2.19 and 2.20 (subject
to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section&nbsp;2.19(f)&nbsp;(it being understood that the
documentation required under Section&nbsp;2.19(f)&nbsp;shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were

results from an adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by
any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
made subsequent to the date hereof that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. To the extent permitted by
law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section&nbsp;10.7(b)&nbsp;as though it were a Lender, <U>provided</U>
such Participant shall be subject to Section&nbsp;10.7(a)&nbsp;as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall,
acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant

Documents (the &ldquo;<U>Participant Register</U>&rdquo;); <U>provided</U> that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or
any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant&rsquo;s

disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section&nbsp;5f.103-1(c)&nbsp;of
the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender

Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect,

Each Grantor further agrees, at the Administrative Agent&rsquo;s request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Administrative
Agent at places which the Administrative Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor&rsquo;s premises or elsewhere. The Administrative
Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6.6, after deducting all reasonable costs
and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any
way relating to the Collateral or the rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable

including, without limitation, Section&nbsp;9-615(a)(3)&nbsp;of the New York UCC, need the Administrative Agent account for the surplus,
if any, to any Grantor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire
against the Administrative Agent or any Lender arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder. If any notice of a proposed
sale or other Disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least
10 days before such sale or other Disposition.</FONT></P>

protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other
Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived), may in such circumstances forthwith collect,

to purchase, or otherwise Dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one

Lender or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit

public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of
the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released.
Each Grantor further agrees, at the Administrative Agent&rsquo;s request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Administrative
Agent at places which the Administrative Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor&rsquo;s premises or elsewhere. The Administrative
Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any action taken by it pursuant to this Section&nbsp;6.6, after deducting all reasonable costs
and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith or incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any
way relating to the Collateral or the rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys&rsquo; fees and disbursements, to the payment in whole or in part of the Canadian Obligations, in the order provided in Section&nbsp;6.5,
and only after such application and after the payment by the Administrative Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law,
need the Administrative Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor
waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Administrative Agent or any Lender arising out of the exercise by them
of any rights hereunder. If any notice of a proposed sale or other Disposition of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall
be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other Disposition.</P>

any such powers, any such Receiver shall, to the extent permitted by law, act as and for all purposes shall be deemed to be the agent

appoint, ratify the appointment by the Administrative Agent of or otherwise supervise in any manner the action of any Receiver. Upon
any Grantor receiving notice from the Administrative Agent of the taking of possession of the Collateral or appointment of a Receiver,
