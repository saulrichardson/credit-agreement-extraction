                        NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                OCTOBER 31, 1995


NOTE A - Condensed Financial Statements

The condensed balance sheet as of October 31, 1995, the condensed 
statements of earnings for the six month  and three month periods ended 
October 31, 1995 and 1994, and the condensed statements of cash flows 
for the six month periods ended October 31, 1995 have been prepared by 
the Company without audit.  These financial statements reflect all 
adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair 
statement of the results for the interim periods presented.  All 
adjustments made during the quarter ended October  31, 1995 are of a 
normal recurring nature.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in 
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles have been omitted.  It is suggested that these 
condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial 
statements and notes thereto included in the Company's annual report on 
Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 1995.  The results of operations 
for the period, ended October 31, 1995 are not necessarily indicative of 
the operating results for the full year.

NOTE B - Reclassification

Certain amounts previously reported have been reclassified to be 
consistent with the classifications being used in the current period.

NOTE C - Acquisition

On July 31, 1995, the Company acquired a new company at a net cost of 
$350,000, CimSoft Incorporated.  CimSoft had offices in Michigan and 
California.  It was the exclusive distributor for all of Cimage 
Enterprises Systems, Limited (CESL) products in North America.  These 
products are sold under the trade name "Cimage" in markets similar to 
those the Company has served for many years.

The Company expects to expand their ability to serve its existing 
markets through new product offerings, broader sales and distribution 
coverage, and continued growth in its customer service programs.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:

The Company has two primary lines of business.  Over the years the 
Company has built a substantial, continuing field maintenance business.  
This business services, on a nationwide basis, hardware and, on a 
national and international basis, software for the Company's installed 
base of customers and third parties.  The company is also a leader in 
the Technical Document Management Systems (TDMS) software business.  In 
this line of business, the Company develops and markets software 
solutions for its customers' technical processes.  TDMS has the 
potential for substantial growth in revenue and profits in that it 
serves a potentially large, worldwide market opportunity.

Fiscal year 1996 second quarter revenue of $2.1 million was up $500,700 
(31%) compared with the second quarter of fiscal 1995. Service/Manufacturing 
revenue of $1.2 million decreased $97,900 (8%) compared with the second
quarter of fiscal 1995.  TDMS revenue of $944,300 increased $598,700 (173%)
compared with the second quarter of fiscal 1995.  In the first quarter of
fiscal 1996 the Company acquired CimSoft Incorporated.  This acquisition
included a substantial TDMS order in the amount of $439,700 which was 
delivered in August 1995.  The Company also completed a major TDMS contract
in the month of October totaling $221,600.  The reduction in
Service/Manufacturing is due to a re-certification order received for
 $159,900 in October 1994. 

Revenue for the first six months of fiscal 1996 of $3.5 million 
increased 11% from the six months ended October 31, 1994.  TDMS revenue 
of  $1,160,400 was 51% higher than the same period last year.  This 
increase was due to the recognition of revenue of the CimSoft order 
received in the acquisition, which represented $373,700 of revenue as 
well as the settlement on a major contract in the amount of $221,600.  
Service/ Manufacturing revenue of $2.3 million was essentially unchanged 
from the prior year.

The Company's current backlog of orders is $2.2 million compared to $3.5 
million at the end of the six months ended October 31, 1994.  Current 
TDMS backlog of $619,000  is 55%  lower than that at the same date last 
year.  This decrease in backlog is the result of the Company delivering 
a major order that was in backlog last fiscal year as well as the 
cancellation of a portion of that order. The order that was canceled was 
for development effort of a new product.  This customer decided to 
remain on their existing Access system.   Service/Manufacturing backlog  
of $1.6 million was 25% lower at October 31, 1995 compared with October 
31, 1994.  This reduction in backlog was due to the loss of some of the 
maintenance coverage on the Company's micrographic based systems 
delivered several years ago which the Company no longer manufactures.  
The Company expects this portion of its business to continue to decline.  
This Service/Manufacturing backlog is expected to be delivered within 
the next twelve months.

Cost of sales for the second quarter and six months ended October 31, 
1995 of 56% were within 9% and 8%, respectively, of those for the 
comparable periods in fiscal 1994. 

Selling and administrative expenses of  $578,100 for the second quarter 
of fiscal 1995 were $148,900 (35%) higher than the second quarter of 
fiscal 1995.  Selling and administrative expenses for the six months 
ended October 1995 of $915,800 were 9% higher than the same period last 
fiscal year.  Selling and administrative expenses increased due to the 
acquisition of CimSoft.  The Company will continue to grow the sales 
operation to take advantage of the sales opportunities resulting from 
the CimSoft acquisition.

<PAGE>

Engineering, research and development expenses are incurred for 
maintaining, upgrading and developing new products.  The second quarter 
expense for engineering, research and development of $140,900 increased 
$19,200 from the second quarter of last fiscal year.  This increase in 
development expense reflects the introduction of a new product, Cimage 
software.  This increase in development expense is the result of less 
time being applied to inventory projects, offset partially by a 
reduction in labor and other related expenses.

Interest income for the second quarter and six months ended October 31, 
1995 was $14,600 and $27,100, respectively, compared with ($800) and 
$200, respectively.  Interest income for fiscal 1995 was primarily the 
interest received on cash being invested in short term investments.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

During the first six months of fiscal 1996, the Company increased its 
cash balance by $33,700 leaving $917,200 in cash.  The Company provided 
$3,900 in cash from operations and invested $146,200 in fixed assets.  
The Company increased the cash $176,000 from investments for the 
acquisition of CimSoft through the collection of the Cimage Accounts 
Receivable, offset by a reduction in Customer Deposits and other 
liabilities.

Inventory has decreased $171,500 since April 30, 1995.  This decrease is 
due to work in process inventory on TDMS projects being delivered in the 
second quarter of fiscal 1996.

Accounts receivable increased $314,000 between April 30, 1995 and the 
end of October 1995.  The majority of this increase relates to a 
development contract completed in October 1995.   This receivable is 
expected to be collected before the end of fiscal 1996.

On large customer orders there are provisions for progress payments to 
be made by customers based on predetermined events.  These advances 
decreased approximately  $95,700 since April 30, 1995.  

Working capital on October 31, 1995 was approximately $2,026,300, which 
is $291,500 higher than the April 30, 1995 level.  This primarily was 
the result of the increase in cash, accounts receivables and prepaid 
expenses.

The Company's operations are structured so that revenues from its 
ongoing service business, in combination with the sale of new Cimage , 
AS/400 and UNIX products are expected to provide the cash flow required 
to operate the Company.
