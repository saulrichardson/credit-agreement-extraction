  OF FORMER BUSINESS UNIT</b> </font></h3>
<h5 align="center"><font face="Arial">Company Enters Voluntary Plea Agreement
  Related to Charges of Anti-Competitive Activities in Food Science Group, Sold
  in 1996. </font></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>NEW YORK, July 19 -</b> Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) announced
  today that it has entered into a voluntary agreement to plead guilty to antitrust
  charges by the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice involving
  Pfizer's former Food Science Group, a division that manufactured and sold food
  additives. Pfizer sold the Food Science Group in January 1996. Pfizer does not
  believe that this settlement will have a material effect on its business or
  results of operations. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Department of Justice has stated that no further antitrust
  charges will be brought against Pfizer relating to the former Food Science Group,
  and that there are no other pending antitrust investigations against Pfizer.
  The Department of Justice has also stated that it will not bring any charges
  against any current director, officer, or employee of Pfizer for any antitrust
  offenses involving the manufacture or sale of any products sold or produced
  by Pfizer's former Food Science Group. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In addition, the Department of Justice stated that none
  of Pfizer's current directors, officers or employees was aware of any aspect
  of the activity that gave rise to the charged Sherman Act violations. The Department
  of Justice has further stated that its investigation has uncovered no evidence
  of any antitrust violations relating to Pfizer's current business, or which
  suggests a current lack of integrity or business honesty on the part of Pfizer
  or its current management or employees. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> Under the agreement, Pfizer will plead guilty in Federal
  District Court in San Francisco to one count of price fixing of sodium erythorbate,
  a food additive, and one count of market allocation of maltols, flavor enhancers.
  The Company agreed to pay a total fine of $20 million. Pfizer deeply regrets
  these actions, which were contrary to the Company's clear, long-standing values,
  policies and practices.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"> The two food products that are the subject of the plea
  agreement involved a small component of Pfizer's business unrelated to the Company's
  core research-based pharmaceutical business. The combined annual sales of the
  two products accounted for less than 1% of annual Pfizer sales. Both products
  were manufactured and sold by Pfizer's former Food Science Group. Pfizer has
  not been involved in the marketing or sale of food additives for almost four
  years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Company stated that it was not aware of the investigation
  until the Department of Justice brought the matter to the Company's attention
  in early 1998. Once Pfizer became aware of this situation, it cooperated fully
  with the Department of Justice. The Company believes that this voluntary settlement
  is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Pfizer Inc is a research-based global pharmaceutical company
  that discovers, develops, manufactures and markets innovative medicines for
  humans and animals. The Company reported revenues of more than $13.5 billion
  in 1998 and expects to spend about $2.8 billion on research and development
  this year. In 1999, Pfizer celebrates its 150th anniversary. </font></p>
