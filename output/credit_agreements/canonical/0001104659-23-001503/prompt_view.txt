⟦s001236⟧ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document:
⟦s001237⟧ (a) Replacing USD LIBOR .
⟦s001238⟧ On March 5, 2021 the Financial Conduct Authority (“ FCA ”), the regulatory supervisor of USD LIBOR’s administrator (“ IBA ”), announced in a public statement the future cessation or loss of representativeness of overnight/Spot Next, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12- month USD LIBOR tenor settings.
⟦s001239⟧ On the earlier of (i) the date that all Available Tenors of USD LIBOR have either permanently or indefinitely ceased to be provided by IBA or have been announced by the FCA pursuant to public statement or publication of information to be no longer representative and (ii) the Early Opt-in Effective Date, if the then-current Benchmark is USD LIBOR, the Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any setting of such Benchmark on such day and all subsequent settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
⟦s001240⟧ If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a quarterly basis.
⟦s001241⟧ (b) Replacing Future Benchmarks .
⟦s001242⟧ Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, the Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.
⟦s001243⟧ At any time that the administrator of the then-current Benchmark has permanently or indefinitely ceased to provide such Benchmark or such Benchmark has been announced by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark pursuant to public statement or publication of information to be no longer representative of the underlying market and economic reality that such Benchmark is intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored, the Borrower may revoke any request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Loans to be made, converted or continued that would bear interest by reference to such Benchmark until the Borrower’s receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent that a Benchmark Replacement has replaced such Benchmark, and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans.
⟦s001244⟧ During the period referenced in the foregoing sentence, the component of ABR based upon the Benchmark will not be used in any determination of ABR.

⟦s001250⟧ (d) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations .
⟦s001251⟧ The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes.

⟦s001253⟧ (e) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark .
⟦s001254⟧ At any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term SOFR or USD LIBOR), then the Administrative Agent may remove any tenor of such Benchmark that is unavailable or non-representative for Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement) settings and (ii) the Administrative Agent may reinstate any such previously removed tenor for Benchmark (including Benchmark Replacement) settings.
⟦s001255⟧ (a) If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Borrowing:
⟦s001256⟧ (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining Adjusted Term SOFR for a Loan or for the applicable Interest Period; or
⟦s001257⟧ (ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that Adjusted Term SOFR for a Loan or for the applicable Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
⟦s001258⟧ then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders in the case of clause (ii) above) notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (x) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a SOFR Borrowing shall be ineffective and the Loans shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (y) if any borrowing request requests a SOFR Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

⟦s001265⟧ (iii) syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language similar to that contained in this Section 2.11, are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace SOFR,

⟦s001267⟧ If no SOFR Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause (b)(i) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.
⟦s001268⟧ Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) the SOFR component shall no longer be utilized in determining the Alternate Base Rate.
⟦s001269⟧ Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of ABR Loans (subject to the foregoing clause (y)) in the amount specified therein.
⟦s001270⟧ Notwithstanding anything else herein, any definition of SOFR Successor Rate shall provide that in no event shall such SOFR Successor Rate be less than the Floor for purposes of this Agreement.

⟦s002570⟧ Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
