and shall be determined without reference to clause (c) above. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Base Rate as determined pursuant

(2)  the
sum of: (a) the alternate benchmark rate that has been selected by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower as the replacement
for the then-current Benchmark for the applicable Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation
of a replacement benchmark rate or the mechanism for determining such a rate by the Relevant Governmental Body or (ii) any evolving
or then-prevailing market convention for determining a benchmark rate as a replacement for the then-current Benchmark for dollar-denominated
syndicated credit facilities at such time and (b) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment.

Adjustment ” means, with respect to any replacement of the then-current Benchmark with an Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for
any applicable Interest Period and Available Tenor for any setting of such Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement, the spread adjustment, or
method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) that has been selected
by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower for the applicable Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to (i) any selection
or recommendation of a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such
Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement by the Relevant Governmental Body on the applicable Benchmark Replacement
Date and/or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a spread adjustment, or method for calculating
or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for
dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities at such time.
“ Benchmark Replacement
Conforming Changes ” means, with respect to any Benchmark Replacement, any technical, administrative or operational changes
(including changes to the definition of “Base Rate,” the definition of “Business Day,” the definition of “U.S.
Government Securities Business Day,” the definition of “Interest Period,” or any similar or analogous definition, timing
and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest, timing of borrowing requests or prepayment, conversion or continuation
notices, length of lookback periods, the applicability of breakage provisions, and other technical, administrative or operational matters)
that the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Borrower, decides may be appropriate to reflect the adoption and implementation
of such Benchmark and to permit the administration thereof by the Administrative Agent in a manner substantially consistent with market
practice (or, if the Administrative Agent decides that adoption of any portion of such market practice is not administratively feasible
or if the Administrative Agent determines that no market practice for the administration of such Benchmark exists, in such other manner
of administration as the Administrative Agent, with the consent of the Borrower, decides is reasonably necessary in connection with the
administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents).
“ Benchmark Replacement
Date ” means, with respect to any Benchmark, the earliest to occur of the following events with respect to such then-current
Benchmark:
(1)              in
the case of clause (1) or (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Transition Event,” the later of (a) the date
of the public statement or publication of information referenced therein and (b) the date on which the administrator of such Benchmark
(or the published component used in the calculation thereof) permanently or indefinitely ceases to provide all Available Tenors of such
Benchmark (or such component thereof); or
(2)              in
the case of clause (3) of the definition of “Benchmark Transition Event,” the first date on which such Benchmark (or
the published component used in the calculation thereof) has been determined and announced by the relevant regulatory supervisor for
the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) to be no longer representative; provided, that such non-representativeness
will be determined by reference to the most recent statement or publication referenced in such clause (3) and even if any Available
Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) continues to be provided on such date.

For the avoidance of doubt,
(i) if the event giving rise to the Benchmark Replacement Date occurs on the same day as, but earlier than, the Reference Time in
respect of any determination, the Benchmark Replacement Date will be deemed to have occurred prior to the Reference Time for such determination
and (ii) the “Benchmark Replacement Date” will be deemed to have occurred in the case of clause (1) or (2) with
respect to any Benchmark upon the occurrence of the applicable event or events set forth therein with respect to all then-current Available
Tenors of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof).
“ Benchmark Transition
Event ” means, with respect to any Benchmark, the occurrence of one or more of the following events with respect to such then-current

public statement or publication of information by or on behalf of the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used
in the calculation thereof) announcing that such administrator has ceased or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark
(or such component thereof), permanently or indefinitely, provided that, at the time of such statement or publication, there is no successor
administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof);
(2)              a
public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published
component used in the calculation thereof), the Federal Reserve Board, the NYFRB, the CME Term SOFR Administrator, an insolvency official
with jurisdiction over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), a resolution authority with jurisdiction over the administrator
for such Benchmark (or such component) or a court or an entity with similar insolvency or resolution authority over the administrator
for such Benchmark (or such component), in each case, which states that the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component) has ceased
or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) permanently or indefinitely; provided that,
at the time of such statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of
such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or
(3)              a

Borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate and (iii) each RFR Loan shall bear interest

(ii)             If
any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to

2.08            Fees .
(a)              Revolving
Credit Fees . The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable
Percentage, a facility fee (the “ Facility Fee ”) equal to the amount in the “Facility Fee” column of the
Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Commitments (or, if the Aggregate Commitments have terminated, on the
Outstanding Amount of all Loans), regardless of usage, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.16 . The Facility Fee
shall accrue through and including the last day of March, June, September and December, and shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on the fifteenth Business Day following the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with
the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last day of the Maturity Date (and, if applicable, thereafter on demand).
The Facility Fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the
actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such
Applicable Rate was in effect.
(b)              Other
Fees . (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the
amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letters. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any
reason whatsoever.
(ii)              The
Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified.
Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
2.09            Computation
of Interest and Fees . All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the
Adjusted Term SOFR Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other
computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or
interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day
on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid,
 provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.11(a) , bear
interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error.
2.10            Evidence
of Debt .
The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall
be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business.
The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount
of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error
in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect
to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records
of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence
of manifest error. In addition, upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and
deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such
accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity
of its Loans evidenced thereby and payments with respect thereto.

2.11            Payments
Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback .
(a)              General .
Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 3.01 , all payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear
of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which
such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on
the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable
share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments
received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable
interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day,
payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees,
as the case may be.
(b)              (i)  Funding
by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to
the proposed date of any Loan of Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans (or, in the case of any Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the
date of such Loan) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Loan, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the
case of any Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02 )
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not
in fact made its share of the applicable Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally
agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon,
for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by
the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing
or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment
to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest
to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the
amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Loan to the Administrative
Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Loan. Any payment by the Borrower shall be
without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative
Agent.

(ii)              Payments
by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior
to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not
make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and
may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made
such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed
to such Lender, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed
to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined
by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
A notice of the Administrative
Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b)  shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.
(c)              Failure
to Satisfy Conditions Precedent . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such
Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower
or to fund such purchase, as the case may be, by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set
forth in Article IV , as applicable, are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent
shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
(d)              Obligations
of Lenders Several . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c)  are
several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation, to make any such purchase or to make
any payment under Section 10.04(c)  on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding
obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase
its participation, or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c) .
(e)              Funding
Source . Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner
or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or
manner.

2.12            Sharing
of Payments by Lenders .
(a)              Sharing
of Payments by Lenders . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect
of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such Lender’s receiving payment of a proportion of
the aggregate amount of such Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided
herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase
(for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that
the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued
interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:
(i)              if
any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest;
and
(ii)             the
provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant
to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting
Lender) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its
Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of
this Section shall apply).
Each Loan Party consents
to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant
to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.
2.13            [reserved] .
2.14            Increase
in Commitments; Addition of Incremental Term Loan Facilities .
(a)              Request
for Increase . Upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Borrower may from time to time
prior to the then applicable Maturity Date, request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments (each such increase, an “ Incremental
Revolving Increase ”) or add one or more tranches of term loans (each an “ Incremental Term Loan Facility ”;
each Incremental Term Loan Facility and each Incremental Revolving Increase are collectively referred to as “ Incremental Facilities ”)
to an amount (giving effect to all such Incremental Facilities) not exceeding $200,000,000; provided that (i) there exists
no Default, (ii) each increase must be in a minimum amount of $10,000,000 and in integral multiples of $5,000,000 in excess thereof
(or such other amounts as are agreed to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent), and (iii) the conditions to the making of
a Credit Extension set forth in clause (e) of this Section 2.14 shall be satisfied or waived. At the time of sending
such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the Lenders to be approached to provide all or
a portion of such increase (subject in each case to any requisite consents required under Section 10.06 ) and the time period
within which each such Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten (10) Business Days from the date
of delivery of such notice to such Lenders).

(b)              Lender
Elections to Increase . Each applicable Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent within the time period for response described
in Section 2.14(a)  whether or not it agrees to participate in the requested Incremental Facility and, if so, whether
by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than the portion of the requested Incremental Facility offered to it. Any Lender not responding
within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to participate in the requested Incremental Facility. No Lender shall be required
to increase its Revolving Commitment or make term loans under the Incremental Term Loan Facility, as applicable, to facilitate such Incremental
Facility.
(c)              Notification
by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders . The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders’
responses to each request made hereunder. Subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approvals shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and, in the case of an Incremental Revolving Increase, the Borrower may also invite additional Eligible
Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
and its counsel (a “ New Lender Joinder Agreement ”).
(d)              Effective
Date and Allocations . If the Revolving Commitments are increased or term loans shall be made under any Incremental Term Loan Facility,
as applicable, in accordance with this Section 2.14, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective date
(the “ Increase Effective Date ”) and the final allocation of such Incremental Facility. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such Incremental Facility and the Increase Effective Date.
(e)              Conditions
to Effectiveness of Incremental Facility . As conditions precedent to the effectiveness of each such Incremental Facility, each of
the following requirements shall be satisfied on or prior to the applicable Increase Effective Date:
(i)              the
Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of the Borrower dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient

(1) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by each Loan Party approving or consenting to such Incremental Facility or
(2) certifying that, as of such Increase Effective Date, the resolutions delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders on
the Closing Date (which resolutions include approval to increase the aggregate principal amount of all commitments and outstanding loans
under this Agreement to an amount at least equal to the Incremental Revolving Increase amount) are and remain in full force and effect
and have not been modified, rescinded or superseded since the date of adoption;
(B)              certifying
that, before and after giving effect to such Incremental Facility, (1) the representations and warranties contained in Article V  and
the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material respects (or if qualified by “materiality,”
 “material adverse effect” or similar language, in all respects (after giving effect to such qualification)) on and as of
the Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in
which case they are true and correct in all material respects (or if qualified by “materiality,” “material adverse
effect” or similar language, in all respects (after giving effect to such qualification)) as of such earlier date, and except
that for purposes of this Section 2.14 , the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a)  and (b)  of Section 5.05 
shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a)  and (b) ,

conditions of the Lenders providing such Incremental Facility shall be satisfied or waived;
(iv)            the
Administrative Agent shall have received (x) a New Lender Joinder Agreement duly executed by the Borrower and each Eligible Assignee,
if any, that is becoming a Lender in connection with such Incremental Facility, which New Lender Joinder Agreement shall be acknowledged
and consented to in writing by the Administrative Agent and (y) written confirmation from each existing Lender, if any, participating
in such Incremental Facility of the amount by which its Commitment will be increased, in the case of an Incremental Revolving Increase
or the amount of the term loan to be made by such Lender, in the case of an Incremental Term Loan Facility;
(v)             if
requested by the Administrative Agent or any new Lender or Lender participating in the Incremental Facility, the Administrative Agent
shall have received a customary opinion of counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent), addressed
to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, as to such customary matters concerning the Incremental Facility as the Administrative Agent
may reasonably request;
(vi)            the
Borrower shall provide a Note to any new Lender joining on the Increase Effective Date, if requested; and
(vii)           upon
the reasonable request of any Lender made at least ten (10) days prior to the applicable Increase Effective Date, the Borrower shall
have provided to such Lender, and such Lender shall be reasonably satisfied with, the documentation and other information so requested

(f)              Settlement
Procedures . On each Increase Effective Date, promptly following fulfillment of the conditions set forth in clause (e) of
this Section 2.14 , the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of the occurrence of the Incremental Facility effected
on such Increase Effective Date and, in the case of a Revolving Credit Increase, the amount of the Commitments and the Applicable Percentage
of each Lender as a result thereof, and in the case of an Incremental Term Loan Facility, the allocated portion and applicable percentage
of each Lender participating in such Incremental Term Loan Facility and each such participating Lender shall make a term loan to the
Borrower equal to its allocated portion of such Incremental Term Loan Facility. In the event that an Incremental Revolving Increase results
in any change to the Applicable Percentage of any Lender, then on the Increase Effective Date, as applicable, (i) any new Lender,
and any existing Lender whose Commitment has increased, shall pay to the Administrative Agent such amounts as are necessary to fund its
new or increased Applicable Percentage of all existing Loans, (ii) the Administrative Agent will use the proceeds thereof to pay
to all existing Lenders whose Applicable Percentage is decreasing such amounts as are necessary so that each Lender’s share of
all Loans, will be equal to its adjusted Applicable Percentage, and (iii) the Borrower shall pay any amounts required pursuant to
 Section 3.05 on account of the payments made pursuant to clause (ii) of this sentence.
(g)              Amendments .

as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:
(i)              Waivers

by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08 shall be applied at such time or times as
may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender
to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists),
to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement,
as determined by the Administrative Agent; third , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in
a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with
respect to Loans under this Agreement; fourth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s
breach of its obligations under this Agreement; fifth , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any
amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such
Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth , to
such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is
a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share,
and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such
payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment
of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments
hereunder without giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv) . Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting
Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.16(a)(ii)  shall
be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

Fees .
(A)              Each
Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Facility Fees payable under Section 2.08(a)  for any period during which
that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to extent allocable to the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the Loans funded by it.
(B)              With
respect to any Facility Fee payable under Section 2.08(a)  or any not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant
to clause (B)  above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.
(iv)            [reserved] .
(v)             [reserved] .
(vi)            Defaulting
Lender Cure . If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative
Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set
forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or
take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by
the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages (without giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv) ), whereupon such
Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued
or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided , further , that
except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute
a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

(i)              Any
and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding
for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Administrative
Agent or a Loan Party, as applicable) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Administrative Agent
or a Loan Party, then the Administrative Agent or such Loan Party shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely
pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, and to the extent
that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased
as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 3.01 ) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such withholding or deduction been made.

Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01 ) payable or paid by such Recipient
or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate

the provisions of Section 10.06(d)  relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Administrative
Agent and the Loan Parties, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender that are payable or paid by the Administrative
Agent or a Loan Party in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether
or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount
of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender
hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement
or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii) .
(d)              Evidence
of Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 3.01 ,

deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit
such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested
by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such
Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding
two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A) ,
 (ii)(B)  and (ii)(D)  below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion,
execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal
or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii)              Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person,

exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with
respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing

Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number
of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement
(and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other
form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed,
together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D)              if
a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were
to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of
the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law
and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable
law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested
by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations
under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount
to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments
made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(iii)              Each
Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes
obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(f)              Treatment
of Certain Refunds . Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for
or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from
funds paid for the account of such Lender. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith that it has received
a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional
amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01 , it shall pay to the Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent
of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, a Loan Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving
rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than
any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Loan Party, upon the
request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed
by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental
Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay
any amount to the Loan Party pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net
after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not
been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never
been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information
relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person.

(g)              Survival .
Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative
Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction
or discharge of all other Obligations.
3.02              Illegality .
If any Lender determines in good faith that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is
unlawful, for any Lender or its Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or make, maintain or fund or charge interest
with respect to any Credit Extension or to determine or charge interest rates based upon Term SOFR or Daily Simple SOFR, or any Governmental
Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the
applicable offshore interbank market then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any
obligation of such Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Credit Extension or continue Term
Benchmark Loans or to maintain RFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans or RFR Loans to Term Benchmark Loans or to convert Term Benchmark
Loans or Base Rate Loans to RFR Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or
maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate component of the Base
Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative
Agent without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the
Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term Benchmark
Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such
illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate component of the Base Rate), in
the case of Term Benchmark Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain
such Term Benchmark Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loans
and, in the case of RFR Loans, immediately and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging
interest rates based upon the Term Benchmark, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate
applicable to such Lender without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised
in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Adjusted
Term SOFR Rate or Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate, as the case may be. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also
pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

to clauses (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this Section 3.03, if:
(i)              the
Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) (A) prior to the commencement of
any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Term
SOFR Rate (including because the Term SOFR Reference Rate is not available or published on a current basis), for such Interest Period
or (B) at any time, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate;
or
(ii)             the
Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark
Borrowing, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender)
of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period or (B) at any time, Adjusted
Daily Simple SOFR Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans
(or its Loan) included in such Borrowing;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice
thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until (x) the

then all other Types of Borrowings shall be permitted. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan is outstanding on the date
of the Borrower’s receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent referred to in this ‎Section 3.03(a) with respect
to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower
and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the
Borrower delivers a new Interest Election Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.08 or a new Borrowing Request in accordance
with the terms of Section 2.02, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such
Loan, be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Borrowing so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple
SOFR Rate is not also the subject of Section 3.03(a)(i) or (ii) above or (y) a Base Rate Loan if the Adjusted Daily
Simple SOFR Rate also is the subject of Section 3.03(a)(i) or (ii) above, on such day, and (2) any RFR Loan shall

Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action
or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) any occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event and
its related Benchmark Replacement Date, (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (iii) the effectiveness of any
Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (iv) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (d) below

any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date
and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and

in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 3.03.
(f)              Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark
Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Rate) and either (A) any tenor for
such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the
Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided
a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative,

either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is
not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark

subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (B) a Base Rate Borrowing if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR Rate is the subject of a

not an Available Tenor, the component of Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable,
will not be used in any determination of the Base Rate. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan is outstanding on the date

(i)              impose,
modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits
with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e ));

on any Lender, any cost or expense affecting this Agreement, RFR Loans or Term Benchmark Loans made by such Lender;

Field: /Page
and the result of any of the foregoing shall
be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation
to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest
or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)              Capital
Requirements . If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such
Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement,
the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding
company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such
Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction
suffered.
(c)              Certificates
for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding
company as specified in subsection (a)  or (b)  of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be
conclusive absent manifest error; provided that, in any such certificate, such Lender shall certify that the claim for compensation
referred to therein is generally consistent with such Lender’s treatment of other borrowers of such Lender in the U.S. leveraged
loan market with respect to similarly affected commitments, loans and/or participations under agreements with such borrowers having provisions
similar to this Section 3.04, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein.
The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d)              Delay
in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 
shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not
be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or
reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the
Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
(e)              Reserves
on Term Benchmark Loans . The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with
respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Term Benchmark funds or deposits (currently known as “ Term Benchmark
liabilities ”), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Term Benchmark Loan equal to the actual costs of
such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive),
which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have received
at least 10 days’ prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender. If a Lender
fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 days from
receipt of such notice.

3.05            Compensation
for Losses . Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate
such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
(a)              any
continuation, conversion or prepayment of any principal of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or RFR Loan on a day other than the last
day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
(b)              any
failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any
Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or an RFR Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
(c)              any
assignment of a Term Benchmark Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13 ;
excluding any loss of anticipated profits and
any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to
terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by
such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by
the Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05 , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Term Benchmark Loan
made by it at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the applicable offshore interbank
market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Term Benchmark Loan was in fact so funded.
3.06            Mitigation
Obligations; Replacement of Lenders .
(a)              Designation
of a Different Lending Office . Each Lender may make any Credit Extension to the Borrower through any Lending Office, provided that
the exercise of this option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Credit Extension in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 , or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified
Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 ,
or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02 , then at the request of the Borrower such Lender shall, as applicable,
use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment
(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04 , as the case may be, in the future,
or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02 , as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject
such Lender to unreimbursed costs or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby
agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different

and the trust related thereto has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(a) of
the Code or an application for such a letter is currently pending before the Internal Revenue Service and, to the knowledge of Borrower,
nothing has occurred subsequent to the issuance of the determination letter which would cause such employee benefit plan or Plan to lose
its qualified status; and (vi) no liability to the PBGC (other than required premium payments), the Internal Revenue Service, any

to any matters not expressly provided for herein and in the other Loan Documents (including enforcement or collection), the Administrative
Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and
shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the written instructions of the Required Lenders (or such other
number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, pursuant to the terms in the Loan Documents), and, unless and until revoked
in writing, such instructions shall be binding upon each Lender; provided , however, that the Administrative Agent shall not be
required to take any action that (i) the Administrative Agent in good faith believes exposes it to liability unless the Administrative
Agent receives an indemnification and is exculpated in a manner satisfactory to it from the Lenders with respect to such action or (ii) is
contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or applicable law, including any action that may be in violation of the automatic
stay under any requirement of law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of debtors or that may effect a forfeiture,
modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any requirement of law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency
or reorganization or relief of debtors; provided , further , that the Administrative Agent may seek clarification or direction

reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably
assured to it.
(c)              In
performing its functions and duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent is acting solely on behalf

Administrative Agent does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or duty or any other relationship as the
agent, fiduciary or trustee of or for any Lender, other than as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, regardless
of whether a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (and it is understood and agreed that the use of the term
 “agent” (or any similar term) herein or in any other Loan Document with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended
to connote any fiduciary duty or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law, and that
such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting
parties); additionally, each Lender agrees that it will not assert any claim against the Administrative Agent based on an alleged breach
of fiduciary duty by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby; and

through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform
any of their respective duties and exercise their respective rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory
provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities pursuant to this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible
for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agent except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and
nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in the selection of
such sub-agent.
(e)              No
Arranger shall have obligations or duties whatsoever in such capacity under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and shall incur
no liability hereunder or thereunder in such capacity, but all such persons shall have the benefit of the indemnities provided for hereunder.
(f)               In
case of the pendency of any proceeding with respect to any Loan Party under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership
or similar law now or hereafter in effect, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or any reimbursement
obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative
Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding
or otherwise:
(i)         to
file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, LC Credit Extensions
and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have
the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
(ii)         to
collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same.
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee,
liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender to make such payments to
the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the
Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due to it, in its capacity as the Administrative Agent, under the Loan Documents.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf
of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender
or to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

(iv)         Assignment
and Assumption . The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption,

Assignment to Certain Persons . No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates

funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but
not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay
and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and
interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans in accordance with its
Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender
hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of
such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.

of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of
an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall
cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01 , 3.04 , 3.05 , and
 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided , that
except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver
or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower
(at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations
under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d)  of this Section.

for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of
the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “ Register ”). The entries in the
Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. Upon the
written request of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall provide copies of the Register to the Borrower, and the Register shall

reasonable prior notice.
(d)              Participations .

Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit
of a natural Person, a Defaulting Lender, a Disqualified Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries)
(each, a “ Participant ”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement

under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and

Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement
and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described
in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled
to the benefits of Sections 3.01 , 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest
by assignment pursuant to subsection (b)  of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under
 Section 3.01(e)  shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender
and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b)  of this Section; provided that such Participant
(A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.13 as if it were an assignee under paragraph
(b)  of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04 ,
with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive,
except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired
the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable
efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To the
extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender;
provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.12 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a
participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters
the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the
Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “ Participant Register ”); provided that no Lender shall
have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information
relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document)
to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other
obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant
Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant
Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant
Register.
(e)              Certain
Pledges . Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
(including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to
a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any
of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(f)              [reserved] .
(g)             Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no assignment may be made or participation sold to a Disqualified Lender without the prior written consent of the Borrower.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, if any Lender was a Disqualified Lender
at the time of the assignment of any Loans or Commitments to such Lender, following written notice from the Borrower to such Lender and
the Administrative Agent: (1) such Lender shall promptly assign all Loans and Commitments held by such Lender to an Eligible Assignee;
 provided that (A) the Administrative Agent shall not have any obligation to the Borrower, such Lender or any other Person
to find such a replacement Lender, (B) the Borrower shall not have any obligation to such Disqualified Lender or any other Person
to find such a replacement Lender or accept or consent to any such assignment to itself or any other Person subject to the Borrower’s
consent and (C) the assignment of such Loans and/or Commitments, as the case may be, shall be at par plus accrued and unpaid interest
and fees; (2) such Disqualified Lender shall not have any voting or approval rights under the Loan Documents and shall be excluded
in determining whether all Lenders, all affected Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including
any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to this Section 10.06(g)); provided that the Commitment of any Disqualified
Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Disqualified Lender.

to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or the Guarantor (in each case, other than the accounts pledged to secure the CMBS
Financing pursuant to the documents related thereto and any other account held for the benefit of another Person) against any and all
of the obligations of the Borrower or the Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such
Lender or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower or the Guarantor may be contingent or unmatured or
are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated
on such indebtedness; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts
so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.16
 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit
of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a
statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.
The rights of each Lender and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including
other rights of setoff) that such Lender or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity
of such setoff and application.

from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other
amounts);
(c)             in
the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made
pursuant to Section 3.01 , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
(d)             such
assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and
(e)             in
the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the
applicable amendment, waiver or consent, which vote shall count towards the approval of the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
A Lender shall not be required
to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling
the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

Regarding Any Supported QFCs . To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap
Contract or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit Support”, and each such QFC, a “ Supported
QFC ”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with
the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “ U.S. Special Resolution Regimes ”) in respect of such Supported QFC and
QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be
stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
(a)         In
the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “ Covered Party ”) becomes subject to a proceeding

and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or
such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S.
Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property)
were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of
a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that
might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted
to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported
QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the
foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event
affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
(b)         As
used in this Section 10.20, the following terms have the following meanings:
“ BHC Act Affiliate ”

such party.
“ Covered Entity ”
means any of the following: (i) a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12
C.F.R. § 252.82(b); (ii) a “covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R.
 § 47.3(b); or (iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §
382.2(b).
“ Default Right ”
has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1,
as applicable.

Article XI.  GUARANTY
11.01         Guaranty .
The Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees, jointly and severally, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not
merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand
or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all of the Obligations, whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities,
damages, costs, expenses or otherwise, of the Borrower to the Lenders, and whether arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document
(including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys’ fees and
expenses incurred by the Lenders in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof). The Administrative Agent’s books and
records showing the amount of the Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon
the Guarantor, and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Obligations absent demonstrable error. This Guaranty
shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing
any Obligations, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations
of the Guarantor under this Guaranty, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in
any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.
Anything contained in this
Guaranty to the contrary notwithstanding, it is the intention of the Guarantor and the Lenders that the obligations of the Guarantor
hereunder at any time shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder
subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States (Title
11, United States Code) or any comparable provisions of any similar federal or state law. To that end, the Guarantor’s obligations
with respect to the Obligations or any payment made pursuant to such Obligations would, but for the operation of the first sentence of
this paragraph, be subject to avoidance or recovery in any such proceeding under applicable Debtor Relief Laws, the amount of the Guarantor’s
obligations with respect to the Obligations shall be limited to the largest amount which, after giving effect thereto, would not, under
applicable Debtor Relief Laws, render the Guarantor’s obligations with respect to the Obligations unenforceable or avoidable or
otherwise subject to recovery under applicable Debtor Relief Laws. To the extent any payment actually made pursuant to the Obligations
exceeds the limitation of the first sentence of this paragraph and is otherwise subject to avoidance and recovery in any such proceeding
under applicable Debtor Relief Laws, the amount subject to avoidance shall in all events be limited to the amount by which such actual
payment exceeds such limitation, and the Obligations as limited by the first sentence of this paragraph shall in all events remain in
full force and effect and be fully enforceable against the Guarantor. The first sentence of this paragraph is intended solely to preserve
the rights of the Lenders hereunder against the Guarantor in such proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Debtor Relief
Laws and neither the Guarantor, the Borrower nor any other Person shall have any right or claim under such sentence that would not otherwise
be available under applicable Debtor Relief Laws in such proceeding.

11.02         Rights
of Lenders . The Guarantor consents and agrees that the Lenders may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand,
and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof (in each case, to the extent permitted hereunder): (a) amend,
amend and restate, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Obligations
or any part thereof; and (b) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Obligations. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any
manner or to any extent vary the risks of the Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge
of the Guarantor.
11.03         Certain
Waivers . The Guarantor waives to the fullest extent permitted by Law (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or
other defense of the Borrower, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Lender, but excluding
satisfaction thereof by way of payment) of the liability of the Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that the Guarantor’s
obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrower; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting the
Guarantor’s liability hereunder; (d) any right to proceed against the Borrower or pursue any other remedy in the power of
any Lender whatsoever; and (e) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived
from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties (in each case, other than a defense
relating to indefeasible payment in full of the Obligations). The Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments,
demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all
other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty
or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Obligations.
11.04         Obligations
Independent . The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are those of a primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent
of the Obligations, and a separate action may be brought against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Borrower or
any other Person or entity is joined as a party.
11.05         Subrogation .
The Guarantor shall not exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any
payments it makes under this Guaranty until all Commitments have been terminated and all of the Obligations and any amounts payable under
this Guaranty (in each case, other than contingent indemnification and expense reimbursement obligations to the extent no claim has been
asserted therefor) have been paid in full. If any amounts are paid to the Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such
amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the Lenders to reduce the amount of the
Obligation s , whether matured or unmatured.

11.06         Termination;
Reinstatement . This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain
in full force and effect until all Commitments are terminated and all Obligations and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty (in
each case, other than contingent indemnification and expense reimbursement obligations to the extent no claim has been asserted therefor)
have been paid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case
may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower is made, or any of the Lenders exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the
Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent
or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any of the Lenders in their discretion)
to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise,
all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Lenders are in possession of or have
released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations of the Guarantor
under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.
11.07         Subordination .
The Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of the Borrower owing to the Guarantor, whether now
existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of the Borrower to the Guarantor as subrogee of the Lenders
or resulting from the Guarantor’s performance under this Guaranty, to the payment in full in cash of all Obligations. If the Lenders
so request during the continuance of an Event of Default, any such obligation or indebtedness of the Borrower to the Guarantor shall
be enforced and performance received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Lenders and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the Lenders
on account of the Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty.
11.08         Stay
of Acceleration . If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced
by or against the Borrower or the Guarantor under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable
by the Guarantor not subject to such stay immediately upon demand by the Lenders.
11.09         Condition
of the Borrower . The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining
from the Borrower such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrower as the Guarantor requires,
and that none of the Lenders has any duty, and the Guarantor is not relying on the Lenders at any time, to disclose to the Guarantor
any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrower (the Guarantor waiving any duty on the part
of the Lenders to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).
11.10         Limitations
on Enforcement . If, in any action to enforce this Guaranty or any proceeding to allow or adjudicate a claim under this Guaranty,
a court of competent jurisdiction determines that enforcement of this Guaranty against the Guarantor for the full amount of the Obligations
is not lawful under, or would be subject to avoidance under, Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable provision of comparable
state law, the liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be limited to the maximum amount lawful and not subject to avoidance
under such law.
