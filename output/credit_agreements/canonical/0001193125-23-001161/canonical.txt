 ARTICLE II 
 REGISTRATION RIGHTS 2.1
 Registration . (a) Request . Any Holder(s) of Registrable Securities (collectively, the “ Initiating Holder ”)
shall have the right (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with its rights pursuant to Section  2.7 ) to request that HealthCare file a Registration Statement with the SEC on the appropriate registration form
for all or part of the Registrable Securities held by such Initiating Holder by delivering a written request to HealthCare specifying the aggregate number of shares of Registrable Securities such Initiating Holder wishes to Register (a
“ Demand Registration ”). HealthCare shall (i) within five (5) days of the receipt of such request, give written notice of such Demand Registration to all Holders of Registrable Securities (the “ HealthCare
Notice ”), (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file a Registration Statement as expeditiously as possible in respect of such Demand Registration and in any event 
   7
within thirty (30) days of receipt of such request, and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective as expeditiously as possible.
HealthCare shall include in such Registration all Registrable Securities that the Holders request to be included within the ten (10) days following their receipt of the HealthCare Notice. 
 (b) Limitations of Demand Registrations . There shall be no limitation on the number of Demand Registrations pursuant to
 Section  2.1(a) ; provided , however , that the Holder(s) may not require HealthCare to effect a Demand Registration within sixty (60) days after the effective date of a previous registration by HealthCare,
other than a Shelf Registration, effected pursuant to this Section  2.1 . In the event that any Person shall have received rights to Demand Registrations pursuant to Section  2.7 or
 Section  4.3 , and such Person shall have made a Demand Registration request, such request shall be treated as having been made by the Holder(s). The Registrable Securities requested to be Registered pursuant to
 Section  2.1(a) must represent (i) an aggregate offering price of Registrable Securities that is reasonably expected to equal at least $100,000,000 (or its equivalent if the Registrable Securities are to be offered in
an Exchange Offer) or (ii) all of the remaining Registrable Securities owned by the requesting Holder and its Affiliates. (c)
 Effective Registration . HealthCare shall be deemed to have effected a Registration for purposes of Section  2.1(a) if the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC or becomes effective upon filing with
the SEC, and remains effective until the earlier of (i) the date when all Registrable Securities thereunder have been Sold and (ii) (x) in case of a Registration Statement that is not a Shelf Registration Statement, 60 days from the
effective date of the Registration Statement or (y) 12 months from the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement (such period, as applicable, the “ Registration Period ”). No Registration shall be deemed to have been
effective if the conditions to closing specified in the underwriting agreement or dealer-manager agreement, if any, entered into in connection with such Registration are not satisfied by reason of any member of the HealthCare Group. If, during the
Registration Period, such Registration is interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other Governmental Authority or the need to update or supplement the Registration Statement, the Registration Period
shall be extended on a day-for-day basis for any period the Holder is unable to complete an offering as a result of such stop order, injunction or other order or
requirement of the SEC or other Governmental Authority. (d) Underwritten Offering; Exchange Offer . If the Initiating Holder so
indicates at the time of its request pursuant to Section  2.1(a) , such offering of Registrable Securities shall be in the form of an Underwritten Offering or an Exchange Offer and HealthCare shall include such information in
the HealthCare Notice. In the event that the Initiating Holder intends to Sell the Registrable Securities by means of an Underwritten Offering or Exchange Offer, the right of any Holder to include Registrable Securities in such Registration shall be
conditioned upon such Holder’s participation in such Underwritten Offering or Exchange Offer and the inclusion of such Holder’s Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Offering or Exchange Offer (provided that such Holder’s
Registrable Securities can only be excluded from such Underwritten Offering or Exchange Offer pursuant to the provisions of Section  2.1(e)) . 
   8
(e) Priority of Securities in an Underwritten Offering . If the managing underwriter
or underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering, including an Underwritten Offering from a Shelf Registration, pursuant to this Section  2.1 informs the Holders with Registrable Securities in the proposed Underwritten
Offering in writing that, in its or their opinion, the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Underwritten Offering exceeds the number that can be Sold in such Underwritten Offering without being likely to have an adverse
effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Registrable Securities offered or the market for the Registrable Securities offered, then the number of Registrable Securities to be included in such Underwritten Offering shall be reduced to such
number that can be Sold without such adverse effect based on the recommendation of the managing underwriter or underwriters and the Registrable Securities to be included in such Underwritten Offering shall be: (i) first, Registrable Securities
requested by all members of the GE Group to be included in such Underwritten Offering on a pro rata basis calculated based on the number of shares requested to be registered by all members of the GE Group; (ii) second, Registrable Securities
requested by all other Holders to be included in such Underwritten Offering on a pro rata basis calculated based on the aggregate number of shares requested to be registered; and (iii) third, all other Registrable Securities requested and
otherwise eligible to be included in such Underwritten Offering (including Registrable Securities to be Sold for the account of HealthCare) on a pro rata basis calculated based on the aggregate number of shares requested to be registered. In the
event the Initiating Holder notifies HealthCare that such Registration Statement shall be abandoned or withdrawn, such Holder shall not be deemed to have requested a Demand Registration pursuant to Section  2.1(a) , and
HealthCare shall not be deemed to have made a Demand Registration request pursuant to Section  2.1(a) and Section  2.1(c) . 
 (f) Shelf Registration . At any time after the date hereof when HealthCare is eligible to Register the applicable Registrable Securities
on Form S-3 and Holders may request Demand Registrations, the requesting Holders may request HealthCare to effect a Demand Registration as a Shelf Registration. Any Holder of Registrable Securities included on
a Shelf Registration shall have the right to request that HealthCare cooperate in a shelf takedown at any time, including an Underwritten Offering, by delivering a written request thereof to HealthCare specifying the number of shares of Registrable
Securities such Holder wishes to include in the shelf takedown (each, a “ Takedown Notice ”). HealthCare shall (i) within five (5) days of the receipt of a Takedown Notice for an Underwritten Offering, give written notice of
such Takedown Notice to all Holders of Registrable Securities included on such Shelf Registration (“ HealthCare Takedown Notice ”), and (ii) take all actions reasonably requested by such Holder, including the filing of a
Prospectus supplement and the other actions described in Section  2.4 , in accordance with the intended method of distribution set forth in the Takedown Notice, as soon as reasonably practicable. If the takedown is an
Underwritten Offering, HealthCare shall use its reasonable best efforts to include in such Underwritten Offering all Registrable Securities that that the Holders request to be included within the two (2) days following their receipt of the
HealthCare Takedown Notice. If the takedown is an Underwritten Offering, the Registrable Securities requested to be included in a shelf takedown must represent (i) an aggregate offering price of Registrable Securities that is reasonably
expected to equal at least $100,000,000 or (ii) all of the remaining Registrable Securities owned by the requesting Holder and its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, the requirement to deliver a
HealthCare Takedown Notice and the piggyback rights described in this Section  2.1(f) shall not apply to an Underwritten Offering that constitutes a Block Trade. There shall be no limitations on the number of Underwritten
Offerings pursuant to a Shelf Registration; provided , that in no event shall HealthCare be required to effect, pursuant to this Section  2.01(f) , during any 90-day period, more
than (A) two Block Trades or (B) more than one Underwritten Offering that is not a Block Trade pursuant to a Takedown Notice (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that a Takedown Notice shall not count as a Demand Registration
request for purposes of the limit set forth in Section  2.01(b) ). 
   9
(g) SEC Form . Except as set forth in the next sentence, HealthCare shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause Demand Registrations to be Registered on Form S-3, and if HealthCare is not then eligible under the Securities Act to use Form S-3, 
Demand Registrations shall be Registered on Form S-1 or Form S-4 (in the case of an Exchange Offer). If a Demand Registration is a Convertible or Exchange Registration,
HealthCare shall effect such Registration on the appropriate Form under the Securities Act for such Registrations. HealthCare shall use its reasonable best efforts to become eligible to use Form S-3 and, after
becoming eligible to use Form S-3, shall use its reasonable best efforts to remain so eligible. All Demand Registrations shall comply with applicable requirements of the Securities Act and, together with each
Prospectus included, filed or otherwise furnished by HealthCare in connection therewith, shall not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading. (h) With respect to any Registration Statement, whether filed or to be filed pursuant to this Agreement, if the
HealthCare board of directors in good faith shall reasonably determine, upon the advice of legal counsel, that maintaining the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or filing an amendment or supplement thereto (or, if no Registration
Statement has yet been filed, filing such a Registration Statement) would cause HealthCare to disclose material non-public information, which disclosure (x) would be required to be made in any
Registration Statement so that such Registration Statement would not be materially misleading, (y) would not be required to be made at such time but for the filing or effectiveness of such Registration Statement and (z) would be materially
detrimental to HealthCare or would materially interfere with any material financing, acquisition, corporate reorganization or merger or other similar transaction involving HealthCare or any of its subsidiaries, and that, as a result of such
potential disclosure or interference, it is in the best interests of HealthCare to defer the filing or effectiveness of such Registration Statement at such time or suspend the Holders’ use of any prospectus which is a part of the Registration
Statement (such disclosure, the “Disadvantageous Disclosure”), and (ii) HealthCare furnishes to the Holders a certificate signed by the chief executive officer of HealthCare to that effect, HealthCare may, for the shortest period
reasonably practicable, and in any event for not more than 30 consecutive calendar days (a “Blackout Period”), notify the Holders whose offers and Sales of Registrable Securities are covered (or to be covered) by such Registration
Statement that such Registration Statement is unavailable for use (or will not be filed as requested) (a “Blackout Notice”). Upon the receipt of any such Blackout Notice, the Holders shall forthwith discontinue use of the Prospectus
contained in any effective Registration Statement; provided that, if at the time of receipt of such Blackout Notice any Holder shall have Sold its Registrable Securities (or have signed a firm commitment underwriting agreement with respect to the
purchase of such shares) and the Disadvantageous Disclosure is not of a nature that would require a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, then HealthCare shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such action as to
eliminate any restriction imposed by federal securities Laws on the timely delivery of such Registrable Securities; provided, further, that, if implementation of such Blackout Period would impair the ability of GE, any member of the GE Group or any
of their 
   10
Transferees to Sell its Registrable Securities in accordance with its or their intended method of distribution, as determined by GE in its sole discretion, then HealthCare may not impose such
Blackout Period (and any Blackout Period then in effect shall automatically expire) and HealthCare shall as soon as reasonably possible revise, amend and/or supplement the Registration Statement, as applicable, so that it does not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. When any Disadvantageous Disclosure as to which a Blackout Notice
has been previously delivered shall cease to be required, HealthCare shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify the Holders and take such actions in respect of such Registration Statement as are otherwise required by this Agreement. The
Registration Period for any Registration Statement for which HealthCare has given notice of a Blackout Period shall be increased by the length of time of such Blackout Period. HealthCare shall not impose, in any
 365-day period, a Blackout Period (A) more than once and (B) lasting, in the aggregate, in excess of 60 calendar days. 
 2.2 Piggyback Registrations . 
 (a) Participation . If HealthCare proposes to file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to any offering of
HealthCare Common Stock for its own account or for the account of any other Persons (other than a Registration (i) under Section  2.1 , (ii) pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form
 S-8 or Form S-4 or similar form that relates to a transaction subject to Rule 145 under the Securities Act, (iii) pursuant to any form that does not include
substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a Registration Statement covering the Sale of Registrable Securities, (iv) in connection with any dividend reinvestment or similar plan, (v) for the sole purpose of
offering securities to another entity or its security holders in connection with the acquisition of assets or securities of such entity or any similar transaction or (vi) in which the only HealthCare Common Stock being Registered is HealthCare
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of debt securities that are also being Registered) (a “ HealthCare Public Sale ”), then, as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event less than fifteen (15) days prior to the proposed
date of filing such Registration Statement), HealthCare shall give written notice of such proposed filing to each Holder, and such notice shall offer such Holders the opportunity to Register under such Registration Statement such number of
Registrable Securities as each such Holder may request in writing (a “ Piggyback Registration ”). Subject to Section  2.2(a) and Section  2.2(c) , HealthCare shall include in such
Registration Statement all such Registrable Securities that are requested to be included therein within ten (10) days after the receipt of any such notice; provided , however , that if, at any time after giving written notice of its
intention to Register any securities and prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with such Registration, HealthCare shall determine for any reason not to Register or to delay Registration of such securities,
HealthCare may, at its election, give written notice of such determination to each such Holder and, thereupon, (i) in the case of a determination not to Register, shall be relieved of its obligation to Register any Registrable Securities in
connection with such Registration, without prejudice, however, to the rights of any Holder to request that such Registration be effected as a Demand Registration under Section  2.1 , and (ii) in the case of a
determination to delay Registration, shall be permitted to delay Registering any Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in Registering such other shares of HealthCare Common Stock. No Registration effected under this
 Section  2.2 shall relieve HealthCare of its obligation to effect any Demand Registration under Section  2.1 . If the 
   11
offering pursuant to a Registration Statement pursuant to this Section  2.2 is to be an Underwritten Offering, then each Holder making a request for a Piggyback
Registration pursuant to this Section  2.2(a) shall, and HealthCare shall use reasonable best efforts to coordinate arrangements with the underwriters so that each such Holder may, participate in such Underwritten Offering.
If the offering pursuant to such Registration Statement is to be on any other basis, then each Holder making a request for a Piggyback Registration pursuant to this Section  2.2(a) shall, and HealthCare shall use reasonable
best efforts to coordinate arrangements so that each such Holder may, participate in such offering on such basis. HealthCare’s filing of a Shelf Registration shall not be deemed to be a HealthCare Public Sale; provided , however ,
that the proposal to file any Prospectus supplement filed pursuant to a Shelf Registration with respect to an offering of HealthCare Common Stock for its own account or for the account of any other Persons will be a HealthCare Public Sale unless
such offering qualifies for an exemption from the HealthCare Public Sale definition in this Section  2.2(a) ; provided , further that if HealthCare files a Shelf Registration for its own account or for the
account of any other Persons, HealthCare agrees that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to include in such Registration Statement such disclosures as may be required by Rule 430B under the Securities Act in order to ensure that the Holders may
be added to such Shelf Registration at a later time through the filing of a Prospectus supplement rather than a post-effective amendment. 
 (b) Right to Withdraw . Each Holder shall (1) have the right to withdraw such Holder’s request for inclusion of its
Registrable Securities in any Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Section  2.2 at any time prior to the execution of an underwriting agreement with respect thereto, and (2) be permitted to withdraw all or part of
such Holder’s Registrable Securities from a Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effective date thereof, in each case by giving written notice to HealthCare of such Holder’s request to withdraw. 
 (c) Priority of Piggyback Registration . If the managing underwriter or underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering of a class of
Registrable Securities included in a Piggyback Registration informs HealthCare and the Holders in writing that, in its or their opinion, the number of securities of such class which such Holder and any other Persons intend to include in such
Underwritten Offering exceeds the number which can be Sold in such Underwritten Offering without being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered or the market for the securities offered, then the
securities to be included in such Underwritten Offering shall be reduced to such number that can be Sold without such adverse effect based on the recommendation of the managing underwriter or underwriters and the securities to be included in the
Underwritten Offering shall be (i) first, all securities of HealthCare or any other Persons for whom HealthCare is effecting the Underwritten Offering, as the case may be, proposes to Sell, (ii) second, Registrable Securities requested by
any member of the GE Group to be included in such Underwritten Offering on a pro rata basis calculated based on the number of shares requested to be registered by all members of the GE Group, (iii) third, Registrable Securities requested by all
other Holders to be included in such Underwritten Offering on a pro rata basis calculated based on the aggregate number of shares requested to be registered, and (iv) fourth, all other securities requested and otherwise eligible to be included
in such Underwritten Offering (including securities to be Sold for the account of HealthCare) on a pro rata basis calculated based on the aggregate number of shares requested to be registered.

when HealthCare becomes aware of the occurrence of any event as a result of which the applicable Registration Statement or the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (as then in effect) or any Ancillary Filing contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of such Prospectus and any preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading or, if

delivery to and addressed to each selling Holder and to the managing underwriter or underwriters or dealer-managers, if any, opinions from outside counsel or the general counsel for HealthCare, in each case dated the effective date of the
Registration Statement or, in the event of an Underwritten Offering, the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement or, in the event of an Exchange Offer, the date of the closing under the dealer-manager agreement or similar agreement or
otherwise, and in each such case in customary form and content for the type of Underwritten Offering or Exchange Offer, as applicable;

dealer-manager agreement; (xviii) use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and
make generally available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the end of the twelve (12)-month period beginning with the first day of HealthCare’s first quarter commencing
after the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement, an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and covering the period of at least
twelve (12) months, but not more than eighteen (18) months, beginning with the first month after the effective date of the Registration Statement; 
 (xix) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by the applicable Registration
Statement from and after a date not later than the effective date of such Registration Statement; (xx) cause all Registrable Securities
covered by the applicable Registration Statement to be listed on each securities exchange on which any of HealthCare’s securities are then listed or quoted and on each inter-dealer quotation system on which any of HealthCare’s securities

with such Registration Statement as shall be necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, subject to the foregoing; 
   17
(xxii) to cause the executive officers of HealthCare to participate in customary “road
show” presentations that may be reasonably requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters or dealer-managers in any Underwritten Offering or Exchange Offer and otherwise to facilitate, cooperate with, and participate in each proposed
offering contemplated herein and customary selling efforts related thereto; (xxiii) comply with all requirements of the Securities Act,
Exchange Act and other applicable Laws, rules and regulations, as well as applicable stock exchange rules; and (xxiv) take all other

precedent to any Registration hereunder, HealthCare may require each Holder as to which any Registration is being effected to furnish to HealthCare such information regarding the distribution of such securities and such other information relating to
such Holder, its ownership of Registrable Securities and other matters as HealthCare may from time to time reasonably request in writing. Each such Holder agrees to furnish such information to HealthCare and to cooperate with HealthCare as
reasonably necessary to enable HealthCare to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. (c) GE agrees, and any other Holder agrees by
acquisition of such Registrable Securities, that, upon receipt of any written notice from HealthCare of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in Section  2.4(a)(vi) , such Holder will forthwith discontinue the
Sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement until such Holder’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section  2.4(a)(vi) , or until such Holder is
advised in writing by HealthCare that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and if so directed by HealthCare, such Holder will deliver to HealthCare (at HealthCare’s expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such
Holder’s possession, of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice. In the event HealthCare shall give any such notice, the period during which the applicable Registration Statement is
required to be maintained effective shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when each seller of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement either receives the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section  2.4(a)(vi) or is advised in writing by HealthCare that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed. 
 2.5 Holdback Agreements . To the extent requested in writing by the managing underwriter or underwriters of any Underwritten Offering
and to the extent the Initiating Holder signs a lock-up agreement, HealthCare agrees not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain agreements (in the underwriters’ customary form) from its
directors, executive officers and any beneficial owner or owners (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of five percent (5%) or more of HealthCare Common Stock that has a
representative on the board of directors of HealthCare not to, directly or indirectly offer, Sell, pledge, contract to Sell (including any short Sale), grant any option to purchase or otherwise Sell any equity securities of HealthCare or enter into
any hedging transaction relating to any equity securities of HealthCare, during the ninety (90) days beginning on pricing date of such Underwritten Offering (except as 
   18
part of such Underwritten Offering or any Distribution or pursuant to registrations on Form S-8 or Form S-4) unless
the managing underwriter or underwriters otherwise agree to a shorter period. Each person subject to the restrictions of the preceding sentence shall receive the benefit of any shorter “lock-up” 
period or permitted exceptions agreed to by the managing underwriter or underwriters for any Underwritten Offering and the terms of such lock-up agreements shall govern such person in lieu of the preceding
sentence. 2.6 Underwritten Offerings; Exchange Offers . If requested by the managing underwriter or underwriters of any
Underwritten Offering or dealer-managers of any Exchange Offer, HealthCare shall enter into an underwriting agreement or dealer-manager agreement with such underwriters or dealer-managers for such offering; provided , however , that no
Holder shall be required to make any representations or warranties to HealthCare or the underwriters or dealer-managers (other than representations and warranties regarding such Holder and such Holder’s intended method of distribution) or to
undertake any indemnification obligations to HealthCare or the underwriters or dealer-managers with respect thereto, except as otherwise provided in Section  2.9 . 
 2.7 Convertible or Exchange Registration; Registration Rights with Participating Banks . 
 (a) If any Holder of Registrable Securities offers any options, rights, warrants or other securities issued by it or any other Person that are
offered with, convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any Registrable Securities, the Registrable Securities underlying such options, rights, warrants or other securities shall be eligible for Registration pursuant to
 Section  2.1 and Section  2.2 (a “ Convertible or Exchange Registration ”). 
 (b) If one or more members of the GE Group decides to engage, directly or indirectly, in an Exchange with one or more Participating Banks,
HealthCare shall, upon GE’s request, enter into a registration rights agreement with the Participating Banks in connection with such Exchange, as applicable, on terms and subject to conditions consistent with this Agreement (other than the
voting provisions contained in Article III ) and reasonably satisfactory to HealthCare and the GE Group. 2.8 Registration
Expenses Paid By HealthCare . In the case of any Registration of Registrable Securities required pursuant to this Agreement (including any Registration that is delayed or withdrawn) or proposed Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Agreement,
HealthCare shall pay all Registration Expenses regardless of whether the Registration Statement becomes effective or the Underwritten Offering is completed. 
 2.9 Indemnification . 
 (a) Indemnification by HealthCare . HealthCare agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, each Holder,
such Holder’s Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, advisors, and agents and each Person who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) such Persons from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities (or actions in respect thereof, whether or not such indemnified party is a party thereto) and expenses, joint or several (including reasonable costs of 
   19
investigation and legal expenses) (each, a “ Loss ” and collectively “ Losses ”) arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which the Sale of such Registrable Securities was Registered under the Securities Act (including any final or preliminary Prospectus contained therein or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or any documents incorporated by reference therein), or any such statement made in any free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) that HealthCare has filed or is required to file pursuant to Rule 433(d) under
the Securities Act, or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus or free writing
prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; provided , however , that HealthCare shall not be liable to any particular indemnified party in any such case to the extent that any such Loss arises
out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any such Registration Statement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to HealthCare by such indemnified
party expressly for use in the preparation thereof. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability HealthCare may otherwise have without duplication. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of such Holder or any indemnified party and shall survive the Sale of such securities by such Holder. (b) Indemnification
by the Selling Holder . Each selling Holder agrees (severally and not jointly) to indemnify and hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by law, HealthCare, its directors, officers, employees, advisors, and agents and each Person who controls
HealthCare (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) from and against any Losses arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement under
which the Sale of such Registrable Securities was Registered under the Securities Act (including any final or preliminary Prospectus contained therein or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by reference
therein), or any such statement made in any free writing prospectus that HealthCare has filed or is required to file pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus or free writing prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading to the extent, but,
in each case (i) or (ii), only to the extent, that such untrue statement or omission is made in reliance upon and conformity with any information furnished in writing by such selling Holder to HealthCare specifically for inclusion in such
Registration Statement, Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus or free writing prospectus. In no event shall the liability of any selling Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder (or the
fair value of the security received in an Exchange Offer) under the Sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation. This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the selling Holder may otherwise have without
duplication. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of HealthCare or any indemnified party. 
   20
(c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings . Any Person entitled to indemnification
hereunder will (i) as soon as reasonably practicable give written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification ( provided that any delay or failure to so notify the indemnifying party shall
relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder only to the extent that it is materially prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure) and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided , however , that any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select and employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such fees or expenses, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such
claim within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of such claim from the Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person, (iii) the indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on
advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, or (iv) in the reasonable judgment of any such Person, based
upon advice of its counsel, a conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ
separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such Person). If such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying
party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent, provided that such consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense, the indemnifying party
shall not have the right to settle such action without the consent of the indemnified party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. No indemnifying party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of an unconditional release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. It is understood that the
indemnifying party or parties shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges of more than one separate firm at any one time (in
addition to local counsel) from all such indemnified party or parties unless (x) the employment of more than one counsel has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party or parties, (y) an indemnified party has reasonably concluded
(based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the other indemnified parties or (z) in the reasonable judgment of an indemnified party, based upon
advice of its counsel, a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and the other indemnified parties, in each of which cases the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional
counsel or counsels. (d) Contribution . If for any reason the indemnification provided for in
 Section  2.9(a) or Section  2.9(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient to hold it harmless as contemplated by Section  2.9(a) or
 Section  2.9(b) , then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to 
   21
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. Notwithstanding anything in this Section  2.9(d) to the contrary, no indemnifying
party (other than HealthCare) shall be required pursuant to this Section  2.9(d) to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such indemnifying party from the Sale of Registrable
Securities in the offering to which the Losses of the indemnified parties relate (before deducting expenses, if any) exceeds the amount of any damages which such indemnifying party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue
statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section  2.9(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does
not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section  2.9(d) . Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section  2.9(d) , no selling Holder hereunder shall be required to
contribute any amount in excess of the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder (or the fair value of the security received in an Exchange Offer) under the Sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification
obligation. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The amount paid
or payable by an indemnified party hereunder shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section  2.9(d) , any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating,
preparing to defend or defending against or appearing as a third party witness in respect of, or otherwise incurred in connection with, any such loss, claim, damage, expense, liability, action, investigation or proceeding. If indemnification is
available under this Section  2.9 , the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in Section  2.9(a) and Section  2.9(b) without
regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying parties or indemnified party. 2.10 Reporting Requirements; Rule 144 . Until the
expiration or termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, HealthCare shall be and remain in compliance with the periodic filing requirements imposed under the SEC’s rules and regulations, including the Exchange Act, and any
other applicable Laws or rules, and shall timely file such information, documents and reports as the SEC may require or prescribe under Section 13 or 15(d) (whichever is applicable) of the Exchange Act. If HealthCare is not required to file
such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder, make publicly available such necessary information for so long as necessary to permit Sales pursuant to Rule 144 or Regulation S under the Securities Act, and it will take such further action as
any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to Sell Registrable Securities without Registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144

 (b) In the event of any claim, controversy, demand or request for relief of any kind arising out of, in connection with, or in relation to the
interpretation, performance, nonperformance, validity or breach of this Agreement or otherwise arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any Action based on contract, tort, equity, statute,
regulation or constitution (collectively, “ Disputes ”), the party raising the Dispute shall give written notice of the Dispute (a “ Dispute Notice ”), and the general counsels of the parties (or such other individuals
designated by the respective general counsels) or the executive officers designated by the parties shall negotiate for a reasonable period of time to settle such Dispute; provided , that such reasonable period shall not, unless otherwise
agreed by the parties in writing, exceed ninety (90) days (the “ Negotiation Period ”) from the time of receipt 
   25
of the Dispute Notice; provided , further , that in the event of any arbitration in accordance with Section  4.4(c) , the parties shall not assert the defenses
of statute of limitations, laches and any other defense, in each such case based on the passage of time during the Negotiation Period, and any contractual time period or deadline under this Agreement relating to such Dispute occurring after the
Dispute Notice is received shall not be deemed to have passed until such arbitration has been resolved. (c) If the Dispute has not been
resolved for any reason after the Negotiation Period, such Dispute may be submitted by either party to final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect (the
“ Rules ”), except as provided in Section  4.5 or as otherwise modified herein. (i) The
arbitration shall, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a schedule to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, be conducted using a single arbitrator selected from the list set forth on, and in accordance with the provisions of, such
schedule. (ii) If none of the arbitrators listed on and selected in accordance with the schedule to the Separation and Distribution
Agreement referred to in Section  4.4(c)(i) is available or willing to serve, then the arbitration shall be conducted by a three-member arbitral tribunal (such three-member arbitral tribunal or single arbitrator selected
pursuant to Section  4.4(c)(i) , as applicable, the “ Arbitral Tribunal ”). In this event, the claimant shall nominate one arbitrator in accordance with the Rules, and the respondent shall nominate one
arbitrator in accordance with the Rules within twenty-one (21) days after the appointment of the first arbitrator. The third arbitrator, who shall serve as chair of the Arbitral Tribunal, shall be jointly
nominated by the two party-nominated arbitrators within twenty-one (21) days after the confirmation of the appointment of the second arbitrator or such additional period as may be mutually agreed. If any
arbitrator is not appointed within the time limit provided herein, such arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS in accordance with the listing, striking and ranking procedure in the Rules. 
 (iii) The arbitration shall be held, and the award shall be rendered, in New York, New York, in the English language. 
 (iv) For the avoidance of doubt, by submitting their Dispute to arbitration under the Rules, the parties expressly agree that all issues of
arbitrability, including all issues concerning the propriety and timeliness of the commencement of the arbitration, the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal (including the scope of this agreement to arbitrate and the extent to which a Dispute is
within that scope), and the procedural conditions for arbitration, shall be finally and solely determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. (v)
Without derogating from Section  4.4(c)(vi) below, the Arbitral Tribunal shall have the full authority to grant any pre-arbitral injunction,
 pre-arbitral attachment, interim or conservatory measure or other order in aid of arbitration proceedings (“ Interim Relief ”). The parties shall exclusively submit any application for Interim
Relief to only: (A) the Arbitral Tribunal; or (B) prior to the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, an emergency arbitrator appointed in the manner provided for in the Rules (the “ Emergency Arbitrator ”). Any
 
   26
Interim Relief so issued shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be deemed a final arbitration award for purposes of enforceability, and, moreover, shall also be deemed a term and
condition of this Agreement subject to specific performance in Section  4.5 below. The foregoing procedures shall constitute the exclusive means of seeking Interim Relief, provided , however , that (i) the
Arbitral Tribunal shall have the power to continue, review, vacate or modify any Interim Relief granted by an Emergency Arbitrator; and (ii) in the event an Emergency Arbitrator or the Arbitral Tribunal issues an order granting, denying or
otherwise addressing Interim Relief (a “ Decision on Interim Relief ”), any party may apply to enforce or require specific performance of such Decision on Interim Relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
 (vi) The Arbitral Tribunal shall have the power to grant any remedy or relief that is in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
including specific performance and temporary or final injunctive relief, provided , however , that the Arbitral Tribunal shall have no authority or power to limit, expand, alter, amend, modify, revoke or suspend any condition or
provision of this Agreement, nor any right or power to award punitive, exemplary, enhanced or treble damages. (vii) The Arbitral
Tribunal shall have the power to allocate the costs and fees of the arbitration, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses and costs as well as those costs and fees addressed in the Rules, between the parties in the manner it deems fit.
 (viii) Arbitration under this Section  4.4 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any Dispute, and any
award rendered thereby shall be final and binding upon the parties as from the date rendered. Judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal may be entered in any state or federal court within the State of Delaware (which the parties hereby
agree have jurisdiction over them to enforce any such award) and any other court having jurisdiction thereof, including any court having jurisdiction over the relevant Party or its Assets. 
 4.5 Specific Performance . Subject to Section  4.4(b) and Section  4.4(c) , except as
provided below, in the event of any actual or threatened default in, or breach of, any of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement, the affected party shall have the right to specific performance, declaratory relief and injunctive or
other equitable relief (on a permanent, emergency, temporary, preliminary or interim basis) of its rights under this Agreement, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies at Law or in equity, and all such rights and remedies shall be
cumulative. The other party shall not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that money damages are an adequate remedy. The parties agree that the remedies at Law for any breach or threatened breach hereof, including monetary damages, are
inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate is hereby waived. Any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond or similar security with such remedy
are hereby waived. For the avoidance of doubt, the rights pursuant to this Section  4.5 shall be pursued in arbitration under Section  4.4(c) . 
   27
4.6 Venue for Injunctive Relief and Specific Performance Claims . Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Section  4.4(b) and Section  4.4(c) ), an affected party may bring any claim for specific performance, declaratory
relief and injunctive or other equitable relief (on a permanent, emergency, temporary, preliminary or interim basis) under Section  4.5 of this Agreement (a “ Chosen Court Claim ”) either (a) pursuant to
the procedures contained in Section  4.4(b) and Section  4.4(c); or (b) at the affected party’s sole discretion, in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
shall be unavailable, any Delaware State court or the federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) (the “ Chosen Courts ”). The parties irrevocably consent and agree, on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates, to the
jurisdiction, forum and venue of the Chosen Courts for a Chosen Court Claim, and agree that they shall not assert, and shall hereby waive, any claim or right or defense that they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, that the
venue is improper, that the forum is inconvenient, that the Chosen Court Claim should instead be arbitrated by their agreement or operation of law, or any similar objection, claim or argument. 
 4.7 Headings . The article, section and paragraph headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 4.8 Severability . If any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any Person or circumstance is determined by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof, or the application of such provision to Persons or
circumstances, or in jurisdictions other than those as to which it has been held invalid or unenforceable, shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either party. Upon any such determination, any such provision, to the extent determined to be invalid, void or unenforceable, shall be deemed
replaced by a provision that such arbitrator or court determines is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, void or unenforceable provision. 
 4.9 Amendment; Waiver . 
 (a) This Agreement may not be amended or modified and waivers and consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, except
by an instrument or instruments in writing making specific reference to this Agreement and signed by HealthCare and the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities; provided that if GE or any of its Affiliates owns Registrable
Securities, no amendment to or waiver of any provision in this Agreement will be effected without the written consent of GE if such amendment or waiver adversely affects (in whole or in part) any rights of GE or such Affiliates of GE. 
 (b) No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of any party, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver hereof or thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
 
   28
4.10 Registrations, Exchanges, etc. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may
be contained in this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the full extent set forth herein with respect to (a) any shares of HealthCare Common Stock, now or hereafter authorized to be issued, (b) any and all
securities of HealthCare into which the shares of HealthCare Common Stock are converted, exchanged or substituted in any recapitalization or other capital reorganization by HealthCare and (c) any and all securities of any kind whatsoever of
HealthCare or any successor or permitted assign of HealthCare (whether by merger, consolidation, Sale of assets or otherwise) which may be issued on or after the date hereof in respect of, in conversion of, in exchange for or in substitution of, the
shares of HealthCare Common Stock, and shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividends, or other distributions, stock splits or reverse stock splits, combinations, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations, exchange offers or other
reorganizations occurring after the date hereof. 4.11 Further Assurances . In addition to the actions specifically provided for
elsewhere in this Agreement, but subject to the express limitations of this Agreement, each of the parties shall use reasonable best efforts, prior to, on and after the Distribution, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and agreements to consummate, and make effective, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 
 4.12 Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which counterparts shall be considered one and
the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile or PDF signature and scanned and exchanged by electronic mail,
