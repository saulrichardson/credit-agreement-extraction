⟦s001348⟧ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, solely to the extent that: (i) a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines that the calculation or determination of interest payable by Canadian Borrowers in respect of the Obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be governed by the Canadian laws of any province of Canada and the federal laws of Canada; or (ii) the Interest Act (Canada) otherwise applies: (a) whenever interest payable by Canadian Borrowers is calculated on the basis of a period which is less than the actual number of days in a calendar year, each rate of interest determined pursuant to such calculation is, for the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), equivalent to such rate multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which such rate is to be ascertained and divided by the number of days used as the basis of such calculation; (b) in no event shall the aggregate “interest” (as defined in Section 347 of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c.

⟦s001350⟧ Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all such adjustments, if Agent or any Lender shall have received an amount in excess of the maximum permitted by the Criminal Code Section, then Canadian Borrowers shall be entitled, by notice in writing to the Agent or affected Lender, to obtain reimbursement from Agent or that Lender in an amount equal to such excess.
⟦s001351⟧ For the purposes of this Agreement and each other Loan Document to which any Canadian Borrower is a party, the effective annual rate of interest payable by Canadian Borrowers shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and principles over the term of the loans on the basis of annual compounding for the lawfully permitted rate of interest and, in the event of dispute, a certificate of a Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries appointed by Agent for the account of Canadian Borrowers will be conclusive for the purpose of such determination in the absence of evidence to the contrary; (c) all calculations of interest payable by Canadian Borrowers under this Agreement or any other Loan Document are to be made on the basis of the nominal interest rate described herein and therein and not on the basis of effective yearly rates or on any other basis which gives effect to the principle of deemed reinvestment of interest.
⟦s001352⟧ The parties acknowledge that there is a material difference between the stated nominal interest rates and the effective yearly rates of interest and that they are capable of making the calculations required to determine such effective yearly rates of interest; and -142-

⟦s002016⟧ In addition, Agent and each Lender shall have the right to periodically conduct due diligence on all Loan Parties, their senior management and key principals and legal and beneficial owners.
⟦s002017⟧ Each Loan Party agrees to cooperate in respect of the conduct of such due diligence and further agrees that the reasonable costs and charges for any such due diligence by Agent shall constitute Lender Group Expenses hereunder and be for the account of Borrowers.
⟦s002018⟧ (b) Each Loan Party acknowledges that, pursuant to the provisions of Canadian Anti-Money Laundering & Anti-Terrorism Legislation, Agent and Lenders may be required to obtain, verify and record information regarding each Loan Party, its respective directors, authorized signing officers, direct or indirect shareholders or other Persons in control of such Loan Party, and the transactions contemplated hereby.
⟦s002019⟧ The Loan Parties shall promptly provide all such information, including supporting documentation and other evidence, as may be reasonably requested by any Lender or Agent, or any prospective assign or participant of a Lender or Agent, necessary in order to comply with any applicable Canadian Anti-Money Laundering & Anti-Terrorism Legislation, whether now or hereafter in existence.
⟦s002020⟧ If Agent has ascertained the identity of any Loan Party or any authorized signatories of any Loan Party for the purposes of applicable Canadian Anti-Money Laundering & Anti-Terrorism Legislation, then Agent: (i) shall be deemed to have done so as an agent for each Lender, and this Agreement shall constitute a “written agreement” in such regard between each Lender and Agent within the meaning of applicable Canadian Anti-Money Laundering & Anti-Terrorism Legislation; (ii) shall provide to each Lender copies of all information obtained in such regard without any representation or warranty as to its accuracy or completeness.

⟦s002022⟧ 17.12.
⟦s002023⟧ Integration .
⟦s002024⟧ This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, reflects the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be contradicted or qualified by any other agreement, oral or written, before the date hereof.
⟦s002025⟧ The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, all Bank Product Agreements, if any, are independent agreements governed by the written provisions of such Bank Product Agreements, which will remain in full force and effect, unaffected by any repayment, prepayments, acceleration, reduction, increase, or change in the terms of any credit extended hereunder, except as otherwise expressly provided in such Bank Product Agreement.

⟦s002030⟧ Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Borrower (a) to provide Agent with all notices with respect to Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit obtained for the benefit of any Borrower and all other notices and instructions under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (and any notice or instruction provided by Administrative Borrower shall be deemed to be given by Borrowers hereunder and shall bind each Borrower), (b) to receive notices and instructions from members of the Lender Group (and any notice or instruction provided by any member of the Lender Group to the Administrative Borrower in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been given to each Borrower), and (c) to take such action as the Administrative Borrower deems appropriate on its behalf to obtain Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit and to exercise such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
⟦s002031⟧ It is understood that the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral in a combined fashion, as more fully set forth herein, is done solely as an accommodation to Borrowers in order to utilize the collective borrowing powers of Borrowers in the most efficient and economical manner and at their request, and that Lender Group shall not incur liability to any Borrower as a result hereof.
⟦s002032⟧ Each Borrower expects to derive benefit, directly or indirectly, from the handling of the Loan Account and the Collateral in a combined fashion since the successful operation of each Borrower is dependent on the continued successful performance of the integrated group.
⟦s002033⟧ To induce the Lender Group to do so, and in consideration thereof, each Borrower hereby jointly and severally agrees to indemnify each member of the Lender Group and hold each member of the Lender Group harmless against any and all liability, expense, loss or claim of damage or injury, made against the Lender Group by any Borrower or by any third party whosoever, arising from or incurred by reason of (i) the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral of Borrowers as herein provided, or (ii) the Lender Group’s relying on any instructions of the Administrative Borrower, except that Borrowers will have no liability to the relevant Agent-Related Person or Lender-Related Person under this Section 17.13 with respect to any liability that has been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent-Related Person or Lender-Related Person, as the case may be.

⟦s002035⟧ Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions .
⟦s002036⟧ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and -199-
⟦s002037⟧ (b) the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable: (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.
⟦s002038⟧ 17.15.
⟦s002039⟧ Judgment Currency .
⟦s002040⟧ If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.
⟦s002041⟧ The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “ Judgment Currency ”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the “ Agreement Currency ”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency.
⟦s002042⟧ If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to Agent or any Lender from any Borrower in the Agreement Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss.
⟦s002043⟧ If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to Agent or any Lender in such currency, Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to such Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).
⟦s002044⟧ 17.16.
⟦s002045⟧ No Setoff .

⟦s002050⟧ Swing Loans) and participations in Swing Loans and Letters of Credit, such that in lieu of the interest of each Lender in each Loan and Letter of Credit in which it shall participate as of such date (including such Lender’s interest in the Obligations of each Borrower in respect of each such Loan and Letter of Credit), such Lender shall hold an interest in every one of the Loans (other than the Swing Loans), and a participation in every one of the Swing Loans and Letters of Credit (including the Obligations of each Borrower in respect of each such Loan), whether or not such Lender shall previously have participated therein, equal to such Lender’s CAM Percentage thereof and (iv) simultaneously with the deemed exchange of interests pursuant to clause (iii) above, all outstanding Revolving Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars shall, automatically and with no further action required, be converted into Dollars, determined using the exchange rate calculated as of the Business Day immediately preceding the CAM Exchange Date, and (x) on and after such date all such Loans shall constitute Loans payable in Dollars and (y) all amounts payable by any Lender hereunder with respect to its participation in Letters of Credit shall be payable to the Agent in Dollars.
⟦s002051⟧ Each Lender and each Borrower hereby consents and agrees to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees that the CAM Exchange shall be binding upon its successors and assigns and any Person that acquires a participation in its interests in any Loan or any participation in any Swing Loan or Letter of Credit.
⟦s002052⟧ Each Borrower agrees from time to time to execute and deliver to the Agent all such promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the Agent shall reasonably request to evidence and confirm the respective interests of the Lenders after giving effect to the CAM Exchange, and each Lender agrees to surrender any promissory notes originally received by it in connection with its Loans hereunder to the Agent against delivery of any promissory notes evidencing its interests in the Loans so executed and delivered; provided that the failure of any Borrower to execute or deliver or of any Lender to accept any such promissory note, instrument or document shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of the CAM Exchange.
⟦s002053⟧ (b) As a result of the CAM Exchange, upon and after the CAM Exchange Date, each payment received by the Agent pursuant to any Loan Document in respect of the Obligations shall be distributed to the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective CAM Percentages, in accordance with Section 2.4(b)(ii) .
⟦s002054⟧ Any direct payment received by a Lender on or after the CAM Exchange Date, including by way of setoff, in respect of an Obligation shall be paid over to an Agent for distribution to the Lenders in accordance herewith.
⟦s002055⟧ 17.18.
⟦s002056⟧ Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs .
⟦s002057⟧ To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Hedge Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “ QFC Credit Support ” and each such QFC a “ Supported QFC ”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “ U.S. Special Resolution Regimes ”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States).
⟦s002058⟧ In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “ Covered Party ”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will -201-
⟦s002059⟧ be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
⟦s002060⟧ In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
⟦s002061⟧ Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
⟦s002062⟧ 17.19.
⟦s002063⟧ Erroneous Payments .
⟦s002064⟧ (a) Each Lender, each Issuing Bank, each other Bank Product Provider and any other party hereto hereby severally agrees that if (i) the Agent notifies (which such notice shall be conclusive absent manifest error) such Lender or Issuing Bank or any Bank Product Provider (or the Lender which is an Affiliate of a Lender, Issuing Bank or Bank Product Provider) or any other Person that has received funds from the Agent or any of its Affiliates, either for its own account or on behalf of a Lender, Issuing Bank or Bank Product Provider (each such recipient, a “ Payment Recipient ”) that the Agent has determined in its sole discretion that any funds received by such Payment Recipient were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Payment Recipient) or (ii) any Payment Recipient receives any payment from the Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, as applicable, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, as applicable, or (z) that such Payment Recipient otherwise becomes aware was transmitted or received in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) then, in each case, an error in payment shall be presumed to have been made (any such amounts specified in clauses (i) or (ii) of this Section 17.19(a) , whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise; individually and collectively, an “ Erroneous Payment ”, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, amounts received by the Agent from a Loan Party as repayment of the Obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall not be treated as an Erroneous Payment), then, in each case, such Payment Recipient is deemed to have knowledge of such error at the time of its receipt of such Erroneous Payment; provided that nothing in this Section shall require the Agent to provide any of the notices specified in clauses (i) or (ii) above.
⟦s002065⟧ Each Payment Recipient agrees that it shall not assert any right or claim to any Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payments, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine.
⟦s002066⟧ -202-
⟦s002067⟧ (b) Without limiting the immediately preceding clause (a), each Payment Recipient agrees that, in the case of clause (a)(ii) above, it shall promptly notify the Agent in writing of such occurrence.
⟦s002068⟧ (c) In the case of either clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of the Agent and shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of the Agent, and upon demand from the Agent such Payment Recipient shall (or, shall cause any Person who received any portion of an Erroneous Payment on its behalf to), promptly, but in all events no later than one Business Day thereafter, return to the Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day funds and in the currency so received, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Agent at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect.
⟦s002069⟧ (d) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by the Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (c), from any Lender that is a Payment Recipient or an Affiliate of a Payment Recipient (such unrecovered amount as to such Lender, an “ Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency ”), then at the sole discretion of the Agent and upon the Agent’s written notice to such Lender (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have made a cashless assignment of the full face amount of the portion of its Loans (but not its Commitments) with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the “ Erroneous Payment Impacted Loans ”) to the Agent or, at the option of the Agent, the Agent’s applicable lending affiliate (such assignee, the “ Agent Assignee ”) in an amount that is equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Loans, the “ Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment ”) plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such assigned amount, without further consent or approval of any party hereto and without any payment by the Agent Assignee as the assignee of such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment.
⟦s002070⟧ Without limitation of its rights hereunder, following the effectiveness of the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, the Agent may make a cashless reassignment to the applicable assigning Lender of any Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment at any time by written notice to the applicable assigning Lender and upon such reassignment all of the Loans assigned pursuant to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment shall be reassigned to such Lender without any requirement for payment or other consideration.
⟦s002071⟧ The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (1) any assignment contemplated in this clause (d) shall be made without any requirement for any payment or other consideration paid by the applicable assignee or received by the assignor, (2) the provisions of this clause (d) shall govern in the event of any conflict with the terms and conditions of Section 13 and (3) the Agent may reflect such assignments in the Register without further consent or action by any other Person.
⟦s002072⟧ (e) Each party hereto hereby agrees that (x) in the event an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Payment Recipient that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Agent (1) shall be subrogated to all the rights of such Payment Recipient and (2) is authorized to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Payment Recipient under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or -203-
⟦s002073⟧ distributable by the Agent to such Payment Recipient from any source, against any amount due to the Agent under this Section 17.19 or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement, (y) the receipt of an Erroneous Payment by a Payment Recipient shall not for the purpose of this Agreement be treated as a payment, prepayment, repayment, discharge or other satisfaction of any Obligations owed by the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Agent from the Borrowers or any other Loan Party for the purpose of making for a payment on the Obligations and (z) to the extent that an Erroneous Payment was in any way or at any time credited as payment or satisfaction of any of the Obligations, the Obligations or any part thereof that were so credited, and all rights of the Payment Recipient, as the case may be, shall be reinstated and continue in full force and effect as if such payment or satisfaction had never been received.
⟦s002074⟧ (f) Each party’s obligations under this Section 17.19 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any transfer of right or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.
⟦s002075⟧ (g) The provisions of this Section 17.19 to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) nothing in this Section 17.19 will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from any Payment Recipient’s receipt of an Erroneous Payment and (ii) there will only be deemed to be a recovery of the Erroneous Payment to the extent that Agent has received payment from the Payment Recipient in immediately available funds the Erroneous Payment Return, whether directly from the Payment Recipient, as a result of the exercise by Agent of its rights of subrogation or set off as set forth above in clause (e) or as a result of the receipt by Agent Assignee of a payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Loans assigned to Agent Assignee pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, but excluding any other amounts in respect thereof (it being agreed that any payments of interest, fees, expenses or other amounts (other than principal) received by Agent Assignee in respect of the Loans assigned to Agent Assignee pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment shall be the sole property of the Agent Assignee and shall not constitute a recovery of the Erroneous Payment).
⟦s002076⟧ (h) Nothing in this Section 17.19 will create any additional or incremental Obligation (including any indemnities or contingent Obligation) for the Loan Parties.
