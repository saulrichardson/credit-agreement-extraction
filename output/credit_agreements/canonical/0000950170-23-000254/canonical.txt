80
or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;

81
(b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit .
(i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Company delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day), (B) the amount and currency thereof (which shall be in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) and the Tranche (which shall be a Letter of Credit Tranche) under which such Letter of Credit shall be issued, (C) the expiry date thereof, (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof, (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder, (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder, (G) the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit and (H) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended, (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day), (C) the nature of the proposed amendment, and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. Additionally, the Company shall furnish to the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent may reasonably require.
(ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application from the Company and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Revolving Loan Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue the applicable Letter of Credit for the account of the Company (or the applicable Subsidiary) or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer’s usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Loan Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably
82
and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Loan Lender’s Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit.
(iii) If the Company so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an “ Auto-Extension Letter of Credit ”); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the “ Non-Extension Notice Date ”) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. The Company shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Loan Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date (or such later date if the Company provides Cash Collateral in accordance with Section 2.17 ); provided , however , that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.04(a ) or otherwise) or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Loan Lender or the Company that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.
(iv) If the Company so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that permits the automatic reinstatement of all or a portion of the stated amount thereof after any drawing thereunder (each, an “ Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit ”). Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Company shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer to permit such reinstatement. Once an Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit has been issued, except as provided in the following sentence, the Revolving Loan Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to reinstate all or a portion of the stated amount thereof in accordance with the provisions of such Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit permits the L/C Issuer to decline to reinstate all or any portion of the stated amount thereof after a drawing thereunder by giving notice of such non-reinstatement within a specified number of days after such drawing (the “ Non-Reinstatement Deadline ”), the L/C Issuer shall not permit such reinstatement if it has received a notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-Reinstatement Deadline from the Administrative Agent, any
83
Revolving Loan Lender or the Company that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied (treating such reinstatement as an L/C Credit Extension for purposes of this clause) and, in each case, directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such reinstatement.
(v) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.
(c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations .
(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Company, the Revolving Loan Lenders and the Administrative Agent thereof. In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Company shall reimburse the L/C Issuer in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Company of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an “ Honor Date ”), the Company shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing in Dollars. If the Company does not reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Loan Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) (the “ Unreimbursed Amount ”), and the amount of such Revolving Loan Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, the Company shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a Revolving Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.04(c)(i ) may be given by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such a prompt confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.
(ii) Each Revolving Loan Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i ) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the L/C Issuer in Dollars at the Administrative Agent’s Office for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Honor Date, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section
84
2.04(c)(iii ), each Revolving Loan Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Revolving Loan to the Company in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.
(iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not (x) fully refinanced by a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason or (y) otherwise reimbursed by the Company on the Honor Date, the Company shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and, subject to Section 2.09(b ), shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Revolving Loan Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(ii ) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Revolving Loan Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.04 .
(iv) Until each Revolving Loan Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Revolving Loan Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.
(v) Each Revolving Loan Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.04(c) , shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Loan Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Company or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided , however , that each Revolving Loan Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c ) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Company of a Revolving Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Company to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.
(vi) If any Revolving Loan Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Revolving Loan Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c ) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(ii ), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Loan Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such
85
payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Loan Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Loan Lender’s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Revolving Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be.

The Company hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided , however , that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Company’s pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Loan Lender, any of their respective Related Parties or any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.04(e ); provided , however , that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Company, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Company which the Company proves were caused by the L/C Issuer’s willful misconduct or gross negligence (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment) or the L/C Issuer’s willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Canadian Dollar Swing Line Lender.
(B) If for any reason any Canadian Dollar Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.05(c)(iii)(A ), the request for Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loans submitted by the Canadian Dollar Swing Line Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Canadian Dollar Swing Line Lender that each of the Alternative Currency Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Canadian Dollar Swing Line Loan and each Lender’s payment

to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(iii)(A ) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.

Except with respect to Alternative Daily Rate Loans and Alternative Term Rate Loans, all other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365- or 366-day year), or, in the case of interest in respect of Revolving Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.13(a) , bear interest for one day.

2.12. Evidence of Debt .
(a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrowers and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records
106
maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records.

Promptly following the termination of this Agreement, each Lender shall return to the Borrower each Note issued to it, or in the case of any loss, theft or destruction of any such Note, a lost note affidavit in customary form.
(b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the obligations of such Lender in respect of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency or Supplemental Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the amount of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in such Alternative Currency or Supplemental Currency and in Same Day Funds. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency or Supplemental Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars or an Alternative Currency or the time specified by the Administrative Agent in writing in the case of payments made in a Supplemental Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to
107
accrue. If any payment to be made by such Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
(b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender (A) in the case of any Revolving Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, prior to the proposed date of such Revolving Borrowing or (B) in the case of any Revolving Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans, Term A-1 Loan Borrowing or Term A-2 Loan Borrowing, prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of such Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Revolving Borrowing, Term A-1 Loan Borrowing or Term A-2 Loan Borrowing, as applicable, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with, or with and at the time required by, Section 2.02 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Revolving Borrowing, Term A-1 Loan Borrowing or Term A-2 Loan Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the applicable Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If such Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Revolving Borrowing, Term A-1 Loan Borrowing or Term A-2 Loan Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Loan, Term A-1 Loan or Term A-2 Loan included in such Revolving Borrowing, such Term A-1 Loan Borrowing or such Term A-2 Loan Borrowing, as applicable, as of the date of such Revolving Borrowing, Term A-1 Loan Borrowing or Term A-2 Loan Borrowing, as applicable. Any payment by such Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
(ii) Payments by Borrowers; Presumptions by Administrative Agent .
(A) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may
108
be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.
(B) With respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the “ Rescindable Amount ”): (1) the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment; (2) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by such Borrower (whether or not then owed); or (3) the Administrative agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment; then each of the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuers, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on written demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or a Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds are not made available to the applicable Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
(d) Obligations of Lenders Several . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Revolving Loans, to make Term A-1 Loans, to make Term A-2 Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan, any Term A-1 Loan, any Term A-2 Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Revolving
109
Loan, to make its Term A-1 Loan, to make its Term A-2 Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c) .

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies and Supplemental Currencies will automatically, on the date of such Event of Default, be converted on a notional basis into the Dollar Equivalent thereof solely for the purposes of making any allocations required under Section 8.03 and Section 2.14(b) .
2.14. Sharing of Payments by Lenders . (a) Sharing of Payments . Except as otherwise set forth herein, if, in connection with any particular Tranche or Class, any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Revolving Loans, Term A-1 Loans or Term A-2 Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it resulting in such Lender’s receiving payment with respect to such Tranche or Class of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Revolving Loans, Term A-1 Loans or Term A-2 Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof with respect to such Tranche or Class as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (i) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact and (ii) purchase (for cash at face value) from Lenders of such Tranche or Class participations in the Revolving Loans, Term A-1 Loans or Term A-2 Loans of such Tranche or Class and subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of such Tranche or Class of the other Lenders of such Tranche or Class, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Tranche or Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, Term A-1 Loans or Term A-2 Loans of such Tranche or Class and other amounts owing them in respect of such Tranche or Class; provided that:

110
or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(b) Pro Rata Sharing Following Event of Default . Notwithstanding Section 2.14(a) , following the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default and the notional conversion of all Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency or a Supplemental Currency into Dollars pursuant to Section 2.13(f) , if any Lender shall obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set off, or otherwise, other than as a result of an assignment pursuant to Section 10.06 ) (i) on account of Obligations due and payable to such Lender under the Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (A) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (B) the aggregate amount of the Obligations due and payable to all Lenders under the Loan Documents at such time) of payments obtained by all of the Lenders at such time on account of the Obligations due and payable to all Lenders under the Loan Documents at such time or (ii) on account of Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender under the Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (A) the amount of such Obligations owing to such Lender at such time to (B) the aggregate amount of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders under the Loan Documents at such time) of payments obtained by all of the Lenders at such time on account of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders under the Loan Documents at such time, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lender such interests or participating interests in the Obligations due and payable or owing to them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided , however , that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each other Lender shall be rescinded and such other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (A) the purchase price paid to such Lender to (B) the aggregate purchase price paid to all Lenders) of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of (A) the amount of such other Lender’s required repayment to (B) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered.
Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

116
that Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Company, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; sixth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Company as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Company against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth , to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Borrowings in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or L/C Borrowings were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Borrowings owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Borrowings owed to, that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.18(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

(iv) Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure . During any period in which there is a Defaulting Lender, for purposes of computing the amount of the obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Line Loans pursuant to Sections 2.04 and 2.05 , the “Applicable Percentage” of each non-Defaulting Lender shall be computed without giving effect to the Commitment of
117
that Defaulting Lender; provided that (i) each such reallocation shall be given effect only if, at the date the applicable Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, no Default or Event of Default exists; and (ii) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Lender to acquire, refinance or fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans shall not exceed the positive difference, if any, of (1) the Commitment of that non-Defaulting Lender minus (2) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of that Lender. Subject to Section 10.23 , no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.

The Reallocation Notice shall (x) specify (1) the proposed aggregate amount of such Reallocation (the “ Total Reallocation Amount ”), (2) the Tranche or Tranches being increased (each, an “ Increasing Tranche ”), (3) the Tranche or Tranches being decreased (each, a “ Decreasing Tranche ”) and (4) the proposed Reallocation Date and (y) contain a certification signed by a Responsible Officer of the Company stating that all of the requirements set forth in this Section 2.20(a) have been satisfied or, as of the Reallocation Date, will be satisfied.
(b) Upon receipt of any Reallocation Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy of such Reallocation Notice to each L/C Issuer and each affected Lender and notify each affected Lender of its proposed proportionate share of (i) the Decreasing Tranche, (ii) the Increasing Tranche, (iii) the Total Reallocation Amount and (iv) the date by which Lenders (other than Approved Reallocation Lenders) with increasing Commitments in respect of the Increasing Tranche, if any, resulting from such Reallocation must commit in writing to the increase in their respective Commitments in the Increasing
120
Tranche (the “ Reallocation Commitment Date ”). Such determinations shall be made by the Administrative Agent for each Lender based on the ratio of the Commitment of such Lender in respect of the Decreasing Tranche to the total Commitments of all Lenders in respect of such Tranche; provided that (a) if the Decreasing Tranche is the Mexican Peso Tranche, any Lender with a Mexican Peso Commitment on the Closing Date and (b) with respect to any Tranche, any Lender in the Decreasing Tranche that originally had a Commitment in the Increasing Tranche that was previously reallocated to the Decreasing Tranche, shall restore its prior Commitments in the Increasing Tranche and no other Lenders shall be offered the option to participate therein. Each Lender (other than an Approved Reallocation Lender) that is willing to participate in such Commitment increase resulting from the Reallocation shall, in its sole discretion, give written notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Reallocation Commitment Date of the amount by which it is willing to increase its applicable Commitment. If any Lender (other than an Approved Reallocation Lender) shall fail to provide such notice or shall decline, in whole or in part, to commit to its allocable share of the Commitment increase in respect of the Increasing Tranche, then the Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly allocate to the Approved Reallocation Lenders in the Increasing Tranche such share in accordance with the approved allocation amounts of such Approved Reallocation Lender set forth on Schedule 2.20 and (ii) shall thereafter offer any such remaining share to the other Lenders in the Increasing Tranche that are willing to participate in such Commitment increase on a pro rata basis. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender’s sole right to approve or consent to any Reallocation shall be its right to determine whether to participate, or not to participate, in any Commitment increase in its sole discretion as provided in this Section 2.20(b) . Any determinations by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.20(b) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(c) [Intentionally Omitted].
(d) On the applicable Reallocation Date, (i) the Reallocation shall be effected by reallocating unused Commitments from the Decreasing Tranche to the Increasing Tranche on a dollar-for-dollar basis (and with respect to any Approved Reallocation Lender, without any further approval from such Approved Reallocation Lender) and (ii) to the extent Borrowings then outstanding and owed to any applicable Lender immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Reallocation shall be less than such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated immediately following the effectiveness of such Reallocation) of all Credit Extensions then outstanding that are owed to all Lenders in any affected Tranche (collectively, including any applicable Acceding Lender, the “ Reallocation Purchasing Lenders ”), in each case as applicable, then such Reallocation Purchasing Lenders, without executing an Assignment and Assumption, shall be deemed to have purchased an assignment of a pro rata portion of the Credit Extensions then outstanding and owed to each Lender that is not a Reallocation Purchasing Lender (collectively, the “ Reallocation Selling Lenders ”), in an amount sufficient such that following the effectiveness of all such assignments the Credit Extensions outstanding and owed to each Lender shall equal such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (calculated immediately following the effectiveness of the Reallocation) of all Loans then outstanding in respect of the applicable Tranche. The Administrative Agent shall calculate the net amount to be paid by each Reallocation
121
Purchasing Lender and received by each Reallocation Selling Lender in connection with the assignments effected hereunder on the Reallocation Date. Each Reallocation Purchasing Lender shall make the amount of its required payment available to the Administrative Agent, in same day funds, at the office of the Administrative Agent not later than the Reallocation Funding Deadline on the Reallocation Date. The Administrative Agent shall distribute on the Reallocation Date the proceeds of such amount to each of the Reallocation Selling Lenders entitled to receive such payments at its applicable Lending Office.
(e) [Intentionally Omitted].
(f) On the Reallocation Date, the applicable Borrower shall execute and deliver a replacement Note payable to the order of each Lender requesting the same in a principal amount equal to such Lender’s respective Commitment immediately following the effectiveness of the Reallocation. Each Lender receiving a replacement Note shall promptly return to the applicable Borrower any previously issued Note for which such replacement Note was delivered in exchange, or in the case of any loss, theft or destruction of any previously issued Note, a lost note affidavit in customary form.
(g) On the Reallocation Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders and the Borrowers, on or before the Reallocation Agent Notice Deadline, by facsimile, telex or other electronic mail communication, of the occurrence of the Reallocation to be effected on such Reallocation Date and shall promptly distribute to the Lenders and the Borrowers a copy of Schedule 2.01A hereto revised to reflect such Reallocation. The Administrative Agent shall record in the Register the relevant information with respect to each Lender on such Reallocation Date in accordance with Section 10.06(c) .
(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Reallocation of any unused Commitment of a Lender shall cause an increase in the aggregate Commitments of such Lender and its Affiliates under all Tranches. After giving effect to any Reallocation pursuant to this Section 2.20 and without limiting Section 2.16 , the maximum aggregate amount of the Alternative Currency Commitments under the Alternative Currency Tranche may not exceed $500,000,000.
2.21. Supplemental Tranches . The Company may from time to time request (each such request, a “ Supplemental Tranche Request ”) certain Lenders to provide one or more supplemental tranches for Loans in an amount of at least $10,000,000 (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may reasonably agree) per tranche in a currency (a “ Supplemental Currency ”) that is not included as an Alternative Currency Committed Foreign Currency at the time of such Supplemental Tranche Request (each such new tranche, a “ Supplemental Tranche ”); provided that Lenders providing Supplemental Tranche Commitments with respect to such Tranche shall be obligated to make Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.01(e) in Dollars, Alternative Currency Committed Foreign Currencies and the Supplemental Currency. Each Supplemental Tranche Request shall be made in the form of an addendum substantially in the form of Exhibit N (a “ Supplemental Addendum ”) and sent to the Administrative Agent and shall set forth (i) the proposed currency of such Supplemental Tranche, (ii) the proposed existing Borrower
122
or Borrowers and/or the proposed Designated Borrower or Designated Borrowers that will be the proposed Supplemental Borrower with respect to such Supplemental Tranche, (iii) the proposed interest types and rates for such Supplemental Tranche, (iv) the other matters set forth on the form of Supplemental Addendum and (v) any other specific terms of such Supplemental Tranche that the Borrowers deem necessary; provided that the maturity date of any Revolving Loan under any Supplemental Tranche shall not be later than the Maturity Date for Revolving Loans. As a condition precedent to the addition of a Supplemental Tranche to this Agreement: (i) each Lender providing a Supplemental Tranche Commitment with respect to the applicable Supplemental Tranche must be able to make Revolving Loans in the Supplemental Currency in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, (ii) each Lender providing a Supplemental Tranche Commitment with respect to such Supplemental Tranche and the Administrative Agent must execute the requested Supplemental Addendum, (iii) each of the proposed Supplemental Borrowers under such Supplemental Tranche shall be an existing Borrower or a Designated Borrower with regard to such Supplemental Tranche and each such Supplemental Borrower and each other Loan Party shall execute the Supplemental Addendum and (iv) any other documents or certificates that shall be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in connection with the addition of the Supplemental Tranche shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Subject to the provisions of Sections 2.16 and 2.20 and this Section 2.21 , each Supplemental Tranche shall be committed to by Lenders pursuant to (x) an increase in Commitments pursuant to Section 2.16 or (y) Reallocations of unused Commitments to the applicable Supplemental Tranche pursuant to Section 2.20 . No Lender shall be obligated to make a Supplemental Tranche Commitment and a Lender may agree to do so in its sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender’s sole right to approve or consent to any Supplemental Tranche Commitment shall be its right to determine whether to participate, or not to participate, in any Supplemental Tranche Commitment in its sole discretion as provided in this Section 2.21 . If a Supplemental Tranche Request is accepted in accordance with this Section 2.21 , the Administrative Agent and each applicable Borrower shall determine the effective date of such Supplemental Tranche (the “ Supplemental Tranche Effective Date ”), the final allocation of such Supplemental Tranche and any other terms of such Supplemental Tranche. The Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute a revised Schedule 2.01A to each Lender reflecting such new Supplemental Tranche and notify each Lender of the Supplemental Tranche Effective Date. Promptly after a Supplemental Tranche Request, if the Administrative Agent cannot act as the funding agent therefor, the Company shall, subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), appoint the proposed funding agent for the requested Supplemental Tranche. Each such funding agent shall (A) execute the applicable Supplemental Addendum and (B) administer the applicable Supplemental Tranche and, in connection therewith, shall have authority consistent with the authority of the Administrative Agent hereunder in respect of the Administrative Agent’s administration of the applicable Tranche or Tranches; provided , however , that no such funding agent shall be authorized to take any enforcement action unless and except to the extent expressly authorized in writing by the Administrative Agent. Each such funding agent shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.04 to the same extent as the Administrative Agent.
123
2.22. Certain Permitted Amendments .
(a) The Company may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent from time to time after the Closing Date, but not more than three times during the term of this Agreement (and with no more than one such offer outstanding at any one time), make one or more offers (each, a “ Loan Modification Offer ”) to all the Lenders or all Lenders of any Class of Loans to make one or more Permitted Amendments pursuant to procedures reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to the Company. Such notice shall set forth (i) the terms and conditions of the requested Permitted Amendment and (ii) the date on which such Permitted Amendment is requested to become effective (which shall not be less than 10 Business Days after the date of such notice, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.01 , each Permitted Amendment shall only require the consent of the Company, the Administrative Agent and those Lenders that accept the applicable Loan Modification Offer (such Lenders, the “ Accepting Lenders ”), and each Permitted Amendment shall become effective only with respect to the Loans and/or Commitments of the Accepting Lenders. In connection with any Loan Modification Offer, the Company may, at its sole option, with respect to one or more of the Lenders that are not Accepting Lenders (each, a “ Non-Accepting Lender ”) replace such Non-Accepting Lender pursuant to Section 10.13 . Upon the effectiveness of any Permitted Amendment and any assignment of any Non-Accepting Lender’s Commitments and/or Loans pursuant to Section 10.13 , subject to the payment of applicable amounts pursuant to Section 3.05 in connection therewith, the Company shall be deemed to have made such borrowings and repayments of the Revolving Loans, and the Lenders shall make such adjustments of outstanding Revolving Loans between and among them, as shall be necessary to effect the reallocation of the Commitments such that, after giving effect thereto, the Loans shall be held by the Lenders (including the Eligible Assignees as the new Lenders) ratably in accordance with their Commitments.
(b) The Company and each Accepting Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a Loan Modification Agreement and such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the acceptance of the Permitted Amendments and the terms and conditions thereof. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Loan Modification Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that, upon the effectiveness of any Loan Modification Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Permitted Amendment evidenced thereby and only with respect to the Loans and/or Commitments of the Accepting Lenders, including any amendments necessary to treat the applicable Loans and/or Commitments of the Accepting Lenders as a new “Class” or “Tranche” of loans and/or commitments hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Permitted Amendment shall become effective unless the Administrative Agent, to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, shall have received legal opinions, board resolutions, officer’s and secretary’s certificates and other documentation consistent with those delivered on the Closing Date.
124
(c) “ Permitted Amendments ” means any or all of the following: (i) an extension of the Maturity Date applicable solely to the Loans and/or Commitments of the Accepting Lenders, (ii) an increase in the interest rate with respect to the Loans and/or Commitments of the Accepting Lenders, (iii) the inclusion of additional fees to be payable to the Accepting Lenders in connection with the Permitted Amendment (including any upfront fees), (iv) such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as shall be appropriate, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent, to provide the rights and benefits of this Agreement and other Loan Documents to each new “Class” or “Tranche” of loans and/or commitments resulting therefrom, provided that payments of principal and interest on Loans (including loans of Accepting Lenders) shall continue to be shared pro rata in accordance with Section 2.14 , except that notwithstanding Section 2.14 the Loans and Commitments of the Non-Accepting Lenders may be repaid and terminated on their applicable Maturity Date, without any pro rata reduction of the commitments and repayment of loans of Accepting Lenders with a different Maturity Date and (v) such other amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as shall be appropriate, in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent, to give effect to the foregoing Permitted Amendments.
(d) This Section 2.22 shall supersede any provision in Section 10.01 to the contrary. Notwithstanding any reallocation into extending and non-extending “Classes” or “Tranches” in connection with a Permitted Amendment, all Loans to the Company under this Agreement shall rank pari-passu in right of payment.
2.23. Sustainability Adjustments .
(a) Effective Date for Pricing Adjustments . (i) Each Sustainability Margin Adjustment and each Sustainability Facility Fee Adjustment shall be effective on the applicable Sustainability Adjustment Date and (ii) each change in the Applicable Rate and the Facility Fee resulting from delivery of a Sustainability Pricing Certificate shall be effective during the period commencing on and including the applicable Sustainability Adjustment Date and ending on the earlier to occur of (x) the date immediately preceding the next such Sustainability Adjustment Date and (y) the 180 th day of the immediately succeeding fiscal year.
(b) Maximum Adjustment Amount . For the avoidance of doubt, the Sustainability Pricing Certificate may be delivered only once in respect of any fiscal year. It is further understood and agreed that (i) the Applicable Rate will never be reduced or increased by more than (A) 0.04% (4 basis points) in the case of Revolving Loans and Letter of Credit Fees and (B) 0.05% (5 basis points) in the case of Term Loans and (ii) the Facility Fee will never be reduced or increased by more than 0.01% (1 basis point), in each case pursuant to the Sustainability Margin Adjustment or the Sustainability Facility Fee Adjustment, as applicable, during any fiscal year (the “ Maximum Adjustment ”). For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustment to the Applicable Rate due to a Sustainability Margin Adjustment or any adjustment to the Facility Fee due to a Sustainability Facility Fee Adjustment in any fiscal year shall not be cumulative year-over-year. Each applicable adjustment shall only
125
apply until the date on which the next adjustment is due to take place pursuant to Section 2.23(a) above.
(c) Non-Reporting of KPI . If the Company does not provide the Administrative Agent with the Sustainability Pricing Certificate for one or more KPI Metrics for any fiscal year within the timeframe set forth Section 6.11(l) , then until such time as the Company provides such certificate for the applicable KPI Metric, the Applicable Rate shall be increased by (i) (A) 0.02% (2 basis points) in the case of Revolving Loans and Letter of Credit Fees and (B) 0.025% (2.5 basis points) in the case of Term Loans and (ii) the Facility Fee shall be increased by 0.005% (0.5 basis points), in each case, for each applicable Key Performance Indicator for which a KPI Metric has not been submitted, commencing on the day by which such Sustainability Pricing Certificate was required to have been delivered pursuant to Section 6.11(l) and continuing until the Company submits the Sustainability Pricing Certificate for such fiscal year or for the subsequent fiscal year; provided that the Applicable Rate and the Facility Fee, as applicable, shall never be increased by more than the Maximum Adjustment.
(d) Sustainability Certificate Inaccuracy . (1) If (i) (A) the Company or the Required Lenders become aware of any material inaccuracy in any Sustainability Applicable Rate Adjustment or any KPI Metric calculation as reported in a Sustainability Pricing Certificate (any such material inaccuracy, a “ Sustainability Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy ”) and, in the case of the Required Lenders, the Required Lenders deliver a written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Sustainability Structuring Agent describing such Sustainability Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy in reasonable detail (which description shall be promptly shared with each Lender and the Company), or (B) the Company and the Lenders agree that there was a Sustainability Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy at the time of delivery of a Sustainability Pricing Certificate, and (ii) a proper calculation of the Sustainability Applicable Rate Adjustments or the KPI Metrics would have resulted in an increase in the Applicable Rate and/or Facility Fee for any applicable period, the Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders promptly following written demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Company under the Bankruptcy Code, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent or any Lender), but in any event within 10 Business Days after the Company has received written notice in reasonable detail of, or has agreed in writing that there was, a Sustainability Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy, an amount equal to the excess of (1) the amount of interest or fee, as applicable, in each case that should have been paid for such period over (2) the amount of interest or fee actually paid for such period.
(2) If the Company becomes aware of any Sustainability Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy and, in connection therewith, if a proper calculation of the Sustainability Applicable Rate Adjustment or the KPI Metrics would have resulted in a decrease in the Applicable Rate or Facility Fee for any period, then, upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of written notice from the Company of such Sustainability Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy (which notice shall include corrections to the calculations of the Sustainability Applicable Rate Adjustment or the KPI Metrics, as applicable, and be certified to by a
126
Responsible Officer of the Company), commencing on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, the Applicable Rate or the Facility Fee, as applicable, shall be adjusted to reflect the corrected calculations of the Sustainability Applicable Rate Adjustment or the KPI Metrics, as applicable.
(3) It is understood and agreed that any Sustainability Pricing Certificate Inaccuracy with respect to any applicable period shall not constitute a Default unless the Company fails to make a payment required by the foregoing terms of this Section 2.23(d) within the time period for payment set forth in clause (1) of this Section 2.23(d) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless such amounts shall be due upon the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Company under the Bankruptcy Code, (a) any additional amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.23(d) shall not be due and payable until a written demand is made for such payment by the Administrative Agent in accordance with clause (1) of this Section 2.23(d) , (b) any nonpayment of such additional amounts shall not constitute a Default (whether retroactively or otherwise) until the expiration of the period for payment set forth in clause (1) of this Section 2.23 and (c) none of such additional amounts shall be deemed overdue prior to such a demand or shall accrue interest at the Default Rate prior to the expiration of the period for payment set forth in clause (1) of this Section 2.23 .
(e) Agent Exculpation . Each party hereto hereby agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor the Sustainability Structuring Agent shall have any responsibility for (or liability in respect of) reviewing, auditing or otherwise evaluating any calculation by the Company of any Sustainability Applicable Rate Adjustment (or any of the data or computations that are part of or related to any such calculation) set forth in the Initial KPI Metrics Report, any KPI Metrics Report or any Sustainability Pricing Certificate (and the Administrative Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry).
(f) Regulatory Change; Sustainability Recalculation Event . In the event of a Regulatory Change or a Sustainability Recalculation Event, in each case, which affects, significantly, whether positively and / or negatively, one or more of the KPI Metrics, (i) the Company, the Administrative Agent and the Sustainability Structuring Agent shall negotiate in good faith, by no later than 60 days following such Regulatory Change or Sustainability Recalculation Event, as applicable, any necessary amendment, modification or other supplement to Schedule 2.23 (and any component definitions thereof), which amendment, modification or other supplement shall be subject to the affirmative approval of the Required Lenders; provided , however , if the Company, the Sustainability Structuring Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders are unable to agree to any such amendment, modification or supplement following the 60 day period, the Sustainability Applicable Rate Adjustment shall cease to apply for the relevant Key Performance Indicator and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for all purposes hereunder, the Sustainability Applicable Rate Adjustment for such Key Performance Indicator shall be deemed to be zero. In the case such Key Performance Indicator no longer applies, the Company will then cease to refer to the applicable Key Performance Indicator in the Sustainability Pricing Certificate.
127

(a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes . (i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the respective Loan Parties hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent permitted by applicable Laws be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. If, however, applicable Laws require any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such Laws as determined in the good faith discretion of such Loan Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below.
(ii) If any Loan Party or the Administrative Agent shall be required by applicable Law to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States federal backup withholding taxes and withholding taxes imposed by any jurisdiction, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such required withholding or the making of such required deductions (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, the applicable Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
(b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers . Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, each Loan Party shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws.
(c) Tax Indemnifications . Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Loan Party shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 30 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) withheld or deducted or payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.

(i) Each Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and to the Administrative Agent at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Laws or by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction and such other reasonably requested information as will permit the Company or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine (A) whether or not payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document are subject to Taxes (including any documentation that will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding), (B) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction and (C) such Lender’s entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender by the respective Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender’s status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section or the definition of “Excluded Taxes”, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in paragraphs (e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B)(1)-(4) and (iii) of this Section) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

(A) any Lender that is a “United States person” within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the Company on behalf of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; and
129
(B) each Foreign Lender that is entitled under the Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Company on behalf of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
(1) executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,
(2) executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,
(3) executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY and all required supporting documentation,
(4) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of such Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, or
(5) executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws to permit such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
(iii) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed in law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the
130
Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company or the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 3.01(e)(iii) and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the definition of “FATCA” or Section 1.02 , "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Closing Date.
(iv) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certificate or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds . Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and net of any loss or gain realized in the conversion of such funds from or to another currency incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that each Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer be required to pay any amount to a Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (f) the payment of which would place the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer (as applicable) in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Administrative Agent, any Lender or L/C Issuer would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
(g) Grandfathered Obligations . For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from and after the Closing Date, the Borrowers and the
131
Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) the Loans as not qualifying as a “grandfathered obligation” within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).
3.02. Illegality . If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office or Affiliate to make, maintain or fund Loans (a) to any Designated Borrower or (b) whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate, SOFR or Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, SOFR or Term SOFR, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue (A) any Loan to such Designated Borrower or (B) Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies, Daily Simple SOFR Loans or Term SOFR Loans, to convert Base Rate Revolving Loans or Base Rate Term Loans to Term SOFR Revolving Loans, Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loans, Daily Simple SOFR Loans or Term SOFR Term Loans, as applicable, shall be suspended and, in the case of any notice delivered pursuant to clause (a) above, such Lender shall be under no obligation to make additional Loans to such Designated Borrower and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of any notice pursuant to clause (b) above, (x) the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars or such Lender is an Alternative Currency Lender or U.S. Dollar Lender, convert all Term SOFR Loans, Daily Simple SOFR Loans and all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either (I) on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, in the case of Term SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans or such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or (II) immediately, in the case of Term SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans or such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate or SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based SOFR. Upon receipt of any notice pursuant to clause (a) above, which notice asserts the illegality of such Lender to lend to such Designated Borrower, the Borrowers shall prepay such Loans of such Lender outstanding to such Designated Borrower within ten (10) Business Days of such notice (or such shorter period as required by applicable Law); provided that if such Loans are not so repaid, so long as no Event of Default has
132
occurred and is continuing and the Company has designated another Borrower to which it is not illegal for such Lender to make or maintain Loans, such Loans shall be deemed to be repaid and such other Borrower as designated by the Company shall be deemed to have borrowed the amount deemed repaid by such Designated Borrower. Upon any such prepayment or conversion the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
3.03. Inability to Determine Rates .
(a) If in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Loan, a Daily Simple SOFR Loan or a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to Term SOFR Loans, Daily Simple SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans or a continuation of any of such Term SOFR Loans or such Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as applicable, (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (A) no Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 3.03(b ) or Section 3.03(c), and the circumstances under clause (i) of Section 3.03(b) or of Section 3.03(c) or the Non-SOFR Scheduled Unavailability Date or the SOFR Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred, or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining Term SOFR, Daily Simple SOFR or the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Revolving Loan, Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loan, Term SOFR Term Loan or Daily Simple SOFR Loan, as applicable, or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason that Term SOFR, Daily Simple SOFR or the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to any such proposed Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender.
Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans, Daily Simple SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as applicable, or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans, Daily Simple SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as applicable, in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, or Interest Periods related thereto), and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Lenders or the Class Required Lenders in respect of the Revolving Loans, the applicable Term A-1 Loans or Term A-2 Loans, as the case may be, until the Administrative Agent upon instruction of the Required Lenders or the Class Required Lenders in respect of the Revolving Loans, the applicable Term A-1 Loans or Term A-2 Loans, as the case may be) revokes such notice.
Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, or conversion to or continuation of, Term SOFR Revolving Loans, Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loans or Term SOFR Term Loans (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Revolving Loans, Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loans or Term SOFR Term Loans, or Interest Periods related thereto), as applicable, in the affected
133
currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Revolving Loans or Base Rate Term Loans, as applicable, in the amount specified therein (or, in the case of a request for a Borrowing of, or conversion to or continuation of, Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, denominated in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount specified therein) and (ii) (A) any outstanding Term SOFR Revolving Loans or Term SOFR Term Loans, as applicable, shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans immediately at the end of their respective applicable Interest Period and (B) any outstanding, Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loan shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Revolving Loan immediately at the end of the applicable Interest Period.
(b) Replacement of Relevant Rate or Successor Rate . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Company or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Company) that the Company or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that:
(i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining any Applicable Reference Rate (other than SOFR) for any requested Interest Period for any Permitted Currency (other than Dollars), including, without limitation, because the applicable screen page is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or
(ii) the applicable administrator of the Applicable Reference Rate (other than SOFR) for such Permitted Currency (other than Dollars) or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which all tenors of any Applicable Reference Rate (other than SOFR) or the applicable screen rate (other than the Term SOFR Screen Rate) shall or will no longer be made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of syndicated loans denominated in such Permitted Currency (other than Dollars), or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will continue to provide such tenor(s) of the Applicable Reference Rate (other than SOFR) for such Permitted Currency (other than Dollars) after such specific date (the latest date on which all tenors of the Applicable Reference Rate (other than SOFR) or the applicable screen page (other than the Term SOFR Screen Rate) are no longer available permanently or indefinitely, the “ Non-SOFR Scheduled Unavailability Date ”),
or if the events or circumstances of the type described in Sections 3.03(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the Non-SOFR Successor Rate then in effect, then, in each case, reasonably promptly after such determination by the Administrative Agent or receipt by
134
the Administrative Agent of such notice, as applicable, the Administrative Agent and the Company may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing such Applicable Reference Rate (other than SOFR) in accordance with this Section 3.03 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States in such Permitted Currency (other than Dollars) for such alternative benchmark. and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States in such Permitted Currency (other than Dollars) for such benchmark, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated (any such proposed rate and adjustments thereto, a “ Non-SOFR Successor Rate ”). Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Company unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.
(c) Replacement of Term SOFR or Successor Rate . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Company or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Company) that the Company or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that:
(i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR, including, without limitation, because the Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or
(ii) CME or any successor administrator of the Term SOFR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator with respect to its publication of Term SOFR, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of U.S. dollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will continue to provide such interest periods of Term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date on which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer available permanently or indefinitely, the “ SOFR Scheduled Unavailability Date ”),
135
or if the events or circumstances of the type described in Sections 3.03(c)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the SOFR Successor Rate then in effect, then, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the “ Term SOFR Replacement Date ”), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the SOFR Scheduled Unavailability Date, Term SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan Document with Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the “ SOFR Successor Rate ” and, collectively with the Non-SOFR Successor Rate, each, a “ Successor Rate ” ) .
If the SOFR Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment, all interest payments will be payable on a quarterly basis.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the Administrative Agent determines that Daily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date, or (ii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.03(c)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the SOFR Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Company may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing Term SOFR or any then current SOFR Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 3.03 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such alternative benchmark, and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments thereto, shall constitute a “ SOFR Successor Rate ”. Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Company unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.
For purposes of this Section 3.03(c) , those Lenders that either have not made, or do not have an obligation under this Agreement to make, the relevant Loans in Dollars shall be excluded from any determination of Required Lenders.
(d) Successor Rate . The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Company and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate.
136
Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent.
Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate (for the avoidance of doubt, after taking into account any applicable credit spread adjustment) as so determined would otherwise be less than zero, the Successor Rate (for the avoidance of doubt, after taking into any applicable credit spread adjustment) will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Company and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.
3.04. Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans .
(a) Increased Costs Generally . If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement to the extent reflected in the Eurocurrency Rate) or the L/C Issuer;
(ii) subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a Letter of Credit or any Term SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the L/C Issuer in respect thereof (except for (A) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.01 , (B) and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Tax described in clauses (c) through (e) of the definition of Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer and (C) Taxes that are imposed on or measured by net income (however denominated) or that are franchise Taxes or branch profits Taxes, in each case imposed as a result of a present or former connection between such Lender or L/C Issuer and the jurisdiction imposing such Tax (other than connections arising from such Lender or L/C Issuer having executed, delivered, become a party to, performed its obligations under, received payments under, received or perfected a security interest under, engaged in any other transaction pursuant to or enforced any Loan Document, or sold or assigned an interest in any Loan or Loan Document)); or
137
(iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the applicable offshore interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Term SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, maintaining, converting or continuing any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to Term SOFR or the Eurocurrency Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Company will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) Capital Requirements . If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Company will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) Certificates for Reimbursement . A certificate of a Lender or the L/C Issuer setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a), (b) or (e) of this Section and delivered to the Company shall be conclusive absent manifest error; provided , however , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.04 , in the case of any Change in Law, it shall be a condition to a Lender’s exercise of its rights, if any, under this Section 3.04 that such Lender shall generally be exercising similar rights with respect to borrowers under similar agreements where available. The Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt thereof.
138
(d) Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s right to demand such compensation, provided that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or the L/C Issuer’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
(e) Additional Reserve Requirements . The Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of Term SOFR Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) not already paid pursuant to Section 3.04(a) or (b) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Company shall have received at least 30 days’ prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) reasonably detailing the calculation of additional amounts due to such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 30 days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional costs shall be due and payable 30 days from receipt of such notice.
3.05. Compensation for Losses . Upon written request (which request shall set forth the basis for compensation and a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such compensation) of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Company shall promptly compensate (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to compensate) such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any reasonable loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or Absolute Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
(b) any failure by any Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert into any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or Absolute Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower;
139
(c) any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan or reimbursement of a drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency in a different currency;
(d) any assignment of a Term SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 10.13 ; or
(e) any Reallocation pursuant to Section 2.20(d) in respect of any Tranche on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period of any Term SOFR Loan or Eurocurrency Rate Loan outstanding under such Tranche;
excluding any loss of anticipated profits but including any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. The Company shall pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company (or the applicable Designated Borrower) to the Lenders under this Section 3.05 , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Base Rate used in determining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
3.06. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders .
(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04 , or any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender, the L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.01 , or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02 , then at the request of any Borrower such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04 , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02 , as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be. The Company hereby agrees to pay (or to cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b) Replacement of Lenders . If (i) any Lender or Participant requests compensation under Section 3.04 , (ii) any Borrower is required to pay any additional
140
amount to any Lender, any Participant or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or any Participant pursuant to Section 3.01 or (iii) any Lender delivers a notice pursuant to Section 3.02 , the Company may replace such Lender or such Participant in accordance with Section 10.13 .
3.07. Survival . All of the Borrowers’ obligations under this Article III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations hereunder, and resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender.

Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the “Private Side Information” or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lender’s compliance procedures and applicable Law, including United States Federal and state securities Laws, to access Borrower Materials that are not made available through the “Public Side Information” portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information with respect to any Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws.

All telephonic notices to and other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent or the Sustainability Structuring Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent and the Sustainability Structuring Agent, respectively, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.
10.03. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies; Enforcement . No failure by any Lender, the L/C Issuer, the Sustainability Structuring Agent or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 8.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders and the L/C Issuer; provided , however , that the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (b) the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender from exercising the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (c) the Sustainability Structuring Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Sustainability Structuring Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (d) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 10.08 (subject to the terms of Section 2.14 ) or (e) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Loan Party under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided , further , that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b), (d) and (e) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 2.14 , any Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders.
10.04. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver .
(a) Costs and Expenses . The Company shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the
188
Sustainability Structuring Agent and their respective Affiliates (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for each of the Administrative Agent and the Sustainability Structuring Agent, including Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP), in connection with, as applicable, the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) to the extent not already paid pursuant to Section 2.04 , all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the L/C Issuer in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder, (iii) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Structuring Agent, any Lender (following an Event of Default) or the L/C Issuer (including the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Structuring Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer), in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights (A) in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit and (iv) pay and hold each of the Lenders harmless from and against any and all present and future stamp, excise and other similar taxes with respect to the foregoing matters and save each of the Lenders harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or omission (other than to the extent attributable to such Lender) to pay such taxes. It is understood that the provisions of this clause do not include the normal administrative charges of the Administrative Agent in administering the Loans (which amounts are included in a separate letter with the Administrative Agent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation to reimburse the Lenders and the L/C Issuer for fees, charges and disbursements of counsel in connection with the matters described in clause (iii) above shall be limited to (w) one law firm for the Administrative Agent, (x) one law firm for the Sustainability Structuring Agent, (y) one other law firm retained by the Required Lenders or an ad hoc group of Lenders and (z) in the event of a conflict of interest, one additional law firm for another Lender or group of Lenders, together with (in the case of (w), (x), (y) and (z), as applicable) one additional counsel in each applicable jurisdiction.
(b) Indemnification by the Company . The Company shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, any sub-agent of the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Structuring Agent, any sub-agent of the Sustainability Structuring Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “ Indemnitee ”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel or consultants for any Indemnitee), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by any Borrower or any other Loan Party arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document
189
or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent or the Sustainability Structuring Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including in respect of any matters addressed in Section 3.01 ), (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not substantially comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Claim related in any way to any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Company or any other Loan Party, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, IN ALL CASES, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF THE COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNITEE , but excluding any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (w) to the extent incurred by reason of the Indemnitee’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as determined by a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, (x) to the extent arising from any dispute solely among Indemnitees which dispute does not directly result from an act or omission by the Borrower or any other Loan Party (other than any claims against an Indemnitee in its capacity as Administrative Agent, Sustainability Structuring Agent or Arranger or any similar role hereunder or under any other Loan Document), (y) to the extent arising from yield maintenance matters addressed in Section 3.04 or (z) that constitute amounts in respect of Excluded Taxes. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay or hold harmless the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Structuring Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public policy, the Company shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the indemnified liabilities which is permissible under applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all Indemnitees in each relevant jurisdiction (unless there shall exist an actual conflict of interest among the Indemnitees, in which case, one or more additional firms shall be permitted to the extent necessary to eliminate such conflict). The Company shall be entitled to assume the defense of any matter for which indemnification may be sought under hereunder with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitees seeking indemnification hereunder. Upon assumption by the Company of the defense of any such matter, such Indemnitees shall have the right to participate in such matter and to retain their own counsel but the Company shall not be liable for any legal expenses of other counsel subsequently incurred by such Indemnitees in connection with the defense thereof unless such Indemnitees shall have been advised by counsel that there are actual or potential conflicting interests between the Company and the Indemnitees. The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such proceeding effected without the Company’s written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
190
withheld, conditioned or delayed), but if settled with such consent or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitees from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment subject to the Company’s rights in this paragraph to claim exemption from its indemnity obligations. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of any Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which such Indemnitee is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnitee, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability or claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability, or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnitee. In the case of an investigation, litigation or proceeding to which the indemnity in this paragraph applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by the Company, its equity holders or creditors or an Indemnitee, whether or not an Indemnitee is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated. The Company also agrees that no Indemnitee shall have any liability (whether in contract or tort or otherwise) to the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates or to the Company’s or their respective equity holders or creditors arising out of, related to or in connection with any aspect of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except to the extent of damages determined in a final, nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnitee’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, and no Indemnitee shall be liable under any circumstances for any punitive damages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through electronic telecommunications or other information transmission systems, other than for damages (but not punitive damages) resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
(c) Reimbursement by Lenders . To the extent that the Company for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, any sub-agent of the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Structuring Agent, any sub-agent of the Sustainability Structuring Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent thereof), the Sustainability Structuring Agent (or any such sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, any such sub-agent or the L/C Issuer in its capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent thereof), the Sustainability Structuring Agent (or any such sub-agent thereof), or the L/C Issuer in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this
191
subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of Section 2.13(d) . To the extent that the Administrative Agent shall perform any of its duties or obligations hereunder through an Affiliate or sub-agent, then all references to the “Administrative Agent” in this Section 10.04 shall be deemed to include any such Affiliate or sub-agent, as applicable. To the extent that the Sustainability Structuring Agent shall perform any of its duties or obligations hereunder through an Affiliate or sub-agent, then all references to the “Sustainability Structuring Agent” in this Section 10.04 shall be deemed to include any such Affiliate or sub-agent, as applicable.
(d) Payments . All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than ten Business Days after demand therefor.
(e) Survival . The agreements in this Section shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Structuring Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender, the replacement of any Lender and the Facility Termination Date.
10.05. Payments Set Aside . To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof which has been distributed to or shared with the Lenders as required hereby is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and (b) each Lender and the L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, in the applicable currency of such recovery or payment. The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the Facility Termination Date.
10.06. Successors and Assigns .
(a) Successors and Assigns Generally . The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Borrower may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment, or grant of a security interest, subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
192
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b) Assignments by Lenders . Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing Line Loans) at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
(i) Minimum Amounts .
(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment and/or the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and
(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or the principal outstanding balance of the Revolving Loans (if the Commitment is not then in effect), Term A-1 Loans or Term A-2 Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided , however, that concurrent assignments to members of an Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether such minimum amount has been met.
(ii) Proportionate Amounts . Each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not (A) apply to rights in respect of Bid Loans or the Swing Line Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of Swing Line Loans or (B) prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Classes on a non-pro rata basis.
193
(iii) Required Consents . No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:
(A) the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund;
(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender;
(C) the consent of the L/C Issuer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment that increases the obligation of the assignee to participate in exposure under one or more Letters of Credit (whether or not then outstanding); and
(D) the consent of the Swing Line Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any assignment (other than an assignment of Term A-1 Loans or Term A-2 Loans).
(iv) Assignment and Assumption . The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided , however , that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
(v) No Assignment to Certain Persons . No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Company or any of the Company’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), (C) to a natural person or (D) a Disqualified Institution.
(vi) Certain Additional Payments . In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent, the
194
applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the Closing Date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement and shall for the purposes of the Loan Documents be a Lender, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be (x) entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01 , 3.04 , 3.05 , and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment and (y) otherwise subject to the obligations set forth in Section 10.07 . Upon request and following the return of any related Note issued to the assigning Lender, or in the case of any loss, theft or destruction of any such Note, a lost note affidavit from the assigning Lender in customary form, each Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section. Upon request by the Company, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Company of any transfer by a Lender of its rights or obligations under this Agreement not subject to the Company’s consent in the form of a list of current Lenders, although the failure to give any such information shall not affect any assignments or result in any liability by the Administrative Agent.
To the extent that an assignment of all or any portions of a Lender’s Commitments and/or Loans and related outstanding Obligations would, at the time of such assignment, result in increased costs or Taxes under Section 3.01 , 3.04 or 3.05 from those being charged by the respective assigning Lender prior to such assignment, then a Borrower shall not be obligated to pay or reimburse such increased costs (although the Company shall be obligated to pay any other increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective assignment).
The Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such, shall not be responsible or have any liability for, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with any provisions relating to Disqualified Institutions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
195
Administrative Agent, in its capacity as such, shall not (a) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender or participant or prospective Lender or participant is a Disqualified Institution or (b) have any liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or participation of Commitments or Loans, or disclosure of confidential information in connection therewith, to any Disqualified Institution; it being agreed that the foregoing shall not relieve the Administrative Agent, to the extent constituting a Lender, from its obligations in respect of Disqualified Institutions in connection with assignments and participations, and disclosure of confidential information in connection therewith, by it to the extent acting in its capacity as a Lender.
The Administrative Agent shall have the right, and the Company expressly authorizes the Administrative Agent, to (a) post the list of Disqualified Institutions provided by the Company and any updates thereto from time to time on the Platform, including that portion for the Platform that is designated for “public side” Lenders and/or (b) provide such list of Disqualified Institutions provided by the Company and any updates thereto to each Lender requesting the same.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any assignment or participation is made to any Disqualified Institution without the Company’s prior written consent, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution and the Administrative Agent, (A) terminate any Commitment of such Disqualified Institution and repay the outstanding amount of Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, accrued and unpaid fees and all other amounts owing to such Disqualified Institution, (B) in the case of any outstanding Loans, purchase such Loans by paying the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such Loans, plus in the case of clauses (A) and (B), accrued and unpaid interest thereon, accrued and unpaid fees and all other amounts due and payable to it hereunder and/or (C) require such Disqualified Institution to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 10.06 ), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees at the lesser of (x) the outstanding principal amount thereof and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such Loans, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, plus in the case of clauses (A) and (B), accrued and unpaid fees and all other amounts due and payable to it hereunder; provided that in the case of clause (C), the relevant assignment shall otherwise comply with this Section 10.06 .
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each Disqualified Institution (A) will not receive information provided solely to Lenders by any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any Lender (other than the list of Disqualified Institutions to any potential assignee who is a Disqualified Institution for the purpose of determining if such potential assignee is a Disqualified Institution) and will not be permitted to attend or participate in conference calls or meetings attended solely by the Lenders and the Administrative Agent, other than the right to receive notices of prepayments and other administrative notices in respect of its Loans or Commitments required to be delivered to Lenders pursuant to Article 2 and (B) (x) for purposes of determining whether the Required Lenders have (i) consented (or not consented) to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of any Loan Document or any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, (ii) otherwise acted on any matter related to any Loan Document, or (iii) directed or required the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under any Loan
196
Document, shall not have any right to consent (or not consent), otherwise act or direct or require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to take (or refrain from taking) any such action, and all Loans held by any Disqualified Institution shall be deemed to be not outstanding for all purposes of calculating whether the Required Lenders or all Lenders have taken any actions, except that no amendment, modification or waiver of any Loan Document shall, without the consent of the applicable Disqualified Institution, deprive any Disqualified Institution of its pro rata share of any payment to which all Lenders of the applicable Class of Loans are entitled and (y) hereby agrees that if a proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law shall be commenced by or against a Borrower or any other Loan Party, such Disqualified Institution will be deemed to vote in the same proportion as Lenders that are not Disqualified Institutions.
(c) Register . The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “ Register ”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d) Participations . Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Swing Line Lender or any L/C Issuer, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, a Defaulting Lender, the Company or any of the Company’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or, to the extent the list of Disqualified Institutions is made available to all Lenders, any Disqualified Institution) (each, a “ Participant ”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender’s participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “ Participant Register ”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan
197
Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and
207
agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

Capitalized terms used in this Guaranty and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings specified in the Credit Agreement.
The Lenders and the L/C Issuers have agreed to extend credit to the Designated Borrowers identified on Schedule A hereto, as amended or supplemented or deemed amended or supplemented from time to time in accordance with Paragraph 18 below, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers to extend such credit are conditioned upon, among other things, the execution and delivery of this Guaranty. Accordingly, for value received, the sufficient of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. Guaranty. The Guarantor hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, the Obligations of each Designated Borrower (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and/or the Sustainability Structuring Agent in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof in accordance with Section 10.04 of the Credit Agreement), and whether recovery upon such Obligations may be or hereafter becomes unenforceable or shall be an allowed or disallowed claim under any proceeding or case commenced by or against the Guarantor or any Designated Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code), and Canadian Insolvency Law, any successor statute or any other liquidation, conservatorship, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, moratorium, rearrangement, receivership, insolvency, reorganization, or similar debtor relief laws of the United States, Canada or other applicable jurisdictions from time to time in effect and affecting the rights of creditors generally (collectively, “ Debtor Relief Laws ”), and including interest that accrues after the commencement by or against any Designated Borrower of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws, but excluding any Excluded Swap Obligations (collectively, the “ Guaranteed Obligations ”). The Administrative Agent’s books and records showing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations
G-1- 1
shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon the Guarantor and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations absent manifest error. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.
2. No Setoff or Deductions; Taxes; Payments. The Guarantor represents and warrants that it is organized in the United States of America. The Guarantor shall make all payments hereunder without setoff or counterclaim and subject to, and in accordance with, Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement, free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes. The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty. All payments under this Guaranty shall be made in accordance with Section 2.13(a) of the Credit Agreement. The obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any acts of any legislative body or governmental authority affecting any Designated Borrower, including, but not limited to, any restrictions on the conversion of currency or repatriation or control of funds or any total or partial expropriation of any Designated Borrower’s property, or by economic, political, regulatory or other events in the countries where any Designated Borrower is located.
3. Rights of Administrative Agent. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Guarantor consents and agrees that the Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself and the Lenders, and the Lenders, may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of, or impair any Lien on, any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of the Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of the Guarantor.
4. Certain Waivers. The Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any Designated Borrower or any other guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Structuring Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer) of the liability of any Designated Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that the Guarantor’s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of any Designated Borrower; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting the Guarantor’s liability hereunder; (d) any right to require the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Structuring Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer to proceed against any Designated Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the Administrative Agent’s, the Sustainability Structuring Agent’s, any Lender’s
G-1- 2
or any L/C Issuer’s power whatsoever; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender; and (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties.
The Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations.
5. Obligations Independent . The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not any Designated Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party.
6. Subrogation. The Guarantor shall not exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full (other than contingent indemnification obligations that have not yet been asserted) and any commitments of the Lenders or facilities provided by the Lenders or any L/C Issuer with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations are terminated. If any amounts are paid to the Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders, to reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.
7. Termination; Reinstatement. This Guaranty is a continuing, absolute and irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until the Facility Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of any Designated Borrower or the Guarantor is made, or the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations of the Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.
8. Subordination. The Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of the Designated Borrowers owing to the Guarantor, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of the Designated Borrowers to the
G-1- 3
Guarantor as subrogee of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the L/C Issuers or resulting from the Guarantor’s performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein and to the extent permitted under the Credit Agreement, the Designated Borrowers may make any payment to the Guarantor in respect of such obligations and indebtedness. If the Administrative Agent so requests at any time following the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, any such obligation or indebtedness of the Designated Borrowers to the Guarantor shall be enforced and performance received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent, for itself, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty.
9. Stay of Acceleration. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against the Guarantor or any Designated Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor immediately upon written demand by the Administrative Agent.
10. [Intentionally Omitted] .
11. Miscellaneous. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, no provision of this Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified, except by a written instrument executed by the Administrative Agent and the Guarantor. No failure by the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision herein. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Guarantor in writing, this Guaranty is not intended to supersede or otherwise affect any other guaranty now or hereafter given by the Guarantor for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer or any term or provision thereof.
12. Condition of Designated Borrowers. The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from each Designated Borrower and any other guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of such Designated Borrower and any such other guarantor as the Guarantor requires, and that the Administrative Agent and the Lenders have no duty, and the Guarantor is not relying on the Administrative Agent or any Lender at any time, to disclose to the Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of any Designated Borrower or any other guarantor (the Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).
13. Setoff. If and to the extent any payment is not made when due hereunder and subject to Section 10.08 of the Credit Agreement, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may, at any time following the occurrence and during the continuance of Event of Default, set off and
G-1- 4
charge from time to time any amount so due against any or all of the Guarantor’s accounts or deposits with the Administrative Agent or such Lender, respectively.

FORM OF SUBSIDIARIES GUARANTY
This SUBSIDIARIES GUARANTY AGREEMENT (this “ Guaranty ”) is entered into as of [________] [___], 20__, among the undersigned, any other Person which may become a party hereto pursuant to a duly executed instrument of accession in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto (each a “ Guarantor ” and collectively, the “ Guarantors ”) and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself and the Lenders. Reference is hereby made to that certain Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of January 4, 2023 (as amended, restated, extended, supplemented or otherwise modified in writing from time to time, the “ Credit Agreement ”), among Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. (the “ Company ”), the Designated Borrowers from time to time party thereto (collectively with the Company, the “ Borrowers ”), the various Lenders from time to time party thereto (the “ Lenders ”), Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, an L/C Issuer and a Swing Line Lender, and Credit Agricole Corporate Investment Bank, as Sustainability Structuring Agent. Capitalized terms used in this Guaranty and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings specified in the Credit Agreement.
The Lenders and the L/C Issuers have agreed to extend credit to the Borrowers subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers to extend such credit are conditioned upon, among other things, the execution and delivery of this Guaranty. Each Guarantor is an Affiliate of the Borrowers, will derive substantial benefits from the extension of credit to the Borrowers pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is willing to execute and deliver this Guaranty in order to induce the Lenders and the L/C Issuers to extend such credit. Accordingly, for value received, the sufficient of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. Guaranty. Except for any release of any Guarantor pursuant to Section 9.10 of the Credit Agreement, each Guarantor hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, the Obligations (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Structuring Agent, the Lenders and/or the L/C Issuers in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof in accordance with Section 10.04 of the Credit Agreement), and whether recovery upon such Obligations may be or hereafter becomes unenforceable or shall be an allowed or disallowed claim under any proceeding or case commenced by or against any Guarantor or any Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code), any Canadian Insolvency Law, any successor statute or any other liquidation, conservatorship, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, moratorium, rearrangement, receivership, insolvency, reorganization, or similar debtor relief laws of the United States, Canada or other applicable jurisdictions from time to time in effect and affecting the rights of creditors generally (collectively, “ Debtor Relief Laws ”), and including interest that accrues after the commencement by or against such Borrower of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws, but excluding any Excluded Swap Obligations (collectively, the
G-2- 1
“ Guaranteed Obligations ”). The Administrative Agent’s books and records showing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon each Guarantor and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations absent manifest error. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of a Guarantor under this Guaranty, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder (other than any Guarantor which is incorporated under the laws of Canada or any province or territory thereof) at any time shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code) or any comparable provisions of any similar federal or state law.
2. No Setoff or Deductions; Taxes; Payments. Each Guarantor represents and warrants that it is organized in the United States of America or Canada. Each Guarantor shall make all payments hereunder without setoff or counterclaim and subject to, and in accordance with, Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement, free and clear of and without deduction for any Taxes. The obligations of each Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty. All payments under this Guaranty shall be made in accordance with Section 2.13(a) of the Credit Agreement. The obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any acts of any legislative body or governmental authority affecting any Borrower, including, but not limited to, any restrictions on the conversion of currency or repatriation or control of funds or any total or partial expropriation of such Borrower’s property, or by economic, political, regulatory or other events in the countries where such Borrower is located.
3. Rights of Administrative Agent. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself and the Lenders, and the Lenders, may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of, or impair any Lien on, any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guarantor.
4. Certain Waivers. Each Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any Borrower or any other guarantor, or the cessation from any cause
G-2- 2
whatsoever (including any act or omission of the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Structuring Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer) of the liability of any Borrower; (b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor’s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of any of the Borrowers; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor’s liability hereunder; (d) any right to require the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Structuring Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer to proceed against a Borrower, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Guaranteed Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the Administrative Agent’s, the Sustainability Structuring Agent’s, any Lender’s or any L/C Issuer’s power whatsoever; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by the Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders; and (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by applicable law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties. Each Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations.
5. Obligations Independent . The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against such Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not any Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party.
6. Subrogation. No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution , indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full (other than contingent indemnification obligations that have not yet been asserted) and any commitments of the Lenders or facilities provided by the Lenders or any L/C Issuer with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations are terminated. If any amounts are paid to a Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent, for itself, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, to reduce the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.
7. Termination; Reinstatement. Except for any release of a Guarantor pursuant to Section 9.10 of the Credit Agreement, this Guaranty is a continuing, absolute and irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until the Facility Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower or a Guarantor is made, or the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether
G-2- 3
or not the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender is in possession of or has released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations of each Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.
8. Subordination. Each Guarantor hereby subordinates the payment of all obligations and indebtedness of any Borrower owing to such Guarantor, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of any Borrower to such Guarantor as subrogee of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the L/C Issuer or resulting from such Guarantor’s performance under this Guaranty, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein and to the extent permitted under the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers may make any payment to such Guarantor in respect of such obligations and indebtedness. If the Administrative Agent so requests at any time following the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, any such obligation or indebtedness of such Borrower to such Guarantor shall be enforced and performance received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of itself, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty.
9. Stay of Acceleration. In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against any Guarantor or any Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors immediately upon written demand by the Administrative Agent.
10. Expenses . Each Guarantor shall pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent, the Sustainability Structuring Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders in accordance with Section 10.04 of the Credit Agreement.

11. Miscellaneous. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, no provision of this Guaranty may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified, except by a written instrument executed by the Administrative Agent and each Guarantor. No failure by the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision herein.
