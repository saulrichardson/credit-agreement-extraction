and (ii) the average of the two Credit Ratings if they differ by two or more Levels (unless the average is not a recognized Level,

the Borrower has (x) not received a Credit Rating from any Rating Agency or (x) received a Credit Rating from only one Rating
Agency that is neither S&P or Moody’s, the Applicable Margins shall be determined based on Level 6. The provisions of this
definition shall be subject to Section 2.6.(c).

three RFR Business Days before such Term RFR Loan, (III) in the case of an RFR Loan denominated in any Foreign Currency, at least
five RFR Business Days before such RFR Loan, and (IV) in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan denominated in any Foreign Currency,

of such borrowing, (3) the amount of such borrowing, which shall comply with clause (a) above, (4) whether such Loan is
to be a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, a Daily Simple RFR Loan, a Term RFR Loan or a Base Rate Loan, and (5) in the case of a Eurocurrency
Rate Loan or a Term RFR Loan, the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan
denominated in Dollars in a Notice of Borrowing, then the applicable Loans shall be made as Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests
a borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term RFR Loans in any such Notice of Borrowing, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it
will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. A Notice of Borrowing received after 9:00 a.m. shall be deemed

notify the Lenders of each Notice of Borrowing

(c)             Funding
of Loans . Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing under the immediately preceding subsection (b), the Administrative Agent
shall notify each Lender of the applicable Class of Loans so requested of the proposed borrowing and the Currency thereof. Each

by such Lender to the Borrower with the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office, in Same Day Funds not later than, 9:00 a.m. Pacific
time on the date of such proposed Loans. Subject to fulfillment of all applicable conditions set forth herein, the Administrative Agent
shall make available to the Borrower in the account specified in the Disbursement Instruction Agreement, not later than, 12:00 Noon Pacific
time on the date of the requested borrowing of Loans of such Class, the proceeds of such amounts received by the Administrative Agent.
(d)            Assumptions
Regarding Funding by Lenders . With respect to Loans to be made on or after the Effective Date, unless the Administrative Agent shall
have been notified by any Lender of a Class of Loans that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent a Loan
of such Class to be made by such Lender in connection with any borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender will
make the proceeds of such Loan available to the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Section, and the Administrative Agent may
(but shall not be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower the amount of such Loan to be provided
by such Lender. In such event, if such Lender does not make available to the Administrative Agent the proceeds of such Loan, then such
Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent on demand the amount of such Loan with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such Loan is made available to the Borrower but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by
the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment
to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Loans that are Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay
the amount of such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit
to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays to the Administrative Agent the
amount of such Loan, the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in the borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower
shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make available the proceeds
of a Loan to be made by such Lender (including, if applicable, treatment of such Lender as a Defaulting Lender in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement).

(c)             Borrower
Information Used to Determine Applicable Interest Rates . The parties understand that the applicable interest rate for the Obligations

certified to the Lenders by the Borrower (the “ Borrower Information ”). If it is subsequently determined that any such
Borrower Information was incorrect (for whatever reason) at the time it was delivered to the Administrative Agent, and if the applicable
interest rate or fees calculated for any period were lower than they should have been had the correct information been timely provided,
then, such interest rate and such fees for such period shall be automatically recalculated using correct Borrower Information. The Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower in writing of any additional interest and fees due because of such recalculation, and the Borrower
shall pay such additional interest or fees due to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, within 5 Business Days of
receipt of such written notice. Any recalculation of interest or fees required by this provision shall survive the termination of this
Agreement, and this provision shall not in any way limit any of the Administrative Agent’s, or any Lender’s other rights
under this Agreement (provided that if such additional interest or fees are paid within such 5 Business Day period, no Default or Event
of Default shall be deemed to have occurred under Section 11.1.(a) as a result of such underpayment).

effective date of such increase except to the extent that such representations and warranties expressly relate solely to an earlier date
(in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects (except in the case of a
representation or warranty qualified by materiality, in which case such representation or warranty shall have been true and correct in
all respects) on and as of such earlier date) and except for changes in factual circumstances specifically and expressly permitted hereunder

Agent shall have received each of the following, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent: (i) if
not previously delivered to the Administrative Agent, copies certified by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of each Loan Party of

and replacement Notes, as applicable, executed by the Borrower, payable to any existing Lenders of such Class increasing their respective
Commitments of such Class, in each case, in the amount of such Lender’s Commitment at the time of the effectiveness of the Commitment
Increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments of such Class. In connection with any increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments
of any Class pursuant to this Section 2.17. any Lender becoming a party hereto shall (1) execute such documents and agreements
as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request and (2) provide to the Administrative Agent, its name, address, tax identification
number and/or such other information as shall be necessary for the Administrative Agent to comply with “know your customer”

and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by Borrower, each Incremental Term Lender participating in such tranche and the
Administrative Agent. Each Incremental Term Loan Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to
effect the provisions of this Section 2.17 (which may include providing for additional currencies and/or benchmark interest rate
as may be agreed between the Borrower and the applicable Incremental Term Lenders). All Incremental Term Loans (i) shall rank pari
passu in right of payment with the other Loans, (ii) shall not mature earlier than the latest Maturity Date then in effect for any
then-existing Loans (but may have amortization prior to such date), and (iii) shall be treated substantially the same as (and in

terms and conditions applicable to any tranche of Incremental Term Loans maturing after the Maturity Date for any then-existing Loans
may provide for material additional or different financial or other covenants or prepayment requirements applicable only during periods
after the Maturity Date of such Term Loans and (II) each tranche of Incremental Term Loans may be priced differently than the other

transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the wiring instructions provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent
from time to time, for the account of such Lender at the applicable Lending Office of such Lender. If the due date of any payment under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document would otherwise fall on a day which is not a Business Day such date shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day and interest shall continue to accrue at the rate, if any, applicable to such payment for the period of
such extension.

(b)             Presumptions
Regarding Payments by Borrower . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on
which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment,
the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may (but shall not
be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not
in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent on demand that amount so distributed
to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the
date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent
in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
Section 3.2.             Pro
Rata Treatment . Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) each borrowing from
the Lenders under Sections 2.1.(a) or under any Class of Incremental Term Loans shall be made from the applicable Class of
Lenders pro rata according to the amount of their respective Commitments of such Class ; (b) [reserved]; (c) [reserved];
(d) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans shall be made for the account of the Lenders of the applicable Class pro
rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans of such Class held by them; (e) each payment of
interest on Loans of a Class shall be made for the account of the Lenders of such Class pro rata in accordance with the amounts
of interest on such Loans of such Class then due and payable to the respective Lenders; and (f) the Conversion and Continuation
of Loans of a particular Type and Class (other than Conversions provided for by Sections 5.1.(c) and 5.5.) shall be made
pro rata among the Lenders of such Class according to the amounts of their respective Loans of such Class and the then current
Interest Period for each such Lender’s portion of each such Loan of such Type and Class shall be coterminous.
Section 3.3.             Sharing
of Payments, Etc. . If a Lender shall obtain payment of any principal of, or interest on, any
Loan of a Class made by it to the Borrower under this Agreement or shall obtain payment on any other Obligation owing by the Borrower
or any other Loan Party through the exercise of any right of set-off, banker’s lien, counterclaim or similar right or otherwise
or through voluntary prepayments directly to a Lender or other payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Loan Party
to a Lender not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such payment should be distributed to the Lenders of the same Class in
accordance with Section 3.2. or Section 11.5., as applicable, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders
of such Class participations in (or, if and to the extent specified by such Lender, direct interests in) the Loans of such Class made
by the other Lenders of such Class or other Obligations owed to such other Lenders in such amounts, and make such other adjustments
from time to time as shall be equitable, to the end that all the Lenders of such Class shall share the benefit of such payment
(net of any reasonable expenses which may actually be incurred by such Lender in obtaining or preserving such benefit) in accordance
with the requirements of Section 3.2. or Section 11.5., as applicable. To such end, all the Lenders of such Class shall
make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored. The Borrower agrees that any Lender of such Class so purchasing a participation (or direct interest) in
the Loans or other Obligations owed to such other Lenders of such Class may exercise all rights of set-off, banker’s lien,
counterclaim or similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct holder of Loans of such Class in
the amount of such participation. Nothing contained herein shall require any Lender to exercise any such right or shall affect the right
of any Lender to exercise and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with respect to any other indebtedness or obligation
of the Borrower.

and as may be otherwise agreed to in writing from time to time by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.
Section 3.6.             Computations .
 Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, any accrued interest on any Loan denominated in Dollars, any Fees or any other Obligations
due hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed. All computations of interest
for Loans denominated in Sterling and any other Foreign Currency where the practice in the relevant foreign market is to compute interest

days, as the case may be, in each case for the actual number of days elapsed. All computations of interest on Loans denominated in any
Foreign Currency where the practice in the relevant foreign market is to compute interest on the basis of a year of 360 days shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed.
Section 3.7.             Usury .
 In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable on the Loans or other Obligations exceed the maximum rate of interest
allowed by Applicable Law and, if any such payment is paid by the Borrower or any other Loan Party or received by any Lender, then such
excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless the Borrower shall notify the respective Lender in writing that the Borrower
elects to have such excess sum returned to it forthwith. It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the Borrower not pay and
the Lenders not receive, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may be lawfully paid by the
Borrower under Applicable Law. The parties hereto hereby agree and stipulate that the only charge imposed upon the Borrower for the use
of money in connection with this Agreement is and shall be the interest specifically described in Sections 2.6.(a)(i) through
(iv). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto further agree and stipulate that all agency fees, syndication fees, facility
fees, ticking fees, closing fees, letter of credit fees, underwriting fees, default charges, late charges, funding or “breakage”
charges, increased cost charges, attorneys’ fees and reimbursement for costs and expenses paid by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender to third parties or for damages incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, in each case, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, are charges made to compensate the Administrative Agent or any such Lender
for underwriting or administrative services and costs or losses performed or incurred, and to be performed or incurred, by the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders in connection with this Agreement and shall under no circumstances be deemed to be charges for the use of money.

(a)            The
Administrative Agent will account to the Borrower monthly with a statement of Loans, accrued interest and Fees, charges and payments
made pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and, subject to the entries in the Register, which shall be controlling,
such account rendered by the Administrative Agent shall be deemed conclusive upon the Borrower absent manifest error. The failure of
the Administrative Agent to deliver such a statement of accounts shall not relieve or discharge the Borrower from any of its Obligations.
(b)            By
written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may request to receive monthly billings on a date (the “ Bill Lead Date ”)
that is prior to the first day of a month. The Administrative Agent will submit to the Borrower monthly billings, which will consist
of the actual interest and principal due through the Bill Lead Date plus projected interest and principal due through the balance,
if any, of such month. Any necessary adjustments in the applicable interest rate and/or principal payments due or made between a Bill
Lead Date and the end of a month will be reflected as an additional charge (or credit) in the billing for the next following month. Neither
the failure of the Administrative Agent to submit a Bill Lead Date billing nor any error in any such billing will excuse the Borrower’s
obligation to make full payment of all amounts due under this Agreement. In its sole discretion, the Administrative Agent may cancel
or modify the terms of such request which cancellation or modification will be effective upon written notification to the Borrower. Should
the Borrower request a Bill Lead Date, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to prepare a month end invoice.

Lender Waterfall . Any payment of principal, interest, Fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account
of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article XI. or otherwise) or received by the
Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 13.3. shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined
by the Administrative Agent as follows: first , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative
Agent hereunder; second , as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any
Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by
the Administrative Agent; third , if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account
and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under
this Agreement; fourth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations
under this Agreement; fifth , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower
as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result
of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise
directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in
Article VI. were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of such Class of all Non-Defaulting
Lenders of the applicable Class on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender
until such time as all Loans of such Class are held by the Lenders of such Class pro rata as if there had been no Defaulting
Lenders of such Class. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to
pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender,
and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
(c)             Defaulting
Lender Cure . If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative
Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set
forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or
take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans of the applicable Class to
be held pro rata by the Lenders of the applicable Class; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect
to Fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided , further ,
that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will
constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
(d)             Purchase
of Defaulting Lender’s Loans . During any period that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower may, by the Borrower giving
written notice thereof to the Administrative Agent, such Defaulting Lender and the other Lenders, demand that such Defaulting Lender
assign its Loans to an Eligible Assignee subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.5.(b). No party hereto shall
have any obligation whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding an Eligible Assignee. In addition, any Lender
who is not a Defaulting Lender may, but shall not be obligated, in its sole discretion, to acquire the face amount of all or a portion
of such Defaulting Lender’s Loans via an assignment subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.5.(b).
In connection with any such assignment, such Defaulting Lender shall promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to effect such
assignment, including an appropriate Assignment and Assumption and, notwithstanding Section 13.5.(b), shall pay to the Administrative
Agent an assignment fee in the amount of $7,500. The exercise by the Borrower of its rights under this Section shall be at the Borrower’s
sole cost and expense and at no cost or expense to the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders.

Free of Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan Party under any Loan Document
shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Applicable Law (as determined
in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment
by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely
pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and, if such Tax is
an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower or other applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after
such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been
made.
(c)             Payment
of Other Taxes by the Borrower . The Borrower and the other Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with Applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it (within 10 days after written demand
therefor) for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
(d)             Indemnification
by the Borrower . The Borrower and the other Loan Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after
written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable
to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such
Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly
or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf
of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(e)             Indemnification
by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for
(i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower or another Loan Party has not already
indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower and the other Loan
Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 13.5.
relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that
are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or
with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to
such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any
amount due to the Administrative Agent under this subsection. The provisions of this subsection shall continue to inure to the benefit
of an Administrative Agent following its resignation or removal as Administrative Agent.
(f)             Evidence
of Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or any other Loan Party to a Governmental Authority
pursuant to this Section, the Borrower or such other Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified
copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(g)             Status
of Lenders .
(i)            Any
Recipient that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document
shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit
such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Recipient, if reasonably requested
by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested
by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such
Recipient is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding
two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in the immediately
following clauses (ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D)) shall not be required if in the Recipient’s reasonable judgment such
completion, execution or submission would subject such Recipient to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice
the legal or commercial position of such Recipient.

exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may
be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required
to be made; and
(D)             if
a payment made to a Recipient under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Recipient

respect to such payments (and the Loan Parties and Administrative Agent agree to so treat Administrative Agent as a U.S. Person with
respect to such payments), with the effect that the Loan Parties can make payments to Administrative Agent without deduction or withholding
of any Taxes imposed by the United States.

(h)            Treatment
of Certain Refunds . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any
Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this
Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under
this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such
indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).
Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant
to this subsection (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such
indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection,
in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection the payment
of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if
the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification
payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any indemnified
party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying
party or any other Person.
(i)              Survival .

Yield Protection, Etc.
Section 5.1.             Additional
Costs; Capital Adequacy .
(a)             Capital
Adequacy . If any Lender determines that any Regulatory Change affecting such Lender or any lending office of such Lender or such
Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity ratios or requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing
the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence
of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender, or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such
Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Regulatory Change (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies
and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay
to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction
suffered.
(b)            Additional
Costs . In addition to, and not in limitation of the immediately preceding subsection, the Borrower shall promptly pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of a Lender from time to time such amounts as such Lender may determine to be necessary to compensate such Lender
for any costs incurred by such Lender that it reasonably determines are attributable to its making or maintaining of any Eurocurrency
Rate Loans or RFR Loans or its obligation to make any Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Loans hereunder, any reduction in any amount receivable
by such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any of such Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Loans
or such obligation or the maintenance by such Lender of capital in respect of its Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Loans or its Commitments
(other than any amounts included in the determination of “Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate” in the definition thereof) (such increases
in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called “ Additional Costs ”), resulting from any Regulatory
Change that:
(i)            changes
the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in respect of any
of such Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Loans or its Commitments (other than Indemnified Taxes, Taxes described in clauses (b) through
(d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and Connection Income Taxes);
(ii)           imposes
or modifies any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirements (other than Regulation D of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or other similar reserve requirement applicable to any other category of liabilities
or category of extensions of credit or other assets by reference to which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Rate Loans is determined
to the extent utilized when determining “Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate” for such Loans) relating to any extensions of credit
or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by such
Lender (or its parent corporation), or any commitment of such Lender (including, without limitation, the Commitments of such Lender hereunder);
or
(iii)          imposes
on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or the
Loans made by such Lender.
(c)             Lender’s
Suspension of Eurocurrency Rate Loans and RFR Loans . Without limiting the effect of the provisions of the immediately preceding subsections
(a) and (b), if by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Lender either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the
excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of such Lender that includes deposits by
reference to which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Loans is determined as provided in this Agreement or a category
of extensions of credit or other assets of such Lender that includes Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Loans or (ii) becomes subject
to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets that it may hold, then, if such Lender so elects by notice
to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the obligation of such Lender to make or Continue, or to Convert Base Rate
Loans into, Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Loans hereunder shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in
which case the provisions of Section 5.5. shall apply).

(d)            [Reserved]
(e)             Notification
and Determination of Additional Costs . Each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender, as the case may be, agrees to notify the
Borrower (and in the case of a Lender, to notify the Administrative Agent) in writing of any event occurring after the Agreement Date
entitling the Administrative Agent or such Lender to compensation under any of the preceding subsections of this Section as promptly
as practicable; provided , however , that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to give such notice shall
not release the Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder; provided , further , that the Borrower shall not be required
to compensate the Administrative Agent or a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered
more than six months prior to the date that the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the
Regulatory Change giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of the intention of the Administrative Agent or such Lender
to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Regulatory Change giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive,
then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). The Administrative
Agent and each Lender, as the case may be, agrees to furnish to the Borrower (and in the case of a Lender to the Administrative Agent
as well) a certificate setting forth the basis and amount of each request for compensation under this Section. Determinations by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of the effect of any Regulatory Change shall, provided that such determinations
are made on a reasonable basis and in good faith, be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. The Borrower shall
pay the Administrative Agent and or any such Lender, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof.

manifest error) that (x) if Adjusted Daily Simple RFR is utilized in any calculations hereunder or under any other Loan Document
with respect to any Obligations, interest, fees, commissions or other amounts, reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining
Adjusted Daily Simple RFR pursuant to the definition thereof or (y) if Term RFR is utilized in any calculations hereunder or under
any other Loan Document with respect to any Obligations, interest, fees, commissions or other amounts, reasonable and adequate means
do not exist for ascertaining Term RFR for the applicable Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term RFR Loan on or prior to the
first day of such Interest Period, (B) the Administrative Agent shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive
and binding absent manifest error) that a fundamental change has occurred in the foreign exchange markets with respect to an applicable
Foreign Currency (including changes in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates
or exchange controls) or (C) the Requisite Lenders shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding
absent manifest error) that (x) if Adjusted Daily Simple RFR is utilized in any calculations hereunder or under any other Loan Document
with respect to any Obligations, interest, fees, commissions or other amounts, Adjusted Daily Simple RFR does not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans or (y) if Term RFR is utilized in any calculations hereunder
or under any other Loan Document with respect to any Obligations, interest, fees, commissions or other amounts, Term RFR does not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans during the applicable Interest Period and, in the case
of (x) or (y), the Requisite Lenders have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, then, in each case,
the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower. Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower,

revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of RFR Loans in each such affected Currency (to the extent
of the affected RFR Loans or, in the case of Term RFR Loans, the affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, (I) in the case of
any request for a borrowing of an affected RFR Loan in Dollars, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a
request for a borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (II) in the case of any request
for a borrowing of an affected RFR Loan in a Foreign Currency, then such request shall be ineffective and (B)(I) any outstanding
affected RFR Loans denominated in Dollars will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans immediately or, in the case of Term
RFR Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest Period and (II) any outstanding affected RFR Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency,

Period or (2) be prepaid in full immediately or, in the case of Term RFR Loans, at the end of the applicable Interest Period; provided
 that if no election is made by the Borrower by the date that is three Business Days after receipt by the Borrower of such notice
or, in the case of Term RFR Loans, the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable RFR Loan, if earlier, the Borrower
shall be deemed to have elected clause (1) above. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest
(except with respect to any prepayment or conversion of a Daily Simple RFR Loan) on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with
any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 5.4.

and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for the ascertaining the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate
for such Currency and Interest Period, including because the Screen Rate for the applicable Currency is not available or published on
a current basis, or (D) the Requisite Lenders shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent
manifest error) that the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining
such Loans during such Interest Period and shall have provided notice of such determination to the Administrative Agent, then, in each
case, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower. Upon notice thereof by the Administrative Agent to
the Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans in each such Currency, and any right of the Borrower to continue

anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, with respect to any
Benchmark, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace such Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement.
Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after
the Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected Lenders and the Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent
has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Requisite Class Lenders

of such Benchmark for the applicable Currency setting and subsequent Benchmark settings, without any amendment to, or further action
or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that this clause 5.2.(c)(i)(B) shall
not be effective unless the Administrative Agent has delivered to the Lenders and the Borrower a Term RFR Notice with respect to the
applicable Term RFR Transition Event. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to deliver a Term RFR

rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (2) the regulatory supervisor for
the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such
Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period”

Simple RFR Loan) on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 5.4. During
a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to any Benchmark or at any time that a tenor for any then-current Benchmark is not an
Available Tenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark that is the subject of such Benchmark Unavailability
Period or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of Base Rate.
(d)             Foreign
Currencies . If any change in currency controls or exchange regulations or any change in national or international financial, political
or economic conditions are imposed in the country in which such currency is issued, and such change results in, in the reasonable opinion
of the Administrative Agent (i) such currency no longer being readily available, freely transferable and convertible into Dollars,
(ii) a Dollar Equivalent no longer being readily calculable with respect to such currency, (iii) such currency being impracticable
for the Lenders to loan or (iv) such currency no longer being a currency in which the Requisite Lenders are willing to make, Continue
or Convert Loans (each of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), a “ Disqualifying Event ”), then the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders and the Borrower, and such currency shall no longer be a Foreign Currency until such time as
the Disqualifying Event(s) no longer exist. Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such notice from the Administrative
Agent, the Borrower shall repay all Loans denominated in such currency to which the Disqualifying Event(s) apply or convert such
Loans into the Dollar Equivalent in Dollars, bearing interest at the Base Rate, subject to the other terms contained herein.

Section 5.3.             Illegality .
 If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or any change in, any Applicable Law or any change in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by any of the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of
the Lenders (or any of their respective Lending Offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any Daily Simple RFR
Loan, Term RFR Loan or Eurocurrency Rate Loan, or to determine or charge interest based upon any applicable RFR, Adjusted Daily Simple
RFR, Term RFR, the Eurocurrency Rate or the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Administrative
Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice to the Borrower and the other Lenders. Thereafter, until the Administrative
Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, (i) any obligation of the Lenders to make RFR Loans or Eurocurrency
Rate Loans, as applicable, in the affected Currency or Currencies, and any right of the Borrower to convert any Loan denominated in Dollars
to an RFR Loan or continue any Loan as an RFR Loan or a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, as applicable, in the affected Currency or Currencies
shall be suspended and (ii) if necessary to avoid such illegality, the Administrative Agent shall compute the Base Rate without
reference to clause (c) of the definition of “Base Rate”, in each case until each such affected Lender notifies the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such
notice, the Borrower shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent),
prepay or, if applicable, (A) convert all RFR Loans denominated in Dollars to Base Rate Loans or (B) convert all RFR Loans
or Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an affected Foreign Currency to Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal

compute the Base Rate without reference to clause (c) of the definition of “Base Rate”), (I) with respect to Daily
Simple RFR Loans, on the next interest payment date therefor, if all affected Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain such Daily Simple
RFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Daily Simple RFR Loans to such day or
(II) with respect to Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term RFR Loans, on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if all affected
Lenders may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term RFR Loans, as applicable, to such day, or immediately,
if any Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term RFR Loans, as applicable, to such day. Upon
any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest (except with respect to any prepayment or conversion
of a Daily Simple RFR Loan) on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 5.4.
Section 5.4.             Compensation .
 The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender, within 10 days following the written request
of such Lender through the Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Lender for any loss,
cost or expense that such Lender reasonably determines is attributable to:
(a)            any
payment or prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a Term RFR Loan, or Conversion of a Eurocurrency
Rate Loan or Term RFR Loan, made by such Lender for any reason (including, without limitation, acceleration) on a date other than the
last day of the Interest Period for such Loan; or
(b)            any
failure by the Borrower for any reason (including, without limitation, the failure of any of the applicable conditions precedent specified
in Section 6.2. to be satisfied) to borrow a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a Term RFR Loan from such Lender on the date for such borrowing,
or to Convert a Base Rate Loan into a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Term RFR Loan or Continue a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Term RFR Loan on
the requested date of such Conversion or Continuation.
Not in limitation of the foregoing, such compensation
shall include, without limitation, (i) in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, an amount equal to the then present value of (A) the
amount of interest that would have accrued on such Eurocurrency Rate Loan for the remainder of the Interest Period at the rate applicable
to such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, less (B) the amount of interest that would accrue on the same Eurocurrency Rate Loan for the same
period if the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate were set on the date on which such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was repaid, prepaid or Converted or
the date on which the Borrower failed to borrow, Convert or Continue such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, as applicable, calculating present
value by using as a discount rate the applicable Eurocurrency Rate quoted on such date, and (ii) in the case of a Term RFR Loan,
an amount equal to the then present value of (A) the amount of interest that would have accrued on such Term RFR Loan for the remainder
of the Interest Period at the rate applicable to such Loan, less (B) the amount of interest that would accrue on the same Term
RFR Loan for the same period if the applicable Term RFR were set on the date on which such Term RFR Loan was repaid or prepaid or the
date on which the Borrower failed to borrow or Continue such Term RFR Loan, as applicable, calculating present value by using as a discount
rate the applicable Term TFR quoted on such date; provided , that any such compensation shall, for the avoidance of doubt, in no
event include any lost profit. Upon the Borrower’s request, the Administrative Agent will provide to the Borrower, on behalf of
any Lender seeking compensation under this Section, a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such
compensation and the method for determining the amount thereof. Any such statement shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

denominated in Dollars shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for
such Term RFR Loans or the next interest payment date in the case of such Daily Simple RFR Loans (or, in each case, in the case of a
Conversion required by Section 5.1.(c), Section 5.2., or Section 5.3. on such earlier date as such Lender or the Administrative
Agent, as applicable, may specify to the Borrower in writing (with a copy to the Administrative Agent, as applicable)) and, unless and
until such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, gives written notice as provided below that the circumstances specified
in Section 5.1., Section 5.2. or Section 5.3. that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:
(b)            to
the extent that such Lender’s RFR Loans denominated in Dollars have been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal
that would otherwise be applied to such Lender’s RFR Loans shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and
(c)            all
Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender as RFR Loans denominated in Dollars shall be made or Continued instead

If such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as
applicable, gives written notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent, as applicable) that the circumstances specified
in Section 5.1.(c), 5.2. or 5.3. that gave rise to the Conversion of such Lender’s RFR Loans pursuant to this Section no
longer exist (which such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to
exist) at a time when RFR Loans denominated in Dollars and made by other Lenders are outstanding, then such Lender’s Base Rate
Loans shall be automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding
RFR Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto, all Loans held by the Lenders holding RFR Loans denominated
in Dollars and by such Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, Types and Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Shares of the applicable Class of Loans.

Lenders . If (a) a Lender requests compensation pursuant to Section 3.10. or 5.1.,
or is a Lender that sold a participation to a Participant that requests compensation pursuant to Section 3.10. or 5.1., and the
Requisite Lenders are not also doing the same, (b) (i) the obligation of any Lender to make Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR
Loans or to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, Eurocurrency Rate Loans or RFR Loans shall be suspended pursuant to Section 5.1.(c),

of any Lender to make or to Continue Foreign Currency Rate Loans in a particular Currency shall be suspended pursuant to Section 5.1.(c),
5.2. or 5.3. but the obligation of the Requisite Lenders shall not have been suspended under such Sections or (c) a Lender becomes
a Non-Consenting Lender, then, so long as there does not then exist any Default or Event of Default, the Borrower may either (i) demand
that such Lender (the “ Affected Lender ”), and upon such demand the Affected Lender shall promptly, assign its Commitments
and Loans to an Eligible Assignee subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.5.(b) for a purchase price
equal to the aggregate principal balance of all Loans then owing to the Affected Lender, plus  any accrued but unpaid
interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees owing to the Affected Lender, or any other amount as may be mutually agreed upon by such
Affected Lender and Eligible Assignee or (ii) pay to the Affected Lender the aggregate principal balance of the Loans then owing
to the Affected Lender, plus any accrued but unpaid interest and accrued but unpaid fees owing to the Affected Lender (or such other
amount as may be mutually agreed upon by the Borrower and such Affected Lender), and by written notice to such Affected Lender, terminate
such Affected Lender’s Commitments, whereupon the Affected Lender shall no longer be a party hereto or have any rights or obligations
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents (but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.10., 5.1., 5.4.,
13.2. and 13.9. and the other provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as provided in Section 13.10. with respect
to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such payment). Each of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and
the Affected Lender shall reasonably cooperate in effectuating the replacement of such Affected Lender under this Section, but at no
time shall the Administrative Agent, such Affected Lender, any other Lender or any Titled Agent be obligated in any way whatsoever to
initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding an Eligible Assignee. The exercise by the Borrower of its rights under this Section shall
be at the Borrower’s sole cost and expense and at no cost or expense to the Administrative Agent, the Affected Lender or any of
the other Lenders; provided , however , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Borrower shall
not be obligated to reimburse or otherwise pay an Affected Lender’s administrative or legal costs incurred as a result of the Borrower’s
exercise of its rights under this Section. The terms of this Section shall not in any way limit the Borrower’s obligation
to pay to any Affected Lender compensation owing to such Affected Lender pursuant to this Agreement (including, without limitation, pursuant
to Section 3.10., 5.1. or 5.4.) with respect to any period up to the date of replacement. In connection with any such assignment
under this Section 5.6., such Affected Lender shall promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to effect such assignment,
including an appropriate Assignment and Assumption; provided that such Affected Lenders’ failure to execute an Assignment
and Assumption within five Business Days after written request by the Borrower shall not prevent the effectiveness of such assignment.

internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate an alternate Lending Office with respect to any of its Loans affected
by the matters or circumstances described in Section 3.10., 5.1. or 5.3. to reduce the liability of the Borrower or avoid the results
provided thereunder, so long as such designation is not disadvantageous to such Lender as determined by such Lender in its sole discretion,
except that such Lender shall have no obligation to designate a Lending Office located in the United States of America.
Section 5.8.       Assumptions
Concerning Funding of Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Term RFR Loans . Calculation of all amounts
payable to a Lender under this Article shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term RFR
Loans, as applicable, through the purchase of deposits in the relevant market bearing interest at the rate applicable to such Eurocurrency
Rate Loans or Term RFR Loans, in an amount equal to the amount of the Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Term RFR Loans and having a maturity
comparable to the relevant Interest Period, as applicable; provided , however , that each Lender may fund each of its Eurocurrency
Rate Loans and Term RFR Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumption shall be used only for calculation of amounts payable
under this Article.

Plans, each Qualified Plan has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or is maintained under a prototype plan and
may rely upon a favorable opinion letter issued by the IRS with respect to such prototype plan, or an application for such a letter is

the passage of time, the giving of notice, or both, would constitute, a default or event of default by, any Loan Party or any other Subsidiary
under any agreement (other than this Agreement but, with respect to each Subsidiary of the Borrower, including its articles of incorporation
or formation, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement or other similar organizational documents) or judgment,
decree or order to which any such Person is a party or by which any such Person or any of its respective properties may be bound where

Laws . In the ordinary course of business, and from time to time, each of the Borrower, each other Loan Party and each other Subsidiary

and the Properties, (ii) has obtained all Governmental Approvals which are required under Environmental Laws, and each such Governmental
Approval is in full force and effect, and (iii) is in compliance with all terms and conditions of such Governmental Approvals, where
with respect to each of the immediately preceding clauses (i) through (iii) the failure to obtain or to comply with could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except for any of the following matters that could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect, no Loan Party has any knowledge of, or has received notice of, any past, present, or pending releases, events,
conditions, circumstances, activities, practices, incidents, facts, occurrences, actions, or plans that, with respect to any Loan Party
or any other Subsidiary, their respective businesses, operations or with respect to the Properties, may: (x) cause or contribute
to an actual or alleged violation of or noncompliance with Environmental Laws, (y) cause or contribute to any other potential common-law
or legal claim or other liability, or (z) cause any of the Properties to become subject to any restrictions on ownership, occupancy,
use or transferability under any Environmental Law or require the filing or recording of any notice, approval or disclosure document

to the on-site or off-site manufacture, generation, processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport, removal,
clean up or handling, or the emission, discharge, release or threatened release of any wastes or Hazardous Material, or any other requirement
under Environmental Law. There is no civil, criminal, or administrative action, suit, demand, claim, hearing, notice, or demand letter,
mandate, order, lien, request, investigation, or proceeding pending or, to the Borrower’s knowledge, threatened, against the Borrower,
any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary relating in any way to Environmental Laws which, reasonably could be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. None of the Properties is listed on or proposed for listing on the National Priority List promulgated pursuant
to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and its implementing regulations, or any state or
local priority list promulgated pursuant to any analogous state or local law, except to the extent all such listings taken together could

is in effect, the Borrower shall comply with the following covenants:
Section 10.1.       Financial
Covenants .
(a)             Ratio
of Total Liabilities to Gross Asset Value . Except as provided in this subsection (a) below, the Borrower shall not permit the
ratio of (i) Total Liabilities of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis to (ii) Gross Asset
Value of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis to exceed 0.60 to 1.00 at the end of any fiscal quarter
of the Borrower. For purposes of calculating this ratio, (A) Total Liabilities shall be adjusted by deducting therefrom an amount
equal to the lesser of (x) unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the date of determination
in excess of $30,000,000 and (y) the amount of Total Liabilities that matures on or before the date that is 24 months from the date
of the calculation and (B) Gross Asset Value shall be adjusted by deducting therefrom the amount by which Total Liabilities is adjusted
under the immediately preceding clause (A). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall have the option, exercisable two times
during the term of this Agreement, to elect that the ratio of Total Liabilities to Gross Asset Value may exceed 0.60 to 1.00 for any

(b)             Ratio
of EBITDA to Fixed Charges . The Borrower shall not permit, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, the ratio of (i) EBITDA
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period to (ii) Fixed Charges of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, to be less than 1.50 to 1.00 at the end of such fiscal quarter;
 provided that such ratio shall be calculated on a pro forma basis on the assumption that (A) any Indebtedness incurred by
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries since the first day of such four-quarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom
(including to refinance other Indebtedness since the first day of such four-quarter period) had occurred on the first day of such period,
(B) the repayment or retirement of any other Indebtedness of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries since the first day of such
four-quarter period had occurred on the first day of such period (except that, in making such computation, the amount of Indebtedness
under any revolving credit facility, line of credit or similar facility shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such
Indebtedness during such period), and (C) in the case of any acquisition or disposition by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any
asset or group of assets since the first day of such four-quarter period, including, without limitation, by merger, stock purchase or
sale, or asset purchase or sale, such acquisition or disposition had occurred on the first day of such period with the appropriate adjustments
with respect to such acquisition or disposition being included in such pro forma calculation; provided that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the amount of scheduled principal payments (excluding balloon, bullet or similar payments of principal due upon the stated
maturity of Indebtedness) made that are included in clause (b) of the calculation of Fixed Charges for such period shall be determined
on an actual rather than pro forma basis. If any Indebtedness incurred after the first day of the relevant four-quarter period bears
interest at a floating rate then, for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charges, the interest rate on such Indebtedness shall be computed
on a pro forma basis as if the average interest rate which would have been in effect during the entire such four-quarter period had been
the applicable rate for the entire such period.
(c)             Dividends
and Other Restricted Payments . Subject to the following sentence, if an Event of Default exists, the Borrower shall not declare or
make, or incur any liability to make, Restricted Payments during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount
in excess of the greater of (i) the sum of (A) 95% of Adjusted Funds From Operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries determined
on a consolidated basis for such period plus (B) the amount of cash distributions made to the holders of the Borrower’s
Preferred Stock for such period and (ii) the minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made by the Borrower to its shareholders
to maintain compliance with Section 8.12. and to avoid the payment of any income or excise taxes imposed under Section 857(b)(1),
857(b)(3) or 4981 of the Internal Revenue Code; provided that the Borrower may repurchase or redeem Preferred Stock with
the net proceeds received by the Borrower from the issuance by the Borrower of Preferred Stock or common stock. If an Event of Default
under Section 11.1.(a), 11.1.(e) or 11.1.(f) shall exist, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary (other than Wholly Owned
Subsidiaries) shall directly or indirectly declare or make, or incur any liability to make, any Restricted Payments other than Restricted
Payments described in the immediately preceding clause (ii).

end of any fiscal quarter, to exceed 0.40 to 1.00 as at the end of such fiscal quarter.
(e)             Ratio
of Unsecured Indebtedness to Unencumbered Asset Value . Except as provided in this subsection (e) below, the Borrower shall not
permit the ratio of (i) the aggregate principal amount of Unsecured Indebtedness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries determined
on a consolidated basis to (ii) Unencumbered Asset Value of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis,
to exceed 0.60 to 1.00 at the end of any fiscal quarter of the Borrower. For purposes of calculating this ratio, (A) Unsecured Indebtedness
shall be adjusted by deducting therefrom an amount equal to the lesser of (x) unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries as of the date of determination in excess of $30,000,000 and (y) the amount of Unsecured Indebtedness that
matures on or before the date that is 24 months from the date of the calculation and (B) Unencumbered Asset Value shall be adjusted
by deducting therefrom the amount by which Unsecured Indebtedness is adjusted under the immediately preceding clause (A) (to the
extent such amounts were included in Unencumbered Asset Value). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall have the option, exercisable
two times during the term of this Agreement, to elect that the ratio of Unsecured Indebtedness to Unencumbered Asset Value may exceed
0.60 to 1.00 for any fiscal quarter in which the Borrower completes a Material Acquisition and the immediately subsequent three fiscal
quarters so long as (1) the Borrower has delivered a written notice to the Administrative Agent that the Borrower is exercising
its option under this subsection (b) and (2) the ratio of Unsecured Indebtedness to Unencumbered Asset Value does not

quarters.

The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any of them may otherwise have under Applicable Law. In exercising their
respective rights and remedies the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may be selective and no failure or delay by any such Lender Party

other or further exercise or the exercise of any other power or right.
(b)             Enforcement
by Administrative Agent . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the authority to
enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents against the Loan Parties or any of them shall be vested exclusively
in, and all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the
Administrative Agent in accordance with Article XI. for the benefit of all the Lenders; provided that the foregoing shall

available to it and as authorized by the Requisite Lenders.
Article XII.
The Administrative Agent
Section 12.1.       Appointment
and Authorization . Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such action as contractual representative on such Lender’s behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with
such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Not in limitation of the foregoing, each Lender authorizes and directs the Administrative
Agent to enter into the Loan Documents (other than this Agreement) for the benefit of the Lenders. Each Lender hereby agrees that, except
as otherwise set forth herein, any action taken by the Requisite Lenders in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or the Loan
Documents, and the exercise by the Requisite Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of the Lenders. Nothing herein shall be construed to deem the
Administrative Agent a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender or to impose on the Administrative Agent duties or obligations other than
those expressly provided for herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the terms “Agent”, “Administrative
Agent”, “agent” and similar terms in the Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended
to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any Applicable Law. Instead, use
of such terms is merely a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent
contracting parties. The Administrative Agent shall deliver or otherwise make available to each Lender, promptly upon receipt thereof
by the Administrative Agent, copies of each of the financial statements, certificates, notices and other documents delivered to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to Article IX. that the Borrower is not otherwise required to deliver directly to the Lenders. The Administrative
Agent will furnish to any Lender, upon the request of such Lender, a copy (or, where appropriate, an original) of any document, instrument,
agreement, certificate or notice furnished to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate of
the Borrower, pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document not already delivered or otherwise made available to such Lender
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any such other Loan Document. As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of any of the Obligations), the Administrative Agent shall not be required
to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in
so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Requisite Lenders (or all of the Lenders if explicitly required under
any other provision of this Agreement), and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of any of the Obligations;
 provided , however , that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not
be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or Applicable Law. Not in limitation of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may exercise any right or remedy
it or the Lenders may have under any Loan Document upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default unless the Requisite Lenders
have directed the Administrative Agent otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever
against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the Requisite Lenders, or where applicable, all the Lenders.

Section 12.2.       Administrative

it under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct
in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein or therein as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable
judgment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (including its own
counsel or counsel for the Borrower or any other Loan Party), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall
not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants
or experts. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties: (a) makes any warranty or representation to any Lender,
or any other Person, or shall be responsible to any Lender or any other Person for any statement, warranty or representation made or
deemed made by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document;
(b) shall have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions
of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the satisfaction of any conditions precedent under this Agreement or any Loan Document
on the part of the Borrower or other Persons, or to inspect the property, books or records of the Borrower or any other Person; (c) shall
be responsible to any Lender for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto or any collateral covered thereby or the perfection
or priority of any Lien in favor of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lender Parties in any such collateral; (d) shall have
any liability in respect of any recitals, statements, certifications, representations or warranties contained in any of the Loan Documents
or any other document, instrument, agreement, certificate or statement delivered in connection therewith; and (e) shall incur any
liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument
or writing (which may be by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail) believed by it to be genuine and signed, sent or given by the proper
party or parties. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under the Loan Documents by or through agents, employees or
attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such agent or attorney-in-fact as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment.

Section 12.3.       Notice
of Events of Default . The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice
of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower
referring to this Agreement, describing with reasonable specificity such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is
a “notice of default.” If any Lender (excluding the Lender which is also serving as the Administrative Agent) becomes aware
of any Default or Event of Default, it shall promptly send to the Administrative Agent such a “notice of default”; provided ,
that a Lender’s failure to provide such a “notice of default” to the Administrative Agent shall not result in any liability
of such Lender to any other party to any of the Loan Documents. Further, if the Administrative Agent receives such a “notice of
default,” the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.
Section 12.4.       Administrative
Agent as Lender . The Lender acting as Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers
as a Lender or a Specified Derivatives Provider, as the case may be, under this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any Specified
Derivatives Contract as the case may be, as any other Lender or Specified Derivatives Provider and may exercise the same as though it
were not the Administrative Agent; and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated,
include the Lender acting as Administrative Agent in each case in its individual capacity. Such Lender and its Affiliates may each accept
deposits from, maintain deposits or credit balances for, invest in, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, serve as financial
advisor to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate thereof as if
it were any other bank and without any duty to account therefor to the other Lenders or any Specified Derivatives Providers. Further,
the Administrative Agent and any Affiliate may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other
Subsidiary for services in connection with this Agreement or any Specified Derivatives Contract, or otherwise without having to account
for the same to the other Lenders or any Specified Derivatives Providers. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities,
the Lender acting as Administrative Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Borrower, other Loan Parties, other
Subsidiaries and other Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Person)
and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them.
Section 12.5.       Approvals
of Lenders . All communications from the Administrative Agent to any Lender requesting such Lender’s
determination, consent or approval (a) shall be given in the form of a written notice to such Lender, (b) shall be accompanied
by a description of the matter or issue as to which such determination, consent or approval is requested, or shall advise such Lender
where information, if any, regarding such matter or issue may be inspected, or shall otherwise describe the matter or issue to be resolved
and (c) shall include, if reasonably requested by such Lender and to the extent not previously provided to such Lender, written
materials provided to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower in respect of the matter or issue to be resolved. Unless a Lender shall
give written notice to the Administrative Agent that it specifically objects to the requested determination, consent or approval within
10 Business Days (or such lesser or greater period as may be specifically required under the express terms of the Loan Documents)
of receipt of such communication, such Lender shall be deemed to have conclusively approved such requested determination, consent or
approval. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any amendment, waiver or consent regarding any of the matters described

Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent but not as a Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents, any
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents (collectively,
 “ Indemnifiable Amounts ”); provided , however , that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such
Indemnifiable Amounts to the extent resulting from the Administrative Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment; provided , further , however , that no action
taken in accordance with the directions of the Requisite Lenders (or all of the Lenders, if expressly required hereunder) shall be deemed
to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each Lender agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation
of the Borrower to do so) promptly upon demand for its Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the applicable reimbursement is
sought) of any out-of-pocket expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the counsel to the Administrative Agent) incurred
by the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, administration, or enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise) of, or legal advice with respect to the rights or responsibilities of the parties under,
the Loan Documents, any suit or action brought by the Administrative Agent to enforce the terms of the Loan Documents and/or collect
any Obligations, any “lender liability” suit or claim brought against the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders, and any
claim or suit brought against the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders arising under any Environmental Laws. Such out-of-pocket expenses
(including counsel fees) shall be advanced by the Lenders on the request of the Administrative Agent notwithstanding any claim or assertion
that the Administrative Agent is not entitled to indemnification hereunder upon receipt of an undertaking by the Administrative Agent
that the Administrative Agent will reimburse the Lenders if it is actually and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
that the Administrative Agent is not so entitled to indemnification. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of
the Loans and all other Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. If the Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for
any Indemnifiable Amount following payment by any Lender to the Administrative Agent in respect of such Indemnifiable Amount pursuant
to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall share such reimbursement on a ratable basis with each Lender making any such payment.
Section 12.7.       Lender
Credit Decision, Etc. . Each of the Lenders expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither the
Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties has made any representations or warranties to such Lender and that no act by the
Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary
or Affiliate, shall be deemed to constitute any such representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each of the
Lenders acknowledges that it has made its own credit and legal analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Administrative
Agent, or any of their respective Related Parties, and based on the financial statements of the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the
other Subsidiaries and other Affiliates, and inquiries of such Persons, its independent due diligence of the business and affairs of
the Borrower, the other Loan Parties, the other Subsidiaries and other Persons, its review of the Loan Documents, the legal opinions
required to be delivered to it hereunder, the advice of its own counsel and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate.
Each of the Lenders also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender
or counsel to the Administrative Agent or any of their respective Related Parties, and based on such review, advice, documents and information
as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under the Loan Documents.
The Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Borrower or any other
Loan Party of the Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for therein or to inspect the properties or books of,
or make any other investigation of, the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary. Except for notices, reports and other
documents and information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower, any other
Loan Party or any other Affiliate thereof which may come into possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties. Each
of the Lenders acknowledges that the Administrative Agent’s legal counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is only acting as counsel to the Administrative Agent and is not acting as counsel to any Lender.

Section 12.8.       Successor
Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent may resign at any time as Administrative Agent
under the Loan Documents by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. The Administrative Agent may be removed as
administrative agent by the Requisite Lenders (excluding for such purpose Loans and Commitments held by the Lender then acting as Administrative
Agent) upon 30 days’ prior written notice if the Administrative Agent (i) is found by a court of competent jurisdiction in
a final, non-appealable judgment to have committed gross negligence or willful misconduct in the course of performing its duties hereunder
or (ii) the Lender then acting as Administrative Agent has become a Defaulting Lender under clause (d) of the definition of
that term. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Requisite Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent
which appointment shall, provided no Event of Default exists, be subject to the Borrower’s approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, it being understood that the approval of the Borrower will not be required for a Lender (other than
a Defaulting Lender) or Affiliate of a Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) to become a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor
Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and shall have accepted such
appointment, within 30 days after the current Administrative Agent’s giving of notice of resignation or having been removed, then,
in the case of resignation by the Administrative Agent, the current Administrative Agent may, or in the case of removal of the Administrative
Agent, the Requisite Lenders may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a Lender, if any
Lender shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be an Eligible Assignee and in any case shall have an office in the United States;
 provided that if no Lender has accepted such appointment, then such resignation or removal shall nonetheless become effective
in accordance with such notice and (1) the Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the
Administrative Agent shall instead be made to each Lender directly, until such time as a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed
as provided for above in this Section; provided , further that such Lenders so acting directly shall be and be deemed to
be protected when so acting in such capacity by all indemnities and other provisions herein for the benefit and protection of the Administrative
Agent as if each such Lender were itself the Administrative Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder
by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the current Administrative Agent, and the current Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. After any Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative
Agent, the provisions of this Article XII. shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative
Agent may assign its rights and duties under the Loan Documents to any of its Affiliates by giving the Borrower and each Lender prior
written notice.

Section 12.9.       Titled
Agents . Each of the Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agents, and the Documentation Agents (each
a “ Titled Agent ”) in each such respective capacity, assumes no responsibility or obligation hereunder, including,
without limitation, for servicing, enforcement or collection of any of the Loans, nor any duties as an agent hereunder for the Lenders.
The titles given to the Titled Agents are solely honorific and imply no fiduciary responsibility on the part of the Titled Agents to
the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Borrower or any other Loan Party and the use of such titles does not impose on the Titled Agents
any duties or obligations greater than those of any other Lender or entitle the Titled Agents to any rights other than those to which
any other Lender is entitled.
Section 12.10.       Specified
Derivatives Contracts . No Specified Derivatives Provider that obtains the benefits of Section 11.5.
by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Loan Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object
to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of any Loan Document other than in its capacity as a
Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article to
the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been
made with respect to, Specified Derivatives Contracts unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Specified Derivatives
Contracts, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Specified Derivatives
Provider.
Section 12.11.       Erroneous
Payments .
(a)            Each
Lender, each other Lender Party and any other party hereto hereby severally agrees that if (i) the Administrative Agent notifies (which
such notice shall be conclusive absent manifest error) such Lender or any other Lender Party (or the Lender Affiliate of a Lender Party)
or any other Person that has received funds from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates, either for its own account or on
behalf of a Lender or other Lender Party (each such recipient, a “ Payment Recipient ”) that the Administrative Agent
has determined in its sole discretion that any funds received by such Payment Recipient were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise
erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Payment Recipient) or (ii) any Payment
Recipient receives any payment from the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than,
or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any
of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, as applicable, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied
by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment,
prepayment or repayment, as applicable, or (z) that such Payment Recipient otherwise becomes aware was transmitted or received in
error or by mistake (in whole or in part) then, in each case, an error in payment shall be presumed to have been made (any such amounts
specified in clauses (i) or (ii) of this Section 12.11(a), whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment
of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise; individually and collectively, an “ Erroneous Payment ”), then,
in each case, such Payment Recipient is deemed to have knowledge of such error at the time of its receipt of such Erroneous Payment;
 provided that nothing in this Section shall require the Administrative Agent to provide any of the notices specified in clauses
(i) or (ii) above. Each Payment Recipient agrees that it shall not assert any right or claim to any Erroneous Payment, and
hereby waives any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by
the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payments, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on “discharge
for value” or any similar doctrine.
(b)            Without
limiting the immediately preceding clause (a), each Payment Recipient agrees that, in the case of clause (a)(ii) above, it shall
promptly notify the Administrative Agent in writing of such occurrence.

(c)            In
the case of either clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of the Administrative
Agent and shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, and upon demand
from the Administrative Agent such Payment Recipient shall (or, shall cause any Person who received any portion of an Erroneous Payment
on its behalf to), promptly, but in all events no later than two Business Days thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount
of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in Same Day Funds and in the currency so received,
together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received
by such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and
a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time
in effect.
(d)            In
the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative Agent for any reason, after demand therefor
by the Administrative Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (c), from any Lender that is a Payment Recipient or an Affiliate
of a Payment Recipient (such unrecovered amount as to such Lender, an “ Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency ”), then
at the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and upon the Administrative Agent’s written notice to such Lender (i) such
Lender shall be deemed to have made a cashless assignment of the full face amount of the portion of its Loans (but not its Commitments)
of the relevant Class with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the “ Erroneous Payment Impacted Class ”)
to the Administrative Agent or, at the option of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent’s applicable lending affiliate,
in an amount that is equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify)
(such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class, the “ Erroneous Payment Deficiency
Assignment ”) plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such assigned amount, without further consent or approval of any party
hereto and without any payment by the Administrative Agent or its applicable lending affiliate as the assignee of such Erroneous Payment
Deficiency Assignment. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (1) any assignment contemplated in this clause (d) shall
be made without any requirement for any payment or other consideration paid by the applicable assignee or received by the assignor, (2) the
provisions of this clause (d) shall govern in the event of any conflict with the terms and conditions of Section 13.5. 
and (3) the Administrative Agent may reflect such assignments in the Register without further consent or action by any other Person.
(e)            Each
party hereto hereby agrees that (x) in the event an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered from any Payment Recipient
that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent (1) shall be subrogated to
all the rights of such Payment Recipient with respect to such amount and (2) is authorized to set off, net and apply any and all
amounts at any time owing to such Payment Recipient under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative
Agent to such Payment Recipient from any source, against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 12.11
 or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement, (y) the receipt of an Erroneous Payment by a Payment Recipient shall
not for the purpose of this Agreement be treated as a payment, prepayment, repayment, discharge or other satisfaction of any Obligations
owed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect
to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or any other
Loan Party for the purpose of making a payment on the Obligations and (z) to the extent that an Erroneous Payment was in any way
or at any time credited as payment or satisfaction of any of the Obligations, the Obligations or any part thereof that were so credited,
and all rights of the Payment Recipient, as the case may be, shall be reinstated and continue in full force and effect as if such payment
or satisfaction had never been received.

or discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.
(g)            Nothing
in this Section 12.11 will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of the Administrative Agent hereunder arising from
any Payment Recipient’s receipt of an Erroneous Payment.
(h)            Nothing
in this Section 12.11 shall be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect of increasing
(or accelerating the due date for), any Obligations of the Borrower relative to the amount (and/or timing for payment) of the Obligations
that would have been payable had an erroneous Payment not been made as described herein.

it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:
(i)            Minimum

any case not described in the immediately preceding subsection (A), the aggregate amount of the unfunded Commitment (if any) of

Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date) shall not be less than $5,000,000,
unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default shall exist, the Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided , however , that if, after giving effect to such assignment the amount
of the unfunded Commitment of the applicable Class and the outstanding principal balance of the Loans of the applicable Class of

not prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate Classes of Commitments or Loans
on a non-pro rata basis.
(iii)             Required
Consents . No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by clause (i)(B) of this subsection (b) and,
in addition:
(A)            the
consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default
shall exist at the time of such assignment or (y) such assignment is to a Lender of the same Class of Commitments or Loans,
an Affiliate of such a Lender or an Approved Fund of such a Lender; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented
to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after
having received notice thereof; and
(B)            the
consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless such assignment
is to a Lender of the same Class of Commitments or Loans, an Affiliate of such a Lender or an Approved Fund of such a Lender.
(iv)             Assignment
and Assumption; Notes . The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption,
together with a processing and recordation fee of $4,500 for each assignment (which fee the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion,
elect to waive), and the assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
If requested by the transferor Lender or the assignee, upon the consummation of any assignment, the transferor Lender, the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes are issued to the assignee and such transferor Lender, as
appropriate.

Assignment to Certain Persons . No such assignment shall be made to (A) the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates

(vii)             Certain
Additional Payments . In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment
shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall
make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate
(which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including
funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but
not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay
and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent and each other Lender hereunder
(and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans of the applicable
Class. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall
become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall
be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by
the Administrative Agent pursuant to the immediately following subsection (c), from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder
shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement,
such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 5.4., 13.2. and 13.9.
and the other provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as provided in Section 13.10. with respect to facts and
circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided , that except to the extent otherwise expressly
agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder
arising from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation
in such rights and obligations in accordance with the immediately following subsection (d).
(c)             Register .
The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Principal Office
a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders,
and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from
time to time (the “ Register ”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof
as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(d)             Participations .
Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any
Person (other than a natural person (or holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit
of, a natural person), a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “ Participant ”)
in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments
of any Class and/or the Loans of any Class owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance
of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly
with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant
to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and
to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument
may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to (w) increase such Lender’s Commitments,
(x) extend the date fixed for the payment of principal on the Loans or portions thereof owing to such Lender, (y) reduce the
rate at which interest is payable thereon (other than with respect to a waiver of implementation of interest at the Post-Default Rate)
or (z) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their Obligations under the Guaranty except as contemplated by Section 8.14.(b)(but,
for the avoidance of doubt, not including amendments or waivers of requirements to join additional Guarantors), in each case, as applicable
to that portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations that are subject to the participation. The Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.10., 5.1. and 5.4. (subject to the requirements and limitations therein,
including the requirements under Section 3.10.(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.10.(g) shall
be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant
to subsection (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of
Section 5.6. as if it were an assignee under subsection (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive
any greater payment under Section 5.1. or 3.10., with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been
entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Regulatory Change that occurs
after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request
and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 5.6. with respect
to any Participant. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 13.3.
as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.3. as though it were a Lender.
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register
on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s
interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “ Participant Register ”); provided 
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant
or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under
any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter
of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The
entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice
to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility
for maintaining a Participant Register.
(e)             Certain
Pledges . Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central
bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute
any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(f)             No
Registration . Each Lender agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, it will not
make any assignment hereunder in any manner or under any circumstances that would require registration or qualification of, or filings
in respect of, any Loan or Note under the Securities Act or any other securities laws of the United States of America or of any other
jurisdiction.

identification information as shall be necessary for the Administrative Agent to comply with federal law.

Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Lender and each Related Party of any of the foregoing
Persons (each such Person being called an “ Indemnified Party ”) against, and hold each Indemnified Party harmless from,
and shall pay or reimburse any such Indemnified Party for, any and all actual losses, claims (including without limitation, Environmental
Claims), damages, liabilities and related expenses (including without limitation, the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
for any Indemnified Party (subject to the limitations below)), incurred by any Indemnified Party or asserted against any Indemnified
Party by any Person (including the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary) other than such Indemnified Party and its
Related Parties, arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other
Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto or thereto of their
respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) any
Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials
on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary, or any Environmental Claim related
in any way to the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary, (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation
or proceeding (an “ Indemnity Proceeding ”) relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any
other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary, and regardless of whether
any Indemnified Party is a party thereto, or (v) any claim (including without limitation, any Environmental Claims), investigation,
litigation or other proceeding (whether or not the Administrative Agent or any Lender is a party thereto) and the prosecution and defense
thereof, arising out of or in any way connected with the Loans, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any documents contemplated
by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; provided , however , that such indemnity
shall not, as to any Indemnified Party, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses
(A) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith breach of direct funding obligations hereunder of such Indemnified Party or (B) result from a dispute
among Indemnified Parties (other than disputes involving the Administrative Agent, a Lead Arranger or other agent in its capacity or
in fulfilling its role as such and any claims arising out of any act or omission on the part of the Borrower or any Subsidiary); provided ,
 further , however , that legal fees and expenses shall be limited to the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, disbursements

taken as a whole, in each relevant jurisdiction and with respect to each relevant specialty, and in the case of an actual or perceived
conflict of interest, one additional primary counsel and one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction and with respect to each relevant
specialty to the similarly situated affected Indemnified Parties taken as a whole. This section shall not apply with respect to Taxes
other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims or damages arising from any non-Tax claim. Each Indemnified Party shall be obligated
to refund or return any amounts paid by the Borrower under this paragraph to such Indemnified Party to the extent such Indemnified Party
was not actually entitled to payment of such amounts in accordance with the terms hereof as determined by such Indemnified Party in its
sole discretion exercised in good faith.
(b)            If
and to the extent that the obligations of the Borrower under this Section are unenforceable for any reason, the Borrower hereby
agrees to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such obligations which is permissible under Applicable Law.
(c)            The
Borrower’s obligations under this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and
the payment in full in cash of the Obligations, and are in addition to, and not in substitution of, any of the other obligations set

as well as before and (ii) at all times after any such party ceases to be a party to this Agreement with respect to all matters
and events existing on or prior to the date such party ceased to be a party to this Agreement.
Section 13.11.       Severability
of Provisions . If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severed from the Loan Documents,
and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall remain in full force as though the invalid, illegal,
or unenforceable provision had never been part of the Loan Documents.

Section 13.21.       Acknowledgement
Regarding Any Supported QFCs . To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through
a guarantee or otherwise, for a Derivatives Contract or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “ QFC
Credit Support ” and each such QFC a “ Supported QFC ”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with
respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “ U.S.
Special Resolution Regimes ”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable
notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York
and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
In the event a Covered Entity
that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “ Covered Party ”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution
Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such
Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such
Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the
Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the
United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject
to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported
QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than
such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed
by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that
rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with
respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
