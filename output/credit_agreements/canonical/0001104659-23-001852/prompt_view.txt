⟦s001566⟧ The Administrative Agent may be removed as administrative agent by the Requisite Lenders (excluding for such purpose Loans and Commitments held by the Lender then acting as Administrative Agent) upon 30 days’ prior written notice if the Administrative Agent (i) is found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment to have committed gross negligence or willful misconduct in the course of performing its duties hereunder or (ii) the Lender then acting as Administrative Agent has become a Defaulting Lender under clause (d) of the definition of that term.
⟦s001567⟧ Upon any such resignation or removal, the Requisite Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which appointment shall, provided no Event of Default exists, be subject to the Borrower’s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, it being understood that the approval of the Borrower will not be required for a Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) or Affiliate of a Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) to become a successor Administrative Agent.
⟦s001568⟧ If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the current Administrative Agent’s giving of notice of resignation or having been removed, then, in the case of resignation by the Administrative Agent, the current Administrative Agent may, or in the case of removal of the Administrative Agent, the Requisite Lenders may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a Lender, if any Lender shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be an Eligible Assignee and in any case shall have an office in the United States; provided that if no Lender has accepted such appointment, then such resignation or removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made to each Lender directly, until such time as a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed as provided for above in this Section; provided , further that such Lenders so acting directly shall be and be deemed to be protected when so acting in such capacity by all indemnities and other provisions herein for the benefit and protection of the Administrative Agent as if each such Lender were itself the Administrative Agent.
⟦s001569⟧ Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the current Administrative Agent, and the current Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents.
⟦s001570⟧ After any Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article XII. shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents.

⟦s001582⟧ Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Specified Derivatives Contracts unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Specified Derivatives Contracts, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Specified Derivatives Provider.

⟦s001879⟧ Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
