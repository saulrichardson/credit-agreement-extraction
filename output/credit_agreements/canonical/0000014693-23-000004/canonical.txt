The Borrower, the Lenders, and the Administrative Agent have entered into this Agreement in order to set forth the terms and conditions under which the Lenders will, from time to time, make loans and extend other financial accommodations to or for the benefit of the Borrower.

“ Affiliate ” means, with respect to a specified Person, another Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with the Person specified.
“ Alternate Base Rate ” means, for any day, a rate of interest per annum equal to the highest of (a) zero percent, (b) the Prime Rate for such day, (c) the sum of the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day plus 0.50% per annum and (d) the Adjusted Term SOFR Screen Rate (without giving effect to the Applicable Rate) for a one-month Interest Period on such day (or if such day is not a Business Day or if the Term SOFR Screen Rate for such Business Day is not published due to a holiday or other circumstance that the Administrative Agent deems in its sole discretion to be temporary, the immediately preceding Business Day) for Dollars plus 1.00%. Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, or the Adjusted Term SOFR Screen Rate shall be effective from the effective date of such change. If the Alternate Base Rate is being used when Term SOFR Borrowings are unavailable pursuant to Section 2.13(c) or 2.14, then the Alternate Base Rate shall be the highest of clauses (a), (b) and (c) above, without reference to clause (d) above.
“ Anti-Corruption Laws ” means all laws, rules, and regulations of any jurisdiction applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries from time to time concerning or relating to bribery or corruption.
“ Applicable Percentage ” means, with respect to any Lender, the percentage of the total Commitments represented by such Lender’s Commitment; provided , that when a Defaulting Lender shall exist, “Applicable Percentage” shall mean the percentage of the total Commitments (disregarding any
DB1/ 133837500.10
Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) represented by such Lender’s Commitment. If the Commitments have terminated or expired, the Applicable Percentages shall be determined based upon the Commitments most recently in effect, giving effect to any assignments.
“ Applicable Rate ” means, for any day, with respect to any Term SOFR Loan, the applicable rate per annum set forth below under the caption “Term SOFR Margin” based upon the ratings by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch, respectively, applicable on such date to the Index Debt on such date:
Ratings (S&P/Moody’s/Fitch) Term SOFR Margin (% per annum) Category 1 > AA-/Aa3/AA- 0.50% Category 2 A+/A1/A+ 0.625% Category 3 A/A2/A 0.750% Category 4 A-/A3/A- 0.875% Category 5 < BBB+/Baa1/BBB+ 1.000%
For purposes of the foregoing:
(i) if two or more of Moody’s, S&P or Fitch shall not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the circumstances referred to below), then such rating agency shall be deemed to have established a rating in Category 5;
(ii) if the Company receives two or more ratings and they are the same, or if the Company receives two ratings that are the same, and a third rating that is lower than the first two ratings, then, in each case, the Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the two or more ratings that are the same;
(iii) if the Company only receives two ratings and they are not the same, or if the Company receives two ratings that are the same, and a third rating that is higher, then the higher rating shall apply for purposes of determining the Applicable Rate. However, if the lower rating is two or more Categories below the higher rating, the Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the Category next above that of the lower of the ratings;
(iv) if all three of the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch for the Index Debt are different, the Applicable Rate shall be based on (x) the highest of the three ratings if the highest rating and the next highest rating only differ by one rating or (y) the average of the two highest ratings (computed based on their corresponding Categories) if they differ by two or more ratings. However, if the average does not fall in a recognized Category (for example, Category 2.5), then the Applicable Rate shall be based on the rating one rating below the highest rating; and
(v) if the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody’s, S&P and/or Fitch for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of Moody’s, S&P or Fitch), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first publicly announced by the applicable rating agency.
Each change in the Applicable Rate shall apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next
2
such change. If the rating system of Moody’s, S&P or Fitch shall change, or if a rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, or if Company notifies the Administrative Agent in writing that it elects to have another rating agency other than Moody’s, S&P or Fitch rate its debt, the Company and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system, the unavailability of ratings from such rating agency or the replacement rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Rate shall be determined by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.
“ Assignment and Assumption ” means an Assignment and Assumption entered into by a Lender and an assignee (with the consent of any party whose consent is required by Section 10.04), and accepted by the Administrative Agent, in the form of Exhibit A or any other form approved by the Administrative Agent.

In the case of any lease which is terminable by the lessee upon payment of a penalty, the Attributable Debt shall be the lesser of the Attributable Debt determined assuming termination upon the first date such lease may be terminated (in which case the Attributable Debt shall also include the amount of the penalty, but no rent shall be considered as required to be paid under such lease subsequent to the first date upon which it may be so terminated) or the Attributable Debt determined assuming no such termination.
“ Availability Period ” means the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the earlier of the sixtieth day to occur after the Effective Date and the date of termination of the Commitments.

(1)    Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment; or
3
(2)    the sum of: (a) the alternate benchmark rate that has been selected by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower as the replacement for the then-current Benchmark for the applicable Corresponding Tenor giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a replacement benchmark rate or the mechanism for determining such a rate by the Relevant Governmental Body or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a benchmark rate as a replacement for the then-current Benchmark for U.S. dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities at such time and (b) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment.

Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. The words “include”, “includes” and “including” shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase “without limitation”. The word “will” shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word “shall”. Unless the context requires otherwise (a) any definition of or reference to any agreement, instrument or other document herein shall be construed as referring to such agreement, instrument or other document as from time to time amended, supplemented or otherwise modified (subject to any restrictions on such amendments, supplements or modifications set forth herein), (b) any reference herein to any Person shall be construed to include such Person’s successors and assigns, (c) the words “herein”, “hereof” and “hereunder”, and words of similar import, shall be construed to refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not to any particular provision hereof, (d) all references herein to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules shall be construed to refer to Articles and Sections of, and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement and (e) the words “asset” and “property” shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect and to refer to any and all tangible and intangible assets and properties, including cash, securities, accounts and contract rights.

SECTION 1.05     Term SOFR Notification . The interest rate on Term SOFR Borrowings is determined by reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR Screen Rate, which is derived from Term SOFR. Section 2.14(b) provides a mechanism for (a) determining an alternative rate of interest if Term SOFR is no longer available or in the other circumstances set forth in Section 2.14(b), and (b) modifying this Agreement to give effect to such alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration,
18
submission or any other matter related to Term SOFR or other rates in the definition of Term SOFR Rate or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including any Benchmark Replacement), including without limitation, whether any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate (including any Benchmark Replacement), as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.14(b), will have the same value as, or be economically equivalent to, Term SOFR. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of Alternate Base Rate, Term SOFR, the Term SOFR Rate, any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain the Alternate Base Rate, the Term SOFR Rate, Term SOFR or any other Benchmark, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.

If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be a Term SOFR Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month’s duration. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Term SOFR Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.

(b)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Overnight Rate and a rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the subject Loan pursuant to Section 2.13 (it being understood that nothing in this paragraph shall require the Borrower to pay any interest in duplication of the interest payable under such Section).

An Electing Lender shall have twenty (20) days from the date on which such Change in Control occurs (such twenty-day period, the “ Commitment Termination Election Period ”) to deliver such notice to the Administrative Agent and the Company. A Lender that does not deliver such a notice by the end of the Commitment Termination Election Period
22

(i)    for any reason in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Borrowing or a conversion or continuation thereof that the Adjusted Term SOFR Screen Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Borrowing does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of the funding such Loans, or
(ii)    the interest rate applicable to Term SOFR Borrowings for any requested Interest Period is not ascertainable or available (including, without limitation, because the applicable Screen (or on any successor or substitute page on such screen) is unavailable) and such inability to ascertain or unavailability is not expected to be permanent,

During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Alternate Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Alternate Base Rate.

(a)    If, after the date of this Agreement (or with respect to any Lender, if later, the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender), there occurs any adoption of or change in any law, governmental rule, regulation, treaty, policy, guideline, interpretation, or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or in the interpretation, promulgation, implementation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, including, notwithstanding the foregoing, all requests, rules, guidelines or directives (i) in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or (ii) promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States financial regulatory
26
authorities, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued, promulgated or implemented (any of the foregoing, a “ Change in Law ”) which:
(i)    subjects any Lender or any applicable lending office or the Administrative Agent to any Taxes (other than with respect to Indemnified Taxes, Excluded Taxes, and Other Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto, or
(ii)    imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity or similar requirement (including any compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any applicable lending office, or
(iii)    imposes on any Lender or the applicable interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender,
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or the Administrative Agent of making, continuing, converting into or maintaining its Loans or Commitment or to reduce the return received by such Lender or the Administrative Agent in connection with such Loans or Commitment, then, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender or the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction in amount received.
(b)    If a Lender reasonably determines the amount of capital or liquidity required to be maintained by such Lender, any lending office of such Lender, or any corporation or holding company controlling such Lender is increased as a result of a Change in Law, then, within fifteen (15) days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital or liquidity which such Lender reasonably determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Term Loan Credit Exposure or its Commitment to make Loans hereunder (after taking into account such Lender’s policies as to capital or liquidity adequacy), in each case that is attributable to such Change in Law.
(c)    [Reserved].
(d)    A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and the manner in which such amount or amounts have been determined and showing the calculations made, shall be delivered to the Company and shall be presumed correct absent manifest error. The Company shall pay or cause the Borrower to pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(e)    Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 120 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Company of the Change in Law or other circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law or other circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 120-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
(f)    Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Section 2.15, no Lender shall request that the Borrower pay any additional amount pursuant to this Section 2.15 unless it generally is or shall be making similar requests from other similarly situated borrowers from whom such Lender is permitted, under contract and applicable law, to seek similar amounts.
SECTION 2.16     Break Funding Payments . In the event of (i) the payment of any principal of any Term SOFR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or an optional or mandatory prepayment of Loans), (ii) the
27
conversion of any Term SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (iii) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Term SOFR Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11 and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (iv) the assignment of any Term SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19 , then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Term SOFR Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (x) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted Term SOFR Screen Rate that would have been applicable in determining the Term SOFR Rate for such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (y) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in US Dollars of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for US Dollars, whether or not such Term SOFR Loan was in fact so funded. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
SECTION 2.17     Taxes . (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any tax from any such payment by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, then the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such tax is an Indemnified Tax or Other Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions or withholdings (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, the applicable Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made.
(b)    In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c)    The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be presumed correct absent manifest error.
(d)    As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. In addition, any Lender, if
28
reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Each Lender shall promptly notify the Company at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any such previously delivered documentation to the Company.
(f)    If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be subject to withholding tax imposed by the United States of America with respect to FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(f), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(g)    If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
SECTION 2.18     Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs . (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or otherwise) prior to the time required hereunder for such payment or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 1:00 p.m., Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders to such account as the Administrative Agent shall from time to time specify in one or more notices delivered to the Company, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of principal or interest in respect of any Loan shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made in the currency of such Loan; all other payments hereunder and under each other document related hereto shall be made in US Dollars. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment
29
in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.
(b)    If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c)    If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(d)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each applicable Lender severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.
(e)    If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.06(b), 2.18(d) or 10.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.19     Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)    (i) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15 (including any Lender that requests compensation under Section 2.15 in connection with reserves not taken into account in
30
determining the interest rate applicable to Term SOFR Loans), (ii) if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or (iii) if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Declining Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04, however, the Company shall be obligated to pay any applicable recordation or processing fee) all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts), and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments; provided , further , that if within ten (10) Business Days following a request by the Company for such Lender to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption, such Lender does not respond to such request or refuses to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption, the validity of the removal of such Lender and the assignment to the assignee shall nevertheless be effective so long as such assignment otherwise satisfies the requirements set forth in Section 10.04(b). A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 2.20     [Intentionally Omitted] .
SECTION 2.21     Defaulting Lenders . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a)    [Intentionally Omitted];
(b)    the Commitment and Term Loan Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder; and
(c)    any amount payable to such Defaulting Lender hereunder (whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise and including any amount that would otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.18 but excluding Section 2.19) shall, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting Lender, be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated account and, subject to any applicable requirements of law, be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent (i) first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder, (ii) second, to the funding of any Loan which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent, (iii) third, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent, (iv) fourth, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy future funding obligations of the Defaulting Lender under this Agreement and, (v) fifth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement, (vi) sixth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement, (vii) seventh, if so determined by the Administrative Agent, distributed to the Lenders other than the Defaulting Lender until the ratio of the Term Loan Credit Exposure of such Lenders to the aggregate Term Loan Credit Exposure of all Lenders equals such ratio immediately prior to the Defaulting Lender’s failure to fund any portion of any Loans and (viii) eighth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided , that if such payment is a prepayment of the principal amount of any Loans, such
31
payment shall be applied solely to prepay the Loans of all Lenders that are not Defaulting Lenders pro rata prior to being applied to the prepayment of any Loans owed to any Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrower each agree that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold the Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender.
Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Borrower of any of its rights or remedies (whether in equity or law) against any Lender which fails to fund any of its Loans hereunder at the time or in the amount required to be funded under the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII The Administrative Agent
Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article (other than the sixth and seventh paragraphs of this Article set forth below) are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.

The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not

the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have no knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Administrative Agent.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Company. The Administrative Agent may be removed at any time that it constitutes a Defaulting Lender by written notice received by the Administrative Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal to be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Company shall have the right, in consultation with the Required Lenders, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Company and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees
44
payable by the Company to the successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of the retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as the Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
None of the Lenders, if any, identified in this Agreement as a Co-Syndication Agent or a Documentation Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to the relevant Lenders in their respective capacities as Co-Syndication Agents or Documentation Agent, as applicable, as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in the preceding paragraph.
The Lenders are not partners or co-venturers, and no Lender shall be liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth herein in case of the Administrative Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender. The Administrative Agent shall have the exclusive right on behalf of the Lenders to enforce the payment of the principal of and interest on any Loan after the date such principal or interest has become due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.02     Waivers; Amendments . (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
46
any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
(b)    Subject to Section 2.14(b), neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Company and the Required Lenders or by the Company and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender (it being understood and agreed that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in Section 4.02 or of any Default or a mandatory reduction in Commitments is not considered an extension in Commitments of any Lender), (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, including the Maturity Date without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, (iv) reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby; provided that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to reduce or waive any obligation of the Borrower to pay interest or fees at the applicable default rate set forth in Section 2.13(c), (v) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder (excluding any mandatory or voluntary prepayments), or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, (vi) change Section 2.08(c) or Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of Commitment reductions or payments required thereby, as the case may be, without the written consent of each Lender, or (vii) change any of the provisions of this Section 10.02(b) or the definition of “Required Lenders” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby; provided further that no Defaulting Lender shall have a consent right with respect to clauses (iv) through (vii) above unless, with respect to clauses (iv) through (vi), such change would impact such Defaulting Lender more adversely than all other Lenders affected thereby, and with respect to clause (vii), such change would impact such Defaulting Lender more adversely than all other Lenders; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.
(c)    If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of “each Lender” or “each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby,” the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is necessary but not obtained being referred to herein as a “ Non-Consenting Lender ”), then the Company may elect to replace a Non-Consenting Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the outstanding principal amount of the Loans, accrued interest and accrued fees due to the Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Non-Consenting Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of clause (b) of Section 10.04, and (ii) the Company shall pay to such Non-Consenting Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (1) all amounts (other than principal and accrued interest) then accrued but unpaid to such Non-Consenting Lender by the Company hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such Non-Consenting Lender under Sections 2.15 and 2.17, if any, and (2) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 2.16 had the Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender; provided , that if within ten (10) Business Days following a request by the Company for such Non-Consenting Lender to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption, such Non-Consenting Lender does not respond to such request or refuses to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption, the validity of the removal of such Non-Consenting Lender and the assignment to the
47
assignee shall nevertheless be effective so long as such assignment otherwise satisfies the requirements set forth in Section 10.04(b).
(d)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein the Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Company only, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency. The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of any such executed amendment, modification or supplement.
SECTION 10.03     Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver .

(b)    The Company shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “ Indemnitee ”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including, subject to the remainder hereof, the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the Commitments, any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not such claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding is brought by the Company or its equity holders, Affiliates, creditors or any other third Person and whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (1) the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee (or any Related Party of such Indemnitee that is involved in the transactions evidenced hereby) or (2) a material breach by such Indemnitee (or any Related Party of such Indemnitee that is involved in the transactions evidenced hereby) of its obligations under this Agreement, (y) arise out of a dispute among Indemnitees (other than a dispute involving claims against an Indemnitee
48
in its capacity as Administrative Agent, lead arranger or any other arranger, agent or co-agent (if any) designated with respect to this Agreement) or (z) result from an Indemnitee entering into a settlement agreement where (i) the aggregate amount of payments to be made by such Indemnitee in connection therewith equals or exceeds $1,000,000 and (ii) the Company has not provided prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to such settlement (it being agreed that to the extent any such payments are reasonably anticipated to be less than $1,000,000, such Indemnitee shall nevertheless consult with the Company for a reasonable period of time prior to entering into to any such settlement); provided , further , that in the case of counsel, such expense reimbursement shall be limited to (i) the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees, charges and disbursements of one primary counsel for the Indemnitees, taken as a whole, (ii) if necessary, one local counsel in each relevant material jurisdiction for the Indemnitees, taken as a whole, and (iii) one additional counsel in light of actual or potential conflicts of interest for the Indemnitees, taken as a whole. The foregoing provisions of this Section 10.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Excluded Taxes or Indemnified Taxes other than Taxes that represent losses, claims, or damages, etc., arising from or related to a non-Tax claim and yield protection matters, which shall be governed exclusively by Sections 2.15 and 2.17.
(c)    To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section (and without limiting its obligation to do so), each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.
(d)    To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and the Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee (i) for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet), other than damages resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, or (ii) on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.
(e)    All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.
SECTION 10.04     Successors and Assigns . (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Company, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.04(a) (so long as any surviving entity of any merger or consolidation shall have assumed all applicable obligations hereunder), may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b)    Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (other than an Ineligible Institution or a Competitor) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment by a Lender to a Lender Affiliate of such Lender, the Administrative Agent must give its prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, the Company must give its prior written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided , that the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received notice thereof; (iii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment, the amount of the
49
Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than US$5,000,000 unless each of the Company and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iv) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of US$3,500, and (vi) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and provided further that any consent of the Company otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be required if an Event of Default under paragraph (a), (b), (h), (i) or (j) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “Ineligible Institution” shall have the following meaning:
“ Ineligible Institution ” means (a) a natural person, (b) a Defaulting Lender or its parent company, (c) the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates, or (d) a company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural person or relative(s) thereof.
(c)    The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York, New York a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “ Register ”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d)    Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(e)    Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company (a “ Participant ”), other than an Ineligible Institution or a Competitor, in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
50
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant so long as such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 10.02(c) as if it were an assignee under Section 10.04(b). Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section so long as such Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 2.19 as if it were an assignee under Section 10.04(b). To the extent permitted by law and if prior written notice of the sale of the participation to the Participant is provided to the Company, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “ Participant Register ”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans, or its other obligations under this Agreement) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(f)    A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company’s prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Company is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Company, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.
(g)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
