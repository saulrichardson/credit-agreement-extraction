⟦s001293⟧ (f) For purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the annual rates of interest or fees to which the rates of interest or fees provided in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (and stated herein or therein, as applicable, to be computed on the basis of 360 days or any other period of time less than a calendar year) are equivalent are the rates so determined multiplied by the actual number of days in the applicable calendar year and divided by 360 or such other period of time, respectively.
⟦s001294⟧ (g) If any provision of this Agreement or other Loan Document would oblige any Canadian Loan Party to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to any Lender in an amount or calculated at a rate which would be prohibited by law or would result in a receipt by that Lender of “interest” at a “criminal rate” (as such terms are construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)), then, notwithstanding such provision, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by applicable law or so result in a receipt by that Lender of “interest” at a “criminal rate”, such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary (but only to the extent necessary), by reducing the amount or rate of interest, and, thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, costs, expenses, premiums and other amounts required to be paid to the affected Lender which would constitute interest for purposes of section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada).
⟦s001295⟧ Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all adjustments contemplated thereby, if a Lender shall have received an amount in excess of the maximum permitted by section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada), the applicable Canadian Loan Party shall be entitled to obtain reimbursement from such Lender in an amount equal to such excess and, pending such reimbursement, such amount shall be deemed to be an amount payable by such Lender to such Canadian Loan Party.

⟦s002416⟧ (cz) The obligation of the Loan Parties in respect of any sum due from them to any Lender hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “ Judgment Currency ”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the “ Agreement Currency ”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency such Lender may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender in the Agreement Currency, the Company agrees notwithstanding any such judgment to indemnify such Lender against such loss, and if the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to any Lender, such Lender agrees to remit to the Company or other applicable Loan Party such excess.

⟦s002422⟧ This Section 17.1 is included in this Agreement solely for the purpose of ensuring the validity and effect of certain security rights governed by the laws of the Netherlands, Poland and Germany granted or to be granted pursuant to the applicable Collateral Documents and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not limit the rights and remedies provided to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent by the other provisions hereof and the provisions of the other Loan Documents.
⟦s002423⟧ (a) Each of the Loan Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally undertakes to pay to the Collateral Agent as creditor in its own right and not as a representative of the other Secured Parties amounts equal to any amounts owing from time to time by that Loan Party to any Secured Party under any Loan Document as and when those amounts are due for payment under the relevant Loan Document (each such payment undertaking of a Loan Party in relation to any individual Secured Party, a “ Parallel Debt Undertaking ”, and all Parallel Debt Undertakings of each Loan Party taken together, its “ Parallel Debt ”).
⟦s002424⟧ (b) Each of the Loan Parties and the Collateral Agent acknowledge that the obligations of each Loan Party under any Parallel Debt Undertaking are several and are separate and independent from, and shall not in any way limit or affect, the obligations of that Loan Party to that relevant Secured Party under any Loan Document that corresponds to the relevant Parallel Debt Undertaking (its “ Corresponding Debt ”) nor shall the amounts for which each Loan Party is liable under any Parallel Debt Undertaking be limited or affected in any way by its Corresponding Debt provided that:
⟦s002425⟧ (xvi) the Collateral Agent shall not demand payment with regard to the Parallel Debt Undertaking of a

⟦s002427⟧ (xvii) a Secured Party shall not demand payment with regard to the Corresponding Debt of a Loan Party to the extent that such Loan Party’s Parallel Debt Undertaking has been irrevocably paid or (in the case of guarantee obligations) discharged.
⟦s002428⟧ (xviii) each Parallel Debt Undertaking shall cover, in an anticipatory manner as to its scope, any future changes in the relevant Corresponding Debt, in particular any such changes resulting from any future increase of any loan or note facility, any future extension of the agreed maturity thereof or any future change of the interest rate charged thereunder;
⟦s002429⟧ (xix) each Parallel Debt Undertaking shall be due and payable at any time from the date of this Agreement in an amount which equals the amount and currency or currencies of the relevant Corresponding Debt that is due and payable at the same time as the relevant Corresponding Debt; and
⟦s002430⟧ (xx) each Parallel Debt Undertaking shall remain effective notwithstanding any transfer or assumption of its Corresponding Debt in whole or in part to or by any third party, irrespective of whether any such transfer or assumption is effected by way of assignment or assignment and transfer by way of assumption of contract or otherwise.
⟦s002431⟧ (c) The Collateral Agent acts in its own name and not as a trustee, and its claims in respect of the Parallel Debt shall not be held on trust.
⟦s002432⟧ The Collateral under the Collateral Documents granted under the Loan Documents to the Collateral Agent to secure the Parallel Debt Undertakings is granted to the Collateral Agent in its capacity as creditor of each Parallel Debt Undertaking and shall not be held on trust.
⟦s002433⟧ (d) All monies received or recovered by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section 17.1 , and all amounts received or recovered by the Collateral Agent from or by the enforcement of any collateral under the Collateral Documents granted to secure any Parallel Debt Undertaking, shall be applied in accordance with this Agreement.
⟦s002434⟧ (e) Without limiting or affecting the Collateral Agent’s rights against the Loan Parties (whether under this Section 17.1 or under any other provision of the Loan Documents), each Lender acknowledges that:
⟦s002435⟧ (xxi) nothing in this Section 17.1 shall impose any obligation on the Collateral Agent to advance any sum to any Lender or otherwise under any Loan Document, except in its capacity as lender; and
⟦s002436⟧ (xxii) for the purpose of any vote taken under any Loan Document, the Collateral Agent shall not be regarded as having any participation or commitment other than those which it has in its capacity as a lender.
⟦s002437⟧ (xxiii) For purposes of any Dutch Collateral Document, any resignation by Collateral Agent is not effective with respect to its rights under the Parallel Debt until all rights and obligations under the Parallel Debt have been assigned to and assumed by the successor agent appointed in accordance with this Agreement.
⟦s002438⟧ 100 #96397435v19
⟦s002439⟧ (f) The Collateral Agent will reasonably cooperate in transferring its rights and obligations under the Parallel Debt to a successor agent in accordance with this Agreement and will reasonably cooperate in transferring all rights and obligations under any Collateral Document to such successor agent.
⟦s002440⟧ All parties to this Agreement hereby, in advance, irrevocably grant their cooperation ( medewerking ) to such transfers of rights and obligations by the Common Security Agent to a successor agent in accordance this Agreement.
⟦s002441⟧ (g) The provisions of this Section 17.1 may not apply for any Security Documents governed by French law.
⟦s002442⟧ 17.10.
⟦s002443⟧ Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions .

⟦s002449⟧ (xxvi) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.
⟦s002450⟧ 17.11.
⟦s002451⟧ Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs .
⟦s002452⟧ To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support,
⟦s002453⟧ through a guarantee or otherwise, for any agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support “ QFC Credit Support ” and each such QFC, a “ Supported QFC ”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “ U.S. Special Resolution Re g imes ”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
⟦s002454⟧ If a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “ Covered Party ”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a
⟦s002455⟧ U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
⟦s002456⟧ In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
⟦s002457⟧ Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

⟦s002466⟧ 101 #96397435v19
⟦s002467⟧ Each Spanish Public Document will:
⟦s002468⟧ (a) have the effects established under articles 517 et seq. of the Spanish Civil Procedure Law; and
⟦s002469⟧ (b) may, at the decision of the Administrative Agent, include a translation into Spanish of this Clause 17.5 ( Spanish law provisions ).
⟦s002470⟧ Each party hereby expressly authorises the Administrative Agent (and any other Finance Party, as appropriate) to request and obtain from the Spanish notary public before whom any Loan Document has been formalised, any further copy of any Loan Document notarised at the cost of the requesting party.
⟦s002471⟧ 17.1.1 Spanish Civil Procedure
⟦s002472⟧ For the purposes of Article 572.2 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Law, all Parties expressly agree that the exact amount due at any time by the Company to the Lenders under the Loan Documents will be the amount specified in a certificate issued by the Administrative Agent (and/or any Lender) and will be based on the accounts maintained by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement.
⟦s002473⟧ For such purposes:
⟦s002474⟧ (c) the Administrative Agent, acting in such capacity, will open and will keep in its books a special internal account in the name of the Company, into which the Administrative Agent will debit the amounts for principal, interest (including default interest), fees, costs, expenses and other sums owed by the Company under this Agreement, and shall credit into such account all sums received by the Administrative Agent in payment of the amounts owed by the Company under this Agreement, so that the balance of the said account shall at all times reflect the amounts owed by the Company under this Agreement:
⟦s002475⟧ (d) in addition to the account referred to in the preceding paragraph, each of the Lenders will open and will keep on its books a special internal account to that described in the above-mentioned paragraph, in which the Lender concerned will reflect the amounts owed thereto by the Company under this Agreement, as well as the amounts paid therein by the Company, in order that the balance of such account at all times reflects the sums owed by the Company to the relevant Lender under this Agreement.
⟦s002476⟧ It is expressly agreed that, for the purposes of any judicial enforcement procedure against the Company or any Spanish Loan Party, any amounts owed to the Administrative Agent or to any of the Lenders will be deemed to be an amount due, liquid and payable ( importe líquido y exigible ).
⟦s002477⟧ For the purposes of article 572.2 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Law, the parties agree that the amount claimable in the event of enforcement will be the amount calculated by the Administrative Agent (or by the Lenders concerned), as set out in the preceding paragraphs.
⟦s002478⟧ In this regard, the parties expressly acknowledge that the issue by the Administrative Agent of a certificate relating to the accounts referred to above shall preclude the subsequent issue by any of the Lenders of any certificate relating to its accounts, and that likewise the issue by any of the Lenders of any certificate relating to its account shall preclude the issue by the Administrative Agent of a certificate relating to the account of such Lender, except in the latter case where the necessary entries have been made in the relevant account in order to deduct the amounts certified individually by a Lender.
⟦s002479⟧ The parties hereby agree that it in order to initiate executive enforcement proceedings in Spain against any of the Company and/or Guarantors under article 517 et seq of the Spanish Civil Procedure Law it shall be sufficient (i) to establish the amount due and payable in accordance with the preceding paragraphs by the Administrative Agent, or any of the Lenders; (ii) to attach to this document both the certificate referred to in article 517.5 of the Spanish Civil Procedure Law and the settlement referred to in article 572.2 of the same law establishing the amounts claimed, together with a certificate issued by a Notary declaring that such sum claim conforms to the balance appearing on the aforementioned accounts; and (iii) that the settlement was prepared in the manner agreed by the parties in this Agreement.

⟦s002485⟧ 102 #96397435v19
⟦s002486⟧ 17.1.4 Spanish law personal guarantee provisions
⟦s002487⟧ Any personal guarantee granted under this Agreement or in accordance with it by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Spain will not extend to include any obligations or liabilities if to do so would cause a breach of the financial assistance prohibitions contained in articles 143 and 150 of the Spanish Companies Act.
⟦s002488⟧ Each Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Spain acknowledges that any personal guarantee granted under this Agreement or in accordance with it must be construed as a first demand guarantee ( garantía a primer requerimiento ) and not as a performance bond ( fianza ) and, therefore, the benefits of preference ( exclusión ), order ( orden ) and division ( division ) shall not be applicable.
⟦s002489⟧ 17.14.
⟦s002490⟧ Preservation of Belgian Collateral Documents .
⟦s002491⟧ If any of the Secured Parties’ rights and/or obligations under any of the Loan Documents are transferred or deemed to be transferred by way of novation, the rights and prerogatives under the Belgian Collateral Documents shall be maintained in favour of the transferee and the remaining Secured Parties, in accordance with Article 1278 of the Belgian Civil Code.

⟦s002507⟧ (f) Each Secured Party which becomes a party to this Agreement ratifies and approves all acts and declarations previously done by the Collateral Agent on such Secured Party’s behalf (including, for the avoidance of doubt the declarations made by the Collateral Agent as representative without power of attorney ( Vertreter ohne Vertretungsmacht ) in relation to the creation of any pledge ( Pfandrecht ) on behalf and for the benefit of each Secured Party as future pledgee or otherwise).

⟦s002788⟧ The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any security taken in connection with the Loans (or any refinancing thereof):
⟦s002789⟧ (t) security will be ranking in accordance with the lien priorities in any applicable Intercreditor Agreement;
⟦s002790⟧ (u) security will, to the extent possible under local law, not be enforceable until the occurrence of a Default (an “ Applicable Event ”) which is continuing (and, with respect to security governed by the laws of the Netherlands, constitutes a default in the performance of the secured obligations);
⟦s002791⟧ (v) with respect to security interests granted by an Italian Loan Party (or governed by Italian law) and a Spanish Loan Party, Applicable Event will be a payment default or the acceleration of the relevant secured obligations;

⟦s002793⟧ 3 #96339085v15
⟦s002794⟧ (x) the security documents should only operate to create security rather than to impose new commercial obligations or repeat clauses in other Loan Documents; accordingly:
⟦s002795⟧ (i) they should not contain identical or additional representations, undertakings or indemnities (including in respect of insurance, information, maintenance or protection of assets or the payment of fees, costs and expenses) unless required for the creation or perfection of security, to maintain effective security or customary in the relevant jurisdiction;
⟦s002796⟧ (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any security document, the terms of a security document shall not operate or be construed so as to prohibit or restrict any transaction, matter or other step permitted by the Loan Documents or where the applicable level of creditor consent required by the relevant Loan Document (“ Required Creditor Consent ”) has been obtained and the Collateral Agent shall (pursuant to its authority under Section 11.9 of the Agreement), upon the reasonable request of a Foreign Loan Party that grants Collateral (a “ Chargor ”) promptly following receipt of an officer’s certificate to the extent requested by the Collateral Agent, enter into such documentation and/or take such other action as is required by a Chargor (acting reasonably) in order to facilitate any such transaction, matter or other step, including by way of executing any confirmation, consent to dealing, release or other similar or equivalent document, provided that any costs and expenses incurred by the Collateral Agent entering into such documentation and/or taking such other action at the request of such Chargor pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of such Chargor, in accordance with the costs and expenses provisions set out in the Agreement and such provision shall be included in each security document; and

⟦s002801⟧ person having prior rights over any such assets; any such release, reassignment, retransfer, cancellation or termination is made in whole or in part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then such security or guarantee will continue or be reinstated as if the release, reassignment, retransfer, cancellation or termination had not occurred;
⟦s002802⟧ (aa) unless required by local law or customary in the relevant jurisdiction, the circumstances in which the Collateral shall be released should not be dealt with in individual security documents but, if so required, shall, except to the extent required by local law, be the same as those set out in the Loan Documents;
⟦s002803⟧ (ab) other than in each case of any German law share pledge agreement, each security document must contain a clause which records that if there is a conflict between the security document, the Agreement or any applicable Intercreditor Agreement then (to the fullest extent permitted by law) the provisions of the Agreement and the applicable Intercreditor Agreement will take priority over the provisions of the security document unless and to the extent it would prejudice the legality, creation, priority, perfection, validity or enforceability of such security document or the security created under or pursuant to the security document, save with respect to the release of the security interests where applicable law and market practice require certain additional steps in order to address local law claw back issues (e.g. comfort documents);
⟦s002804⟧ (ac) each of the security documents will, to the extent possible under local law, include a provision that provides that (i) all rights, protections, limitations on liability, exculpations and indemnifications provided or otherwise afforded to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent under the Agreement, including, without limitation Article XI and Section 10.6 of the Agreement shall apply in all respects to the Collateral Agent as chargee, security trustee or pledgee under the applicable security document, (ii) the applicable security document shall be subject to the provisions of Section 10.6 of the Agreement, which provisions shall apply to the applicable security document mutatis mutandis as though fully set forth therein, with each reference to the Borrower or Company, as applicable, being read to include the applicable chargor or pledgor, (iii) the Collateral Agent may act and exercise rights under the applicable security document, but shall not be obligated to act or exercise rights under the applicable security documents (and shall not incur liability for failure to act or exercise rights) unless directed in writing by the Required Lenders; provided that the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action or exercise any right that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may lead it to expend its own funds or expose the Collateral Agent to liability (financial or otherwise) or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable laws (for the avoidance of doubt, the Collateral Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions of any Lender or group of Lenders until it has received any indemnification and/or security that it may in its discretion require (which may be greater in extent than that contained in the Loan Documents and which may include payment in advance) for any cost, loss or liability which it may incur in complying with those instructions);
⟦s002805⟧ (ad) subject to (or to the extent permitted by) the applicable law and in accordance with market practice, the terms of the security documents shall secure the Obligations as such Obligations (and/or the Agreement or other Loan Documents) (or, where relevant, parallel debt derived therefrom) may be amended, amended and restated, restated, supplemented, replaced, renewed, restructured, extended, refunded, refinanced or otherwise modified from time to time (including without limitation, where such transactions result in any increases or decreases of the principal amount of the Obligations, any extensions of maturity, any changes in interest rates or other economic

⟦s002813⟧ (i) has the effect of changing the rights of such shares or of any related rights with respect to such shares, unless specifically permitted by the Agreement; or
⟦s002814⟧ (ii) adversely affects the validity or enforceability of such share security or causes a Default to occur, or is otherwise materially prejudicial to the interests of the Collateral Agent and/or the Secured Parties.

⟦s002871⟧ Additional Principles
⟦s002872⟧ These Agreed Security Principles embody the recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining effective or commercially reasonable guarantees and/or security from Foreign Loan Parties in each jurisdiction in which it has been agreed that guarantees and security will be granted by those Foreign Loan Parties.
⟦s002873⟧ In particular:
⟦s002874⟧ (bm) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions (including foreign exchange controls), financial assistance, anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions, corporate object, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, legal and equitable subordination, " transfer pricing ", " thin capitalisation ", " earnings stripping ", " exchange control restrictions ", " capital maintenance " rules and " liquidity impairment " rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited accordingly, provided that , to the extent requested by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of Required Lenders) before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the group consisting of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the “ Group ”) shall use commercially reasonable efforts (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;
⟦s002875⟧ (bn) a key factor in determining whether or not a guarantee or security will be taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs, guarantee fees payable to any person that is not a member of the Group and all applicable legal fees) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Lenders of obtaining such guarantee or security, as determined by the Company and the Required Lenders);
⟦s002876⟧ (bo) unless otherwise required by the Agreement, members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if they are not directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Company or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group, provided that , to the extent requested by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of Required Lenders) before signing any applicable security document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall, in relation to a contractual prohibition or restriction only, use commercially reasonable efforts (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;
⟦s002877⟧ (bp) having regard to the principle in paragraph (b) above, the Company and the Required Lenders shall discuss in good faith (having regard to customary practice in applicable jurisdictions) with a view to determining whether certain security can be provided by
⟦s002878⟧ 10 #96339085v15
⟦s002879⟧ the relevant Foreign Loan Party granting a promise to pledge in favour of the Lenders coupled with an irrevocable power of attorney to the Collateral Agent as opposed to a definitive legal mortgage or pledge over the relevant asset;
⟦s002880⟧ (bq) guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed between the Company and the Required Lenders;
⟦s002881⟧ (br) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security to the Lenders, as determined by the Company and the Required Lenders security will be granted over the material assets only;
⟦s002882⟧ (bs) it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain categories of assets, as determined by the Company and the Required Lenders, in which event security will not be taken over such assets;
⟦s002883⟧ (bt) in each case to the extent the applicable restriction, condition or third party right did not arise in contemplation of the relevant guarantee or grant of security, any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, licence, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee or security document, provided that commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consent to securing any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of Required Lenders) specifies prior to the date of the security or accession document that the asset is material and the Company is satisfied that such endeavours will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy;
⟦s002884⟧ (bu) the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Loan Documents (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to an Applicable Event which is continuing), and any requirement under these Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this paragraph (i) ;
⟦s002885⟧ (bv) any security document will only be required to be notarised if required by law in order for the relevant security to become effective (including against third parties), enforceable or admissible in evidence (including without limitation evidence before third parties);
⟦s002886⟧ (bw) to the extent possible and unless required by applicable law in order for any assignee or transferee to benefit from the guarantees or security, there should be no action required to be taken in relation to the guarantees or security when any secured party assigns or transfers any of its participation to a new secured party (and, unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in the Loan Documents, no Foreign Loan Party shall bear or
⟦s002887⟧ 11 #96339085v15
⟦s002888⟧ otherwise be liable for any taxes, any notarial, registration or perfection fees or any other costs, fees or expenses that result from any assignment or transfer by a Lender except if an Applicable Event has occurred and is continuing);
⟦s002889⟧ (bx) no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required;
