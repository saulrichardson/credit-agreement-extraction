Article II
Advances
Section 2.1.           Advances .
(a) On the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, the Borrower may, by delivery of a Funding Request to the Administrative
Agent and each Managing Agent, from time to time on any Business Day during the Revolving Period, at its option, request that the Lenders
make Advances to it (including, in the case of the Swingline Lender, any Swingline
Advances) in an amount which, at any time, shall not exceed the Availability in effect on the related Funding Date. Such Funding
Request shall be delivered not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the requested Funding Date; provided, however 
that notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no more than two Advances may be made in a calendar week. Upon receipt
of such Funding Request, the Administrative Agent (or, if applicable, each Managing Agent) shall promptly forward such Funding Request
to the Lenders (or if applicable, each Managing Agent shall promptly forward such Funding Request to the Lenders in its Lender Group),
and the applicable portion of the Advance will be made by the Lenders in accordance with their Pro-Rata Shares. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Section 2.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, no Lender shall be obligated to make any Advance
in an amount that would result in the aggregate Advances then funded by such Lender exceeding its Commitment then in effect. The obligation
of each Lender to remit its Pro-Rata Share of any such Advance allocated to
its Lender Group shall be several from that of each other Lender, and the failure of any Lender to so make such amount available
to the Borrower shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder. Each Advance to be made hereunder shall be made ratably
among the Lender Groups in accordance with their Group Advance Limits. For
the avoidance of doubt, each Lender’s obligation to refund Swingline Advances pursuant to Section 2.2(f) shall constitute
usage of its Commitment.

(b)              The
Borrower may, no later than ninety (90) days prior to the date which is two years after the Restatement Effective Date and each anniversary
thereafter, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, make written requests for the Lenders to extend the Commitment Termination
Date. The Administrative Agent will give prompt notice to each Managing Agent of its receipt of such request, and each Managing Agent
shall give prompt notice to each of the Lenders in its related Lender Group of its receipt of such request for extension of the Commitment
Termination Date. Each Lender shall make a determination, in its sole discretion and after a full credit review, not less than sixty
(60) days prior to the applicable anniversary of the Restatement Effective Date as to whether or not it will agree to extend the Commitment
Termination Date; provided, however , that the failure of any Lender to make a timely response to the Borrower’s request
for extension of the Commitment Termination Date shall be deemed to constitute a refusal by such Lender to extend the Commitment Termination
Date. In the event that at least one Lender agrees to extend the Commitment Termination Date, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
and the extending Lenders shall enter into such documents as the Administrative Agent and such extending Lenders and may deem necessary
or appropriate to reflect such extension, and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such Lenders and the Administrative Agent
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees) shall be paid by the Borrower. In the event that any Lender declines the request to extend
the Commitment Termination Date (each such Lender being referred to herein, from and after their then current Commitment Termination
Date as a “Non-Renewing Lender” ), and the Commitment of such Non-Renewing Lender is not assigned to another Person
in accordance with the terms of Article XI prior to the then current Commitment Termination Date, (i) the Facility Amount
shall be reduced by an amount equal to each such Non-Renewing Lender’s Commitment on the then current Commitment Termination Date,
and (ii) the Group Advance Limits of the applicable Lender Groups shall be reduced by an amount equal to the applicable Non-Renewing
Lender’s Commitment on the then current Commitment Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may elect to withdraw
its request to extend the Commitment Termination Date in the event that the effective Facility Amount following any Commitment Termination
Date extension would be less than the Facility Amount in effect on the Commitment Termination Date prior to such extension.
Section 2.2.           Procedures
for Advances . (a) In the case of the making of any Advance or any termination, increase
or reduction of the Facility Amount, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent a Borrower Notice. Each Borrower Notice shall specify
the amount (subject to Section 2.1 hereof) of Advances to be borrowed and the Funding Date (which shall be a Business Day).

(b)              Subject
to the conditions described in Section 2.1 , the Borrower may request an Advance from the Lenders by delivering to the Administrative
Agent at certain times the information and documents set forth in this Section 2.2 .
(c)              No
later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the proposed Funding Date (or, other than in the case of clause (i)  below,
such shorter period of time or later date as may be agreed to by the Required Lenders), the Administrative Agent, each Managing Agent,
the Document Custodian and ,
 the Collateral Custodian , and the Swingline Lender ,
as applicable, shall receive or shall have previously received the following:
(i)              a
Funding Request in the form of Exhibit A (including a duly completed Borrowing Base Certificate as of the proposed Funding
Date and giving pro forma effect to the Advance requested and the use of proceeds thereof); and
(ii)              a
wire disbursement and authorization form shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent and each Managing Agent.
(d)              Each
Funding Request shall specify the aggregate amount of the requested Advance, which shall be in an amount equal to more than $500,000.
Each Funding Request shall be accompanied by (i) a Borrower Notice, depicting the outstanding amount of Advances under this Agreement
and representing that all conditions precedent for a funding have been met, including a representation by the Borrower that the requested
Advance shall not, on the Funding Date thereof, exceed the Availability on such day, (ii) a Borrowing Base Certificate as of the
applicable Funding Date (giving pro forma effect to the Advance requested and the use of proceeds thereof), (iii) an updated Loan
List including each Loan that is subject to the requested Advance (if any), (iv) the proposed Funding Date, and (v) wire transfer
instructions for the Advance.
(e)              On
the Funding Date following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in this Section 2.2 and Article III ,
the Lenders shall deposit to the Collection Account in same day funds, in accordance with the wire transfer instructions specified in
the Funding Request, an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share of the Advance (other
than Swingline Advances) then being made. Each wire transfer of an Advance to the Borrower shall be initiated by the applicable
Lender no later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the applicable Funding Date.
(f)              Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender prior to the date on which such Lender is scheduled to make its ratable
share of the applicable aggregate amount of the requested Advance available to the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.2(e) (which
notice shall be effective upon receipt) that such Lender does not intend to make such disbursement, the Administrative Agent may assume
that such Lender has made such disbursement when due and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not
be required to) make available to the Borrower the proceeds of the amount of the requested Advance to be made by such Lender. Any amount
of the requested Advance that is not funded by the Lenders by the time required pursuant to Section 2.2(e) shall, at the Administrative
Agent’s sole discretion, have the option to be deemed to be a Swingline Advance made by the Swingline Lender in an aggregate principal
amount up to but not exceeding the Swingline Commitment that shall be refunded in accordance with Section 2.2(g) below; provided
that, the Swingline Lender shall not make a Swingline Advance if the amount of such Swingling Advance plus the Swingline Lender’s
pro rata share of Advances Outstanding as of such date plus the aggregate amount of unrefunded Swingling Advances outstanding as of such
date exceeds such Swingline Lender’s Commitment.

(g)              (i) 
Each Swingline Advance shall be refunded by the Lenders (other than the Swingline Lender, but including the Person acting as Swingline
Lender in its capacity as a Lender hereunder) no later than the Business Day following the date of such Swingline Advance (each such
date, a “Swingline Refund Date” ). Such refunding shall be made hereunder ratably among the Lender Groups in accordance
with their Group Advance Limits and by each Lender ratably in accordance with its Pro-Rata Share and shall thereafter be reflected as
Advances of the Lenders on the books and records of the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall fund its respective pro rata share of
Advances as required to repay Swingline Advances outstanding to the Swingline Lender no later than 3:00p.m. (New York City time)
on the applicable Swingline Refund Date.
(ii)              The
Borrower shall pay to the Swingline Lender, within five (5) days of demand, the amount of such Swingline Advances to the extent
amounts received from the Lenders are not sufficient to repay in full the outstanding Swingline Advances requested or required to be
refunded. If any portion of any such amount paid to the Swingline Lender shall be recovered by or on behalf of the Borrower from the
Swingline Lender in bankruptcy or otherwise, the loss of the amount so recovered shall be ratably shared among the Lender Groups in accordance
with their Group Advance Limits and by each Lender ratably in accordance with its Pro-Rata Share (other than the Swingline Lender, but
including the Person acting as Swingline Lender in its capacity as a Lender hereunder).
(iii)              Each
Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to refund Swingline Advances in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.2(g) is
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including non-satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Article III. Further, each Lender agrees and acknowledges that, if prior to the refunding of any outstanding Swingline
Advances pursuant to this Section 2.2(g), an Insolvency Event relating to a Borrower shall have occurred, each Lender will, on the
date the applicable Advance would have been made, purchase an undivided participating interest in the Swingline Advance to be refunded
in an amount equal to its ratable share of the aggregate amount of such Swingline Advance. Each Lender will immediately transfer to the
Swingline Lender, in immediately available funds, the amount of its participation and upon receipt thereof the Swingline Lender will
deliver to such Lender a certificate evidencing such participation dated the date of receipt of such funds and for such amount. Whenever,
at any time after the Swingline Lender has received from any Lender such Lender’s participating interest in a Swingline Advance,
the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account thereof, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Lender its participating interest
in such amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender’s
participating interest was outstanding and funded).

(iv)              Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Swingline Lender shall not be obligated to make any Swingline Advance at a
time when any other Lender is a Defaulting Lender, unless the Swingline Lender has entered into arrangements (which may include the delivery
of cash collateral) with the Borrower or such Defaulting Lender which are satisfactory to the Swingline Lender to eliminate the Swingline
Lender’s Fronting Exposure (without giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(ii)) with respect to any such Defaulting Lender.
Section 2.3.           Optional
Changes in Facility Amount; Prepayments . (a) The Borrower shall be entitled at its option,
on any Payment Date prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, to reduce the Facility Amount in whole or in part; provided 
that the Borrower shall give prior written notice of such reduction to the Administrative Agent and each Managing Agent as provided in
 paragraph (b)  of this Section 2.3 and that any partial reduction of the Facility Amount shall be in an amount
equal to $5,000,000 with integral multiples of $1,000,000 above such amount; provided , further that the Borrower shall
have paid to the applicable Managing Agents for the account of their related Lenders, an amount equal to the product of (x) the
Applicable Reduction Premium Percentage times (y) the amount by which the Commitment of each Lender is to be reduced under this
 clause (a)  in connection with such reduction of the Facility Amount. Unless otherwise agreed by the Lenders, the Commitment
of each Lender shall be reduced ratably in proportion to any such reduction in the Facility Amount. Any request for a reduction or termination
pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be irrevocable.
(b)              From
time to time during the Revolving Period, the Borrower may prepay any portion or all of the Advances Outstanding by delivering a Borrower
Notice to the Administrative Agent at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of such prepayment specifying the date and amount
of such prepayment. Any partial prepayment by the Borrower of Advances hereunder, other than with respect to Mandatory Prepayments, shall
be in a minimum amount of $500,000 with integral multiples of $100,000 above such amount. Any amount so prepaid may, subject to the terms
and conditions hereof, be reborrowed during the Revolving Period. A Borrower Notice relating to any such prepayment shall be irrevocable
when delivered.
(c)              Subject
to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower shall have the right, at any time from the Effective Date until the Commitment
Termination Date with the consent of the Administrative Agent, to increase the Facility Amount up to a total maximum Facility Amount
of $500,000,000. The following terms and conditions shall apply to any such increase: (i) any such increase shall be obtained from
existing Lenders or from other Eligible Assignees, in each case in accordance with the terms set forth below; (ii) the Commitment
of any Lender may not be increased without the prior written consent of such Lender; (iii) any increase in the Facility Amount shall
be in a minimum principal amount of (x) if such increase shall be obtained from existing Lenders, $5,000,000 and (y) if such
increase shall be obtained from Eligible Assignees who are not Lenders hereunder, $15,000,000; (iv) the Borrower and
Lenders , each new Lender (if any) and each existing Lender
(if any) that is increasing its commitment shall execute an acknowledgement (or ,
 in the case of the addition of a bank or other financial institution not then a party to
this Agreement new Lender , a Joinder Agreement)
in form and content satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to reflect the new
or revised Commitments Commitment(s),
as applicable, and Facility Amount (the Lenders do hereby agree to execute such acknowledgement
(or Joinder Agreement) without delay unless the acknowledgement purports to (i) increase the Commitment of a Lender without such
Lender’s consent or (ii) amend this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents other than as provided for in this Section 2.3 ) ;
(v) the Borrower shall execute such promissory notes as are necessary to reflect the increase in or creation of the Commitments;
(vi) if any Advances are outstanding at the time of any such increase, the Borrower shall make such payments and adjustments on
the Advances as necessary to give effect to the revised commitment percentages and outstandings of the Lenders; (vii) the Borrower
may solicit commitments from Eligible Assignees that are not then a party to this Agreement so long as such Eligible Assignees are reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent and execute a Joinder Agreement in form and content satisfactory to the Administrative Agent;
(viii) the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 shall be satisfied in all material respects; (ix) after giving effect
to any such increase in the Facility Amount, no Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default shall have occurred; (x) the Borrower
shall have provided to the Administrative Agent, at least thirty (30) days prior to such proposed increase in the Facility Amount (or
such shorter period as determined by the
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) ,
written evidence demonstrating pro forma compliance with the Borrowing Base Test after giving effect to such proposed increase, such
evidence to be satisfactory in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent. The amount of any increase
in the Facility Amount hereunder shall be offered first to the existing Lenders, and the failure of any existing Lender to respond 
 within five (5) Business Days of such offer shall be deemed to constitute
a refusal by such Lender to increase its Commitment with no further right of first offer. In the event the additional commitments which
existing Lenders are willing to take shall exceed the amount requested by the Borrower, such excess shall be allocated in proportion
to the commitments of such existing Lenders willing to take additional commitments. If the amount of the additional commitments requested
by the Borrower shall exceed the additional commitments which the existing Lenders are willing to take, then the Borrower may invite
other Eligible Assignees reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent to join this Agreement as Lenders hereunder for the portion
of commitments not taken by existing Lenders, provided that such Eligible Assignees shall enter into such joinder agreements to
give effect thereto as the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may
reasonably request. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the terms of any increase in
the Facility Amount shall be the same as those in effect prior to any increase; provided, however , that should the terms of the
increase agreed to be other than those in effect prior to the increase, then the Transaction Documents shall, with the consent of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, be amended to the extent necessary to incorporate any such different terms.

of a Defaulting Lender, and in such event the provisions of Section 2.16 will apply to all amounts thereafter paid by the
Borrower for the account of any such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees, indemnity
or other amounts); provided that such termination will not be deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim that the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender.
Section 2.4.           Principal
Repayments . The Advances Outstanding and all other Obligations shall be repaid in accordance
with Section 2.8 , and shall be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date. The Borrower hereby promises to pay all Advances
Outstanding and all other Obligations in full on the Maturity Date. In addition, Advances Outstanding shall be repaid as and when necessary
to cause the Borrowing Base Test to be met, and in any case within two (2) Business Days of any failure of the Borrowing Base Test
to be satisfied (each such payment, a “Mandatory Prepayment” ), and any amount so repaid may, subject to the terms

time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest thereon and paid to it, from time to time hereunder, provided 
that the failure of any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay the Advances in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Section 2.6.           Interest
Payments . (a) Interest shall accrue on each Advance outstanding during each Interest Period
at the applicable Interest Rate. The Borrower shall pay Interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance for the period commencing
on and including the Funding Date of such Advance until but excluding the date that such Advance shall be paid in full ;
 provided that any Swingline Advance repaid (other than through Advances) on the date of borrowing shall accrue one day’s
interest . Interest shall accrue during each Interest Period and be payable on the Advances Outstanding on each Payment Date,
unless earlier paid pursuant this Agreement.
(b)              Interest
Rates shall be determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the definitions thereof, and the Administrative Agent shall
advise the Borrower of each calculation thereof.
(c)              If
any Managing Agent, on behalf of the applicable Lenders, shall notify the Administrative Agent that a Disruption Event has occurred,
the Administrative Agent shall in turn so notify the Borrower, whereupon all Advances in respect of which Interest accrues at the Adjusted
Term SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin shall immediately be converted into Advances in respect of which Interest accrues at the Base
Rate plus the Applicable Margin; provided , that if at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Disruption
Event, the Base Rate shall, for a period of ten (10) consecutive days, be greater than a Lender’s actual cost of funds in
respect of its Advances hereunder, then all Advances of such Lender in respect of which Interest would accrue at the Base Rate in accordance
with this clause (c)  shall accrue Interest at an effective rate of interest equal to such Lender’s actual cost of funds
in respect of such Advances.
(d)              Anything
in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, if at any time the rate of interest payable by
any Person under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents exceeds the highest rate of interest permissible under Applicable Law (the
 “Maximum Lawful Rate” ), then, so long as the Maximum Lawful Rate would be exceeded, the rate of interest under this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents shall be equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate. If at any time thereafter the rate of interest payable
under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents is less than the Maximum Lawful Rate, such Person shall continue to pay interest under
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents at the Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total interest received from such Person
is equal to the total interest that would have been received had Applicable Law not limited the interest rate payable under this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents. In no event shall the total interest received by a Lender under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents
exceed the amount that such Lender could lawfully have received, had the interest due under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents
been calculated since the Effective Date at the Maximum Lawful Rate.

in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if any then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including Term
SOFR) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such
rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for
the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such
Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of "Interest Period"
(or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative
tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen
or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement
that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may
modify the definition of "Interest Period" (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after
such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
(v)              Benchmark
Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the
Borrower may revoke any request for an Advance of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued
during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request
for a Borrowing of or conversion to an Advance that accrues interest at the Base Rate. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period, the
component of Base Rate based upon the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate will not be used in any determination of Base Rate.

(n)              If
any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes (including any Tax credit
in lieu of refund) as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to Section 2.13(b) (including by the payment of additional
amounts pursuant to this Section 2.13), as soon as practicable after it is determined that such refund pertains to Taxes giving
rise to such refund, it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments
made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes)
of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant taxing authority with respect to such refund).
Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant
to this Section 2.13(n) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant taxing authority) in the event
that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such taxing authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
paragraph (n), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph
(n) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party
would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise
imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not
be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that
it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other person.

Outstanding of each Lender will automatically be adjusted on a prospective basis to reflect the foregoing); provided that no adjustments
will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting
Lender; provided, further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from

the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to

since the last day on which any such commercial paper shall have been outstanding.

any other provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but subject to the final two sentences of this Section 2.18(b)),
the Advances to be advanced by an Issuer hereunder shall be payable by such Issuer solely from (and no recourse shall be had against
such Issuer for the payment of any of the foregoing except from) funds obtained through the issuance of commercial paper notes in the
United States commercial paper market. Any amount which an Issuer does not pay pursuant to the operation of the preceding sentence shall
not constitute a claim as defined in Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code against such Issuer for any such insufficiency.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Issuer would (but for the operation of this Section 2.18(b)) be obligated to fund any Advance
hereunder, or make any other payment hereunder, it shall cause the Liquidity Provider under its Liquidity Facility to fund such Advances,
or make such payments, directly to the Borrower or to the other Persons entitled hereunder to receive such. The provisions of this Section 2.18(b) will

offer received, or decide to approach or not to approach any potential purchasers. The Borrower hereby waive any claims against the Administrative
Agent and the other Secured Parties arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any of the Collateral may have been sold at
a private sale was less than the price that might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Borrower’s
obligations under this Agreement, even if the Administrative Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer any portion of
the Collateral to more than one offeree; provided that the Administrative Agent has acted in a commercially reasonable manner
in conducting such private sale. Without in any way limiting the Administrative Agent’s right to conduct a foreclosure sale in
any manner which is considered commercially reasonable, the Borrower hereby agrees that any foreclosure sale conducted in accordance

Borrower agrees, to the full extent that it may lawfully so agree, that neither it nor anyone claiming through or under it will set up,

Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business at any time sell to one or more Persons (each a “Participant” )

remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder, and the Borrower, the
other Lenders, the Managing Agents and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection

this Agreement. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.13 (subject to the

 that such Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.13 , with respect to any participation,
than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment
results from a Regulatory Change that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation
shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each
Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Advances or other obligations
under the Transaction Documents (the “Participant Register” ); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation
to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to
a Participant’s interest in any Advances or other obligations under any Transaction Documents) to any Person except to the extent
that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form
under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive
absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such
participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative
Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower.
(h)              Nothing
herein shall prohibit any Lender from pledging or assigning as collateral any of its rights under this Agreement to
secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or security interest granted to any Federal Reserve Bank or other
central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender in accordance with Applicable Law and
to a Liquidity Provider pursuant to a Liquidity Facility, and any such pledge or collateral assignment may be made without
compliance with Section 11.1(b)  or Section 11.1(c) . Any
Liquidity Provider may assign, in whole or in part, its rights and obligations as Liquidity Provider to an Eligible Assignee, except
that so long as no Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time, the consent of the Borrower
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required prior to the effectiveness of any such assignment; provided ,
that (i) no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to an Affiliate of the Liquidity Provider and (ii) the
Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative
Agent and the assigning Liquidity Provider within

written notice thereof. With respect to any interests which may be assigned by an Issuer to its Liquidity Provider, the Liquidity Provider
shall have the same rights and obligations under this Agreement as would such Issuer if it were holding such interests.

the event any Lender causes increased costs, expenses or taxes to be incurred by the Administrative Agent or Managing Agents in connection
with the assignment or participation of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee then
such Lender agrees that it will make reasonable efforts to assign such increased costs, expenses or taxes to such Eligible Assignee in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
(j)              Except
to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release
of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

Eligible Assignee or Participant on the date it becomes a Lender or Participant hereunder shall certify in the applicable Assignment
and Acceptance, participation agreement or other similar document that it is an Eligible Assignee (in the case of an Assignee) or in
accordance with the terms of Section 11.1(f)  (in the case of a Participant). Any failure to include such a certification
in an Assignment and Acceptance, participation agreement or other applicable document shall render such Assignment and Acceptance, participation
agreement or other similar document void ab initio and of no force or effect for any purpose.

any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise the Borrower, its stockholders or its Affiliates on other matters) or any
other obligation to the Borrower except the obligations expressly set forth in the Transaction Documents and (y) each Lender is
acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of the Borrower, or its management, stockholders, creditors or any other

or similar duty to such Person, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

other amounts owing them; provided that:

any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall
be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees,
to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements
may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

Guarantees . To induce the Lenders to provide the credits described herein and in consideration
of benefits expected to accrue to the Borrower by reason of the Commitments and for other good and valuable consideration, receipt of
which is hereby acknowledged, each Guarantor party hereto (including any Guarantor executing an Additional Guarantor Supplement in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit I or such other form acceptable to the Administrative Agent) hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees jointly and severally to the Secured Parties, the due and punctual payment of all present and future Obligations, including,
but not limited to, the due and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Advances Outstanding, and the due and punctual payment
of all other Obligations now or hereafter owed by the Borrower under the Transaction Documents as and when the same shall become due
and payable, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise, according to the terms hereof and thereof (including all interest,
costs, fees, and charges after the entry of an order for relief against the Borrower or such other obligor in a case under the Bankruptcy
Code or any similar proceeding, whether or not such interest, costs, fees and charges would be an allowed claim against the Borrower
or any such obligor in any such proceeding). In case of failure by the Borrower or other obligor punctually to pay any Obligations guaranteed
hereby, each Guarantor hereby unconditionally agrees to make such payment or to cause such payment to be made punctually as and when
the same shall become due and payable, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by
the Borrower or such obligor.
Section 15.2.       Guarantee
Unconditional . The obligations of each Guarantor under this Article XV shall be unconditional
and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged, or otherwise affected by:
(a)              any
extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver, or release in respect of any obligation of any Loan Party or other obligor or of
any other guarantor under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or by operation of law or otherwise;
(b)              any
modification or amendment of or supplement to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document;

(c)              any
change in the corporate existence, structure, or ownership of, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, or other similar proceeding
affecting, any Loan Party or other obligor, any other guarantor, or any of their respective assets, or any resulting release or discharge
of any obligation of any Loan Party or other obligor or of any other guarantor contained in any Transaction Document;
(d)              the
existence of any claim, set-off, or other rights which any Loan Party or other obligor or any other guarantor may have at any time against
the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether or not arising in connection herewith;
(e)              any
failure to assert, or any assertion of, any claim or demand or any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights or remedies against
any Loan Party or other obligor, any other guarantor, or any other Person or Property;
(f)              any
application of any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any obligation of any Loan Party or other obligor, regardless of
what obligations of any Loan Party or other obligor remain unpaid;
(g)              any
invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any Loan Party or other obligor or any other guarantor for any reason of this Agreement
or of any other Transaction Document or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by any Loan
Party or other obligor or any other guarantor of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount payable under the Transaction
Documents; or
(h)              any
other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person or any other circumstance
whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this subsection, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the obligations of any
Guarantor under this Article XV.
Section 15.3.       Discharge
Only upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement in Certain Circumstances . Each Guarantor’s obligations
under this Article XV shall remain in full force and effect until the Commitments are terminated and the principal of and interest
on the Advances Outstanding and all other amounts payable by the Borrower and the other Loan Parties under this Agreement and all other
Transaction Documents shall have been paid in full. If at any time any payment of the principal of or interest on any Advance Outstanding
or any other amount payable by any Loan Party or other obligor or any guarantor under the Transaction Documents is rescinded or must
be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of such Loan Party or other obligor or of any guarantor,
or otherwise, each Guarantor’s obligations under this Article XV with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such
time as though such payment had become due but had not been made at such time.

Section 15.4.       Subrogation .
Each Guarantor agrees it will not exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation by any payment made hereunder, or otherwise,
until all the Obligations shall have been paid in full subsequent to the termination of all the Commitments. If any amount shall be paid
to a Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time prior to the later of (x) the payment in full of the Obligations
and all other amounts payable by the Loan Parties hereunder and the other Transaction Documents and (y) the termination of the Commitments,
such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders (and their Affiliates) and shall forthwith
be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders (and their Affiliates) or be credited and applied upon the Obligations,
whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Section 15.5.       Subordination .
Each Guarantor (each referred to herein as a “Subordinated Creditor” ) hereby subordinates the payment of all indebtedness,
obligations, and liabilities of the Borrower or other Loan Party owing to such Subordinated Creditor, whether now existing or hereafter
arising, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Obligations. During the existence of any Event of Default, subject to Section 15.4,
any such indebtedness, obligation, or liability of the Borrower or other Loan Party owing to such Subordinated Creditor shall be enforced
and performance received by such Subordinated Creditor as trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Obligations and the proceeds
thereof shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent for application to the Obligations (whether or not then due), but without reducing
or affecting in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under this Article XV.
Section 15.6.       Waivers .
Each Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest, and any notice not provided for herein, as well as
any requirement that at any time any action be taken by the Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any other Person against the Borrower
or any other Loan Party or other obligor, another guarantor, or any other Person.
Section 15.7.       Limit
on Recovery . Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the right of recovery against each
Guarantor under this Article XV shall not exceed $1.00 less than the lowest amount which would render such Guarantor’s obligations
under this Article XV void or voidable under applicable law, including, without limitation, fraudulent conveyance law.
Section 15.8.       Stay
of Acceleration . If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower
or other Loan Party or other obligor under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy
or reorganization of the Borrower or such other Loan Party or obligor, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms
of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by
the Administrative Agent made at the request or otherwise with the consent of the Required Lenders.
Section 15.9.       Benefit
to Guarantors . The Loan Parties are engaged in related businesses and integrated to such an
extent that the financial strength and flexibility of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties has a direct impact on the success of each
other Loan Party. Each Guarantor will derive substantial direct and indirect benefit from the extensions of credit hereunder, and each
Guarantor acknowledges that this guarantee is necessary or convenient to the conduct, promotion and attainment of its business. Each
Guarantor represents that it (i) has all necessary power and authority and legal right to (A) execute and deliver this Agreement,
(B) carry out the terms of the Agreement applicable to it and (C) grant Liens in the Collateral and (ii) has duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement to which it is a party and the Lien in the
Collateral on the terms and conditions herein provided.

Section 15.10.       Amendment
and Restatement . This Agreement shall become effective on the Restatement Effective Date and
shall supersede all provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement as of such date and the Existing Credit Agreement shall thereafter be
of no further force and effect, except to evidence (i) the incurrence by the Borrower of the obligations under the Existing Credit
Agreement (whether or not such obligations are contingent as of the Restatement Effective Date), (ii) the representations and warranties
made by the Borrower prior to the Restatement Effective Date and (iii) any action or omission performed or required to be performed
pursuant to such Existing Credit Agreement prior to the Restatement Effective Date. From and after the Restatement Effective Date all
references made to the Existing Credit Agreement in any Transaction Document or in any other instrument or document shall, without further
action, be deemed to refer to this Agreement. This Agreement amends and restates the Existing Credit Agreement and is not intended to
be or operate as a novation or an accord and satisfaction of the Existing Credit Agreement or the obligations and liabilities of the
Borrower evidenced or provided for thereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower agrees that notwithstanding
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the security interest, lien, collateral security or supporting obligations previously granted
to the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity pursuant to the Transaction Documents shall be and remain in full force and effect
and that any rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity thereunder and obligations of the Borrower thereunder
shall be and remain in full force and effect, shall not be affected, impaired or discharged thereby and shall secure all of the Borrower’s
Obligations and liabilities to Administrative Agent and the Lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement as amended and restated hereby.
Without limiting the foregoing, the parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledge and agree that the “Credit Agreement” referred
to in the Transaction Documents shall from and after the date hereof be deemed references to this Agreement.
