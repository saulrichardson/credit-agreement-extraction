⟦s001465⟧ Interest Rates; LIBOR Benchmark Notification .
⟦s001466⟧ The interest rate on a Loan denominated in U.S. Dollars or a Foreign Currency may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that may be discontinued or is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform.
⟦s001467⟧ Regulators have signaled the need to use alternative benchmark reference rates for some of these interest rate benchmarks and, as a result, such interest rate benchmarks may cease to comply with applicable laws and regulations, may be permanently discontinued, and/or the basis on which they are calculated may change.
⟦s001468⟧ The London interbank offered rate (“ LIBOR ”) is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market.
⟦s001469⟧ On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“ FCA ”) publicly announced that (a) immediately after December 31, 2021, publication of all seven euro LIBOR settings, the overnight, 1-week, 2-month and 12-month British Pound Sterling LIBOR settings, and the 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will permanently cease; (b) immediately after June 30, 2023, publication of the overnight and 12-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will permanently cease; immediately after December 31, 2021, the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month British Pound Sterling LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or, subject to consultation by the FCA, be provided on a changed methodology (or “synthetic”) basis and no longer be representative of the underlying market and economic reality they are intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored; and (c) immediately after June 30, 2023, the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or, subject to the FCA’s consideration of the case, be provided on a synthetic basis and no longer be representative of the underlying market and economic reality they are intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored.
⟦s001470⟧ There is no assurance that dates announced by the FCA will not change or that the administrator of LIBOR and/or regulators will not take further action that could impact the availability, composition, or characteristics of LIBOR or the currencies and/or tenors for which LIBOR is published.
⟦s001471⟧ Each party to this agreement should consult its own advisors to stay informed of any such developments.
⟦s001472⟧ Public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of LIBOR.

⟦s001475⟧ However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter related to the Daily Simple RFR, LIBOR, the CDOR Rate or other rates in the definition of “ LIBO Rate” (or “EURIBOR Rate”, as applicable) any interest rate used in this agreement or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any such alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to Section 2.14(b) or (c), whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term
⟦s001476⟧ 68
⟦s001477⟧ SOFR Transition Event, an Early Opt-in Election or an Other Benchmark Rate Election, and (ii) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 2.14(d)) , including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the Daily Simple RFR , the LIBO Rate (or the EURIBOR Rate or CDOR Rate, as applicable) existing interest rate being replaced or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate (or the euro interbank offered rate, as applicable) any existing interest rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability.
⟦s001478⟧ The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any Daily Simple RFR, interest rate used in this Agreement or any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower.
⟦s001479⟧ The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any RFR, Daily Simple RFR, the Eurocurrency Rate, the CDOR Rate or interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to any Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.

⟦s001904⟧ Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes (i) the Administrative Agent to make a Borrowing for the purpose of paying each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents and agrees that all such amounts charged shall constitute Loans (including Swingline Loans, but such a Borrowing may only constitute a Protective Advance if it is to reimburse costs, fees and expenses as described in Section 9.03) and that all such Borrowings shall be deemed to have been requested pursuant to Section 2.03, 2.04 or 2.05, as applicable, and (ii) the
⟦s001905⟧ 101
⟦s001906⟧ Administrative Agent to charge any deposit account of the relevant Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents.

⟦s001908⟧ Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
⟦s001909⟧ Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such applicable payment from a Foreign Loan Party shall only be used to purchase a participation in a Foreign Secured Obligation in the same order set forth above.

⟦s001911⟧ In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (including without limitation the Overnight Rate in the case of Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency).
⟦s001912⟧ (f) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it hereunder, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations hereunder until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender hereunder; application of amounts pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be made in any order determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.

⟦s001916⟧ 102
⟦s001917⟧ Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.
⟦s001918⟧ The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
⟦s001919⟧ (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations under this Agreement and other Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrowers shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and in circumstances where its consent would be required under Section 9.04, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments.
⟦s001920⟧ A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

⟦s003050⟧ The Administrative Agent agrees to restrict the enforcement of the guarantee or any indemnity granted by each German Loan Party pursuant to this Agreement and any joint and several liability assumed hereunder (together, the “ Security ”) if and to the extent that (i) such Security secures any liabilities of such German Loan Party’s direct or indirect shareholder(s) (upstream) or any entity affiliated to such shareholder ( verbundenes Unternehmen ) within the meaning of Section 15 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( Aktiengesetz ) (cross-stream) (other than the liabilities of any of such German Loan Party’s Subsidiaries and, for the avoidance of doubt, such German Loan Party’s own liabilities) and (ii) the enforcement of such Security would cause the amount of such German Loan Party’s net assets ( Reinvermögen ), as adjusted pursuant to the following provisions, to fall below the amount of its registered share capital ( Stammkapital ) ( Begründung einer Unterbilanz ) or to increase any already existing capital impairment ( Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz ) in violation of Sections 30 and 31 of the German Limited Liability Company Act ( GmbHG ), (each such event is hereinafter referred to as a “ Capital Impairment ”) or would deprive such German Loan Party of the liquidity necessary to fulfill its liabilities towards its creditors (a “ Liquidity Impairment ”).
⟦s003051⟧ For the purposes of the calculation of a Capital Impairment for any German Loan Party, the following balance sheet items shall be adjusted as follows: (a) the amount of any increase of such German Loan Party’s registered share capital after the date of this Agreement that has been effected without prior written consent of the Administrative Agent shall be deducted from such German Loan Party’s registered share capital; (b) loans provided to such German Loan Party shall be disregarded if and to the extent such loans are subordinated or are considered subordinated by operation of law and such loans are not shown in the balance sheet as liability of the German Loan Party; (c) loans or other contractual liabilities incurred in violation of the provisions of the Loan Documents shall be disregarded; (d) non-distributable assets (§ 268 (8) of the German Commercial Code) shall be disregarded (i.e. deducted); and (e) the net assets shall take into account the costs of the Auditor’s Determination (as defined below) either as a reduction of assets or an increase of liabilities.
⟦s003052⟧ (b) Disposal of Relevant Assets .
⟦s003053⟧ In a situation where any German Loan Party would not have sufficient assets to maintain its registered share capital after satisfaction (in whole or in part) of the relevant demand, such German Loan Party shall dispose of all assets, to the extent legally permitted and to the extent necessary to satisfy the amounts demanded under the Security granted by such German Loan Party which are not necessary for its business ( nicht betriebsnotwendig ) on market terms where the relevant assets are shown in the balance sheet of such German Loan Party with a book value which is significantly lower than the market value of such assets, unless such disposal would not be
⟦s003054⟧ 177
⟦s003055⟧ commercially justifiable, provided that the Administrative Agent consents to the fact that a disposal would not be commercially justifiable.
⟦s003056⟧ (c) Management Notification/Auditor’s Determination .
⟦s003057⟧ (i) The limitation pursuant to this Section 11.14 shall apply, subject to the following requirements, if, following a notice by the Administrative Agent that it intends to enforce any Security or a demand by the Administrative Agent under any such Security, the applicable German Loan Party notifies the Administrative Agent (“ Management Notification ”) within fifteen (15) days upon receipt of the relevant notice or demand that a Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would occur (setting out in reasonable detail to what extent a Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would occur and providing prima facie evidence that a realisation or other measures undertaken in accordance with the mitigation provisions set out above would not prevent such Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment); provided that until and including the earlier of (x) the date falling fifteen (15) Business Days after the notice or demand of the Administrative Agent regarding the enforcement of any Security and (y) the date of delivery of the Management Notification to the Administrative Agent, the right to enforce such Security (whether in full or in part) shall be suspended.
⟦s003058⟧ (ii) If the Management Notification is contested by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall nevertheless be entitled to enforce any Security granted under this Agreement up to such amount, which is, based on the Management Notification, undisputed between itself and the applicable German Loan Party.
⟦s003059⟧ In relation to the amount which is in dispute, the applicable German Loan Party undertakes (at its own cost and expense) to arrange for the preparation of a balance sheet by its auditors in order to have such auditors determine whether (and if so, to what extent) any payment under the Security would cause a Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment (the “ Auditor’s Determination ”).
⟦s003060⟧ The Auditor’s Determination shall be prepared, taking into account the adjustments set out above in relation to the calculation of a Capital Impairment, by applying the generally accepted accounting principles applicable from time to time in Germany ( Grundsätze ordnungsmäßiger Buchführung ) based on the same principles and evaluation methods as consistently applied by the applicable German Loan Party in the preparation of its financial statements, in particular in the preparation of its most recent annual balance sheet, and taking into consideration applicable court rulings of German courts.
⟦s003061⟧ The applicable German Loan Party shall provide the Auditor’s Determination to the Administrative Agent within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as has been agreed between the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent) from the date on which the Administrative Agent contested the Management Notification in writing.
⟦s003062⟧ The Auditor’s Determination shall be binding on the applicable German Loan Party and the Administrative Agent.
⟦s003063⟧ (iii) If, and to the extent that, any Security has been enforced without regard to the limitation set forth in this Section 11.14 because the amount of the available net assets or liquidity pursuant to the Auditor’s Determination is lower than the amount stated in the Management Notification, the Administrative Agent shall upon written demand of the applicable German Loan Party to the Administrative Agent repay any amount (if and to the extent already paid to the Administrative Agent) up to and including the amount calculated in the Auditor’s Determination in accordance with this Section 11.14, provided such demand for repayment is made to the Administrative Agent within six (6) months ( Ausschlussfrist ) from the date such Security has been enforced.
⟦s003064⟧ (iv) If pursuant to the Auditor’s Determination the amount of the available net assets or liquidity is higher than set out in the Management Notification, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to enforce into such available net assets accordingly.
⟦s003065⟧ (d) Exceptions .
⟦s003066⟧ Notwithstanding the above, the limitations pursuant to this Section 11.14 shall not apply to any German Loan Party:
⟦s003067⟧ (i) if such German Loan Party is party as dominated entity ( beherrschtes Unternehmen ) of a domination agreement ( Beherrschungsvertrag ) and/or a profit and loss transfer agreement ( Gewinnabführungsvertrag ) pursuant to Section 30, paragraph 1, sentence 2 of the German Limited Liability Company Act ( GmbHG ) and payment by or enforcement against the German Loan Party would not violate Section 30, paragraph 1 GmbHG; provided , that the limitations pursuant to this Section 11.14
⟦s003068⟧ 178
⟦s003069⟧ shall apply if the dominating entity is insolvent or payment by the dominated entity would result in the insolvency of the dominated entity;
⟦s003070⟧ (ii) if such German Loan Party has a recourse right ( Rückgewähranspruch ) pursuant to Section 30, paragraph 1, sentence 2 of the German Limited Liability Company Act ( GmbHG ) which is fully recoverable ( werthaltig );
⟦s003071⟧ (iii) if such German Loan Party fails to deliver the Management Notification and/or the Auditor’s Determination pursuant to this Section 11.14 in the required timeframe, unless such German Loan Party proves in a court proceeding that the disputed amount is necessary for maintaining its registered share capital;
⟦s003072⟧ (iv) to any amounts borrowed under the Loan Documents to the extent the proceeds of such borrowing are on-lent to such German Loan Party or its Subsidiaries to the extent that any amounts so on-lent are still outstanding at the time the relevant demand is made against such German Loan Party and the repayment of such loans as a result of such on-lending is not prohibited by law; or
⟦s003073⟧ (v) to any amounts borrowed under the Loan Documents by such German Loan Party to the extent that any amounts so borrowed are still outstanding at the time the relevant demand for repayment is made against such German Loan Party.

KG, the managing directors of the general partner of such German Loan Party) are required by law to demand repayment of Intercompany Indebtedness in order to avoid personal and/or criminal liability due to a violation of capital maintenance, liquidity protection or similar or comparable rules under applicable German law and/or if and to the extent required to avoid non-compliance with section 30 of the German Limited Liability Companies Act ( GmbHG ), the German Loan Party may demand to receive and may receive payments with respect to Intercompany Indebtedness regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred.

⟦s003110⟧ No Loan Party shall have any right to possession of any such asset or to foreclose upon any such asset, whether by judicial action or otherwise, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been fully paid and satisfied (in cash) and all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document, any Swap Agreement or any Banking Services Agreement have been terminated.
⟦s003111⟧ If all or any part of the assets of any Obligor, or the proceeds thereof, are subject to any distribution, division or application to the creditors of such Obligor, whether partial or complete, voluntary or involuntary, and whether by reason of liquidation, bankruptcy, administration, arrangement, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other action or proceeding, or if
⟦s003112⟧ 180
⟦s003113⟧ the business of any such Obligor is dissolved or if substantially all of the assets of any such Obligor are sold pursuant to any such proceeding, then, and in any such event (such events being herein referred to as an “ Insolvency Event ”), any payment or distribution of any kind or character, either in cash, securities or other property, which shall be payable or deliverable upon or with respect to any indebtedness of any Obligor to any Loan Party (“ Intercompany Indebtedness ”) shall be paid or delivered directly to the Administrative Agent for application on any of the Guaranteed Obligations, due or to become due, until such Guaranteed Obligations shall have first been fully paid and satisfied (in cash); provided , however , that no such payment of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be required to be made in violation of Section 9.21.
