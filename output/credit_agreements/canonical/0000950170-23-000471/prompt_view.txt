⟦s000647⟧ Thereafter, the interest rate payable shall be the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate again would exceed the Maximum Lawful Rate, in which event this provision shall again apply.
⟦s000648⟧ In no event shall the total interest received by any Lender exceed the amount which it could lawfully have received had the interest been calculated for the full term hereof at the Maximum Lawful Rate.
⟦s000649⟧ If, notwithstanding the prior sentence, any Lender has received interest hereunder in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate, such excess amount shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Loans or to other amounts (other than interest) payable hereunder, and if no such principal or other amounts are then outstanding, such excess or part thereof remaining shall be paid to Borrower.
⟦s000650⟧ In computing interest payable with reference to the Maximum Lawful Rate applicable to any Lender, such interest shall be calculated at a daily rate equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate divided by the number of days in the year in which such calculation is made.

⟦s000652⟧ (a) All payments of principal and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any present or future Taxes, except as required by applicable law.
⟦s000653⟧ If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable
⟦s000654⟧ 48
⟦s000655⟧ Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and if any such withholding or deduction is in respect of any Indemnified Taxes, then Borrower shall pay such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Agent and each Lender will equal the full amount Agent and such Lender would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required (including, without limitation, such withholdings and deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.8).
⟦s000656⟧ After payment of any Tax by Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.8, such Borrower shall promptly forward to Agent the original or a certified copy of an official receipt or other documentation evidencing such payment to such authority.
⟦s000657⟧ Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
⟦s000658⟧ (b) Borrower shall indemnify Agent and Lenders, within ten (10) days after demand thereof, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.8) payable or paid by Agent or any Lender or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to Agent or any Lender and any reasonable and documented expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
⟦s000659⟧ A certificate in reasonable detail as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to Agent), or by Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
⟦s000660⟧ (c) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments made under any Financing Document shall deliver to Borrower and Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.
⟦s000661⟧ In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent as will enable Borrower or Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
⟦s000662⟧ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.8(c)(i), 2.8(c)(ii) and 2.8(e) below) shall not be required if in such Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
⟦s000663⟧ (i) Each Lender that is not a “United States person” (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is a party hereto on the Closing Date or purports to become an assignee of an interest pursuant to Section 11.17(a) after the Closing Date (unless such Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment) (each such Lender a “ Foreign Lender ”) shall, to the extent permitted by Law, execute and deliver to Borrower and Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or Agent) whichever of the following is applicable: (A) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Financing Document, two (2) properly completed and executed originals of United States Internal Revenue Service (“ IRS ”) Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to the “interest” article of

⟦s000665⟧ such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Financing Documents, two (2) properly completed and executed originals of IRS Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (B) two (2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form); (C) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “ U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate ”) and (y) two (2) executed originals of IRS Forms W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form); (D) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, two (2) executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or successor form), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit F-3 , IRS Form W-9 (or successor form), and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; or (E) other applicable forms, certificates or documents prescribed by the IRS.
⟦s000666⟧ Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrower and Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
⟦s000667⟧ In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, such forms shall be delivered by each Foreign Lender upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Lender.
⟦s000668⟧ Each Foreign Lender shall promptly notify Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose).
⟦s000669⟧ (ii) Each Lender that is a “United States person” (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is a party hereto on the Closing Date or purports to become an assignee of an interest pursuant to Section 11.17(a) after the Closing Date (unless such Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment) shall, to the extent permitted by Law, provide to Borrower and Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or Agent), a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9 or any successor form certifying as to such Lender’s entitlement to an exemption from U.S. backup withholding and other applicable forms, certificates or documents prescribed by the IRS or reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent.
⟦s000670⟧ Each such Lender shall promptly notify Borrower at any time it determines that any certificate previously delivered to Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. governmental authorities for such purposes) is no longer valid.
⟦s000671⟧ (iii) Any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower and Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit Borrower or Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
⟦s000672⟧ 50
⟦s000673⟧ (d) If any Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund in respect of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.8 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.8), then it shall promptly pay an amount equal to such refund to Borrower, net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or of Agent with respect thereto, including any Taxes; provided , however , that Borrower, upon the written request of such Lender or Agent, agree to repay any amount paid over to Borrower to such Lender or to Agent (plus any related penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such Lender or Agent is required, for any reason, to disgorge or otherwise repay such refund.
⟦s000674⟧ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.8, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.8(d) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.
⟦s000675⟧ This Section 2.8 shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
⟦s000676⟧ (e) If a payment made to a Lender under any Financing Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower and Agent at the time or times prescribed by Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Agent as may be necessary for Borrower and Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
⟦s000677⟧ Solely for purposes of this clause (e), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
⟦s000678⟧ (f) Each Lender shall severally indemnify Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.17 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by Agent in connection with any Financing Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
⟦s000679⟧ A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
⟦s000680⟧ Each Lender hereby authorizes Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Financing Document or otherwise payable by Agent to such Lender from any other source against any amount due to Agent under this paragraph (f).
⟦s000681⟧ (g) If any Lender shall reasonably determine that the adoption or taking effect of, or any change in, any applicable Law regarding capital adequacy, in each instance, after the Closing Date, or any change after the Closing Date in the interpretation, administration or application thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation, administration or application thereof, or the compliance by any Lender or any Person controlling such Lender with any request, guideline or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of Law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency adopted or otherwise taking effect after the Closing Date, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such controlling Person’s capital as a consequence of such Lender’s obligations hereunder to a level below that
⟦s000682⟧ 51
⟦s000683⟧ which such Lender or such controlling Person could have achieved but for such adoption, taking effect, change, interpretation, administration, application or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such controlling Person’s policies with respect to capital adequacy) then from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (which demand shall be accompanied by a certificate setting forth the basis for such demand and a calculation of the amount thereof in reasonable detail, a copy of which shall be furnished to Agent), Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender such additional amount as will compensate such Lender or such controlling Person for such reduction, so long as such amounts have accrued on or after the day which is two hundred seventy (270) days prior to the date on which such Lender first made demand therefor; provided that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a “change in applicable Law”, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.
⟦s000684⟧ (h) If any Lender shall reasonably determine that the adoption or taking effect of, or any change in, any applicable Law shall (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender, (ii) subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, or any SOFR Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Other Connection Taxes that are imposed on or measured by net income (however denominated) or that are franchise Taxes or branch profits Taxes; or (iii) impose on any Lender any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or SOFR Loans made by such Lender, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to Term SOFR (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
⟦s000685⟧ (i) If any Lender requests compensation under any of the clauses in this Section 2.8, or requires Borrower to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.8, then, upon the written request of Borrower, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder (subject to the provisions of Section 11.17) to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or materially reduce amounts payable pursuant to any such Section, as the case may be, in the future, (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and (iii) would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender (as determined in its sole good faith discretion).
⟦s000686⟧ Without limitation of the provisions of Section 13.14, Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
⟦s000687⟧ (j) Subject to Section 2.2(j), if Agent (acting at the written direction of the Required Lenders) determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Term SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period, Agent will promptly so notify Borrower and each Lender.
⟦s000688⟧ Upon notice thereof by Agent to Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans shall be suspended until Agent (acting at the written direction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice and be replaced by the obligation of the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans.
⟦s000689⟧ Upon receipt of such notice, any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will
⟦s000690⟧ 52
⟦s000691⟧ be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period.
⟦s000692⟧ Upon any such conversion, Borrower shall also pay any additional amounts required pursuant to this Agreement.
⟦s000693⟧ (k) If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund SOFR Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon Term SOFR, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to Borrower (through Agent), any obligation of such Lender to make SOFR Loans shall be suspended and replaced with the obligation to make Base Rate Loans, in each case until such Lender notifies Agent and Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.
⟦s000694⟧ Upon receipt of such notice, all SOFR Loans shall become Base Rate Loans.
⟦s000695⟧ Upon any such conversion, Borrower shall also pay any additional amounts required pursuant to this Agreement.
⟦s000696⟧ (l) Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.8 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations hereunder.

⟦s000703⟧ Upon at least ten (10) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Agent (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Required Lenders) and pursuant to customary payoff documentation, Borrower may, at its option, terminate this Agreement; provided , however , that no such termination shall be effective until Borrower has complied with Section 2.11(c).
⟦s000704⟧ Any notice of termination given by Borrower shall be irrevocable unless all Lenders otherwise agree in writing and no Lender shall have any obligation to make any Loans on or after the termination date stated in such notice; provided that a notice of termination may state that such notice is conditioned upon the consummation of an acquisition or sale transaction or upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of other Debt or any other specified event, in which case such notice may be revoked by Borrower by notice to the Agent on or prior to the specified effective date if such condition is not satisfied.

⟦s000709⟧ All undertakings, agreements, covenants, warranties and representations of the Credit Parties contained in the Financing Documents shall survive any such termination and Agent shall retain its Liens in the Collateral and Agent and each Lender shall retain all of its rights and remedies under the Financing Documents notwithstanding such termination until all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has been made) have been discharged or paid, in full, in immediately available funds, including, without limitation, Obligations under Section 2.2 and the terms of the Agency Fee Letter resulting from such termination.
⟦s000710⟧ Upon the payment in full, in cash in immediately available funds, of all Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has been made) and the termination of the Term Loan Commitments, Agent shall, at Borrower’s sole cost and expense, execute and deliver such documents

⟦s001147⟧ (e) Nothing contained herein or in any other Financing Document shall be construed as requiring Agent or any Lender to resort to any part of the Collateral for the satisfaction of any of Credit Parties’ obligations under the Financing Documents in preference or priority to any other Collateral, and to the extent an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Agent may seek satisfaction out of all of the Collateral or any part thereof, in its absolute discretion in respect of Credit Parties’ obligations under the Financing Documents.
⟦s001148⟧ In addition, at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent shall have the right from time to time to partially foreclose upon any Collateral in any manner and for any amounts secured by the Financing Documents then due and payable as determined by Agent in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, the following circumstances: (i) in the event any Credit Party defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more scheduled payments of principal and/or interest, Agent may foreclose upon all or any part of the Collateral to recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) in the event Agent elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding principal balance of the Loans, Agent may foreclose all or any part of the Collateral to recover so much of the principal balance of the Loans as Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by one or more of the Financing Documents as Agent may elect.

⟦s001151⟧ 87
⟦s001152⟧ or Lenders to exhaust their remedies against any part of the Collateral before proceeding against any other part of the Collateral; and further in the event of such foreclosure each Credit Party does hereby expressly consent to and authorize, at the option of Agent, the foreclosure and sale either separately or together of each part of the Collateral.

⟦s001155⟧ However, no specification in this Agreement of a specific legal or equitable remedy shall be construed as a waiver or prohibition against any other legal or equitable remedies in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Agreement.

⟦s001226⟧ Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by Required Lenders (or all or such other portion of the Lenders as shall be prescribed by this Agreement) in accordance with the terms hereof.

⟦s001324⟧ Each Payment Recipient agrees that it shall not assert any right or claim to any Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payments, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine.

⟦s001328⟧ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, and for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the occurrence of an Erroneous Payment (or any Erroneous Payment Subrogation Rights or other rights of the Agent in respect of an Erroneous Payment) result in the Agent becoming, or being deemed to be, a Lender hereunder or the holder of any Loans hereunder.

⟦s001333⟧ (g) The provisions of this Section 11.20 to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) nothing in this Section 11.20 will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from any Payment Recipient’s receipt of an Erroneous Payment and (ii) there will only be deemed to be a recovery of the Erroneous Payment to the extent that Agent has received payment from the Payment Recipient in immediately available funds the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency, whether directly from the Payment Recipient, as a result of the exercise by Agent of its rights of subrogation or set off as set forth above in clause (e) or as a result of the receipt by Agent Assignee of a payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Loans assigned to Agent Assignee pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, but excluding any other amounts in respect thereof (it being agreed that any payments of interest, fees, expenses or other amounts (other than principal) received by Agent Assignee in respect of the Loans assigned to Agent Assignee pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment shall be the sole property of the Agent Assignee and shall not constitute a recovery of the Erroneous Payment).

⟦s001377⟧ All such payments and credits may be applied, reversed and reapplied, in whole or in part, to any of the Obligations that Agent shall determine,
⟦s001378⟧ 103

⟦s001383⟧ In the event of the foreclosure of the Financing Documents and of a deficiency, each Guarantor hereby promises and agrees forthwith to pay the amount of such deficiency notwithstanding the fact that recovery of said deficiency against Borrower or any other Credit Party would not be allowed by applicable law; however, the foregoing shall not be deemed to require that Agent or Lenders institute foreclosure proceedings or otherwise resort to or exhaust any other collateral or security prior to or concurrently with enforcing this guaranty.

⟦s001386⟧ Each Guarantor agrees that, while an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or to the extent otherwise prohibited under the Financing Documents, until the Obligations have been paid in full, such Guarantor will not seek, accept, or retain for its own account, any payment from Borrower on account of such subordinated debt.
⟦s001387⟧ Any payments to any Guarantor on account of such subordinated debt shall be collected and received by such Guarantor in trust for Agent and Lenders and shall be immediately paid over to Agent, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, on account of the Obligations without impairing or releasing the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.

⟦s001389⟧ If such Guarantor does not file any such claim, Agent, as attorney‑in‑fact for such Guarantor, is hereby irrevocably authorized to do so in the name of such Guarantor, or in Agent’s
⟦s001390⟧ 104
⟦s001391⟧ discretion, to assign the claim to a designee and cause proof of claim to be filed in the name of Agent’s designee.
⟦s001392⟧ In all such cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the person or persons authorized to pay such claim shall pay to Agent, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, the full amount thereof and, to the full extent necessary for that purpose, each Guarantor hereby assigns to the Lenders all of such Guarantor’s rights to any such payments or distributions to which such Guarantor would otherwise be entitled, such assignment being a present and irrevocable assignment of all such rights.

⟦s001395⟧ This Section 12.7 with respect to the Maximum Liability of each Guarantor is intended solely to preserve the rights of the Agent and the Lenders to the maximum extent not subject to avoidance under applicable law, and no Guarantor nor any other Person shall have any right or claim under this Section 12.7 with respect to such Maximum Liability, except to the extent necessary so that the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder shall not be rendered voidable under applicable law.
⟦s001396⟧ Each Guarantor agrees that the Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum Liability of each Guarantor without impairing this guaranty or affecting the rights and remedies of the Agent or the Lenders hereunder, provided that, nothing in this sentence shall be construed to increase any Guarantor’s obligations hereunder beyond its Maximum Liability.

⟦s001410⟧ In furtherance of that intention, the liabilities of each Guarantor under this Guaranty (the “ Liabilities ”) shall be limited to the maximum amount that will, after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Person with respect to the Liabilities, including pursuant to Section 12.12, result in the Liabilities of such Guarantor under this Guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

⟦s001416⟧ (b) Guarantors hereby agree, as between themselves, that to the extent that Agent, on behalf of Lenders, shall have received from any Guarantor any Recovery Amount (as defined below), then the paying Guarantor shall have a right of contribution against each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s contributive share of such Recovery Amount; provided, however, that in the event any Guarantor suffers a Deficiency Amount (as defined below), then the Guarantor suffering the Deficiency Amount shall be entitled to seek and receive contribution from and against the other Guarantors in an amount equal to the Deficiency Amount; and provided, further, that in no event shall the aggregate amounts so reimbursed by reason of the contribution of any Guarantor equal or exceed an amount that would, if paid, constitute or result in Fraudulent Conveyance.
