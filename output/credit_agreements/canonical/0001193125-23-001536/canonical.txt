Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Section 5.01(e) or otherwise. Initially, the Applicable Rate as of the Effective Date shall be
based on the Pricing Level III above. Thereafter, each change in the Applicable Rate shall apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such
change. If the rating system of Moody’s, S&P or Fitch shall change, or if any of such rating agencies shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Company and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend

determine whether such Acquisition, disposition or issuance, incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness or other transaction is not prohibited to be consummated hereunder) immediately after giving effect to such Acquisition, disposition or issuance,
incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness (and to any other such transaction consummated since the first day of the period for which such pro forma computation is being made and on or prior to the date of such computation) as if such transaction had
occurred on the first day of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending with the most recent fiscal quarter for which financial statements shall have been delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or 5.01(b) (or, prior to the delivery of
any such financial statements, ending with the fiscal quarter ended October 2, 2022), and, to the extent applicable, to the historical earnings and cash flows associated with the assets acquired or disposed of, any related incurrence or
reduction of Indebtedness and any related cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies, all in accordance with (and, in the case of cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies, to the extent permitted by) Article 11 of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in
effect on the date of determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Swap Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness). 
 SECTION 1.05 Interest Rates . The Administrative Agent does not warrant, nor accept responsibility, nor shall the Administrative Agent
have any liability with respect to the administration, submission or any other matter related to any reference rate referred to herein or with respect to any rate (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the selection of such rate and any related
spread or other adjustment) that is an alternative or replacement for or successor to any such rate (including any Successor Rate) (or any component of any of the foregoing) or the effect of any of the foregoing, or of any Conforming Changes. The

any component of any of the foregoing) or any related spread or other adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to
ascertain any reference rate referred to herein or any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Successor Rate) (or any component of any of the foregoing), in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no
liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at

ARTICLE II 
 THE CREDITS SECTION 2.01
 Commitments . Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender (severally and not jointly) agrees to make Revolving Loans in Dollars to the Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period in an aggregate principal
amount that will not result (after giving effect to any application of proceeds of such Borrowing to any Swingline Loans outstanding pursuant to Section 2.10(a)) in (a) subject to Section 2.11(b), the amount of such Lender’s
Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding such Lender’s Commitment or (b) subject to Section 2.11(b), the amount of the Total Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding the Aggregate Commitment. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans. SECTION 2.02 Loans and Borrowings .
 (a) Each Revolving Loan (other than Swingline Loans) shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans
made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments
of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to make Loans as required. Any Swingline Loan shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05. 
 (b) Subject to Section 2.14, each Revolving Borrowing shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Term SOFR Loans as the
Borrower may request in accordance herewith. Each Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan. Each Lender at its option may make any Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan (and in the case of an
Affiliate, the provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 shall apply to such Affiliate to the same extent as to such Lender); provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Term SOFR
Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000. At the time that each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that
is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000; provided that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the Aggregate Commitment or that is required to finance
the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.06(e). Each Swingline Loan shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $1,000,000. Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may
be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more than a total of six (6) Term SOFR Borrowings outstanding. 
 (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to
convert or continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date. SECTION 2.03
 Requests for Revolving Borrowings . To request a Revolving Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request (a) by irrevocable written notice (via a written Borrowing Request signed by the Borrower promptly
followed by telephonic confirmation of such request) in the case of a Term SOFR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, two (2) Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) by telephone in the case of an ABR
Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of
a written Borrowing Request signed by the Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: 
   28
(i) the aggregate principal amount of the requested Borrowing; 
 (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day; 
 (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Term SOFR Borrowing; 
 (iv) in the case of a Term SOFR Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period
contemplated by the definition of “Interest Period”; and (v) the location and number of the Borrower’s
account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.07. If no election as to the Type of Revolving
Borrowing is specified, then the requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Term SOFR Revolving Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest
Period of one month’s duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s Loan to be made
as part of the requested Borrowing. SECTION 2.04 [Reserved] . 
 SECTION 2.05 Swingline Loans . 
 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request Swingline Loans in Dollars from time to time
during the Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $40,000,000, (ii) the Swingline Lender’s Revolving
Credit Exposure exceeding its Commitment or (iii) the Total Revolving Credit Exposure exceeding the Aggregate Commitment; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an outstanding
Swingline Loan. The Swingline Lender shall not be under any obligation to make any Swingline Loan if it shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that it has, or by such Credit Event may have,
Fronting Exposure. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow and reborrow Swingline Loans and prepay any Swingline Loan made to it. Each Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan.
Immediately upon the making of a Swingline Loan, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swingline Lender a risk participation in such Swingline Loan in an amount equal to the product
of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Swingline Loan. (b) Each Swingline Loan shall be made
upon the Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone or by a Borrowing Request; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the
Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent of a Borrowing Request. Each such Borrowing Request must be received by the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. New York City time on the requested borrowing date, and
shall specify (i) the 
   29
amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $1,000,000, and (ii) the requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Promptly after receipt by the Swingline Lender of any
Borrowing Request, the Swingline Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Borrowing Request and, if not, the Swingline Lender will notify the Administrative
Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swingline Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. New York City time on
the date of the proposed Swingline Borrowing (A) directing the Swingline Lender not to make such Swingline Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in Section 2.05, or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified
in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. New York City time on the borrowing date specified in such Borrowing Request, make the amount of its Swingline
Loan available to the Borrower. (c) Refinancing of Swingline Loans . 
 (i) The Swingline Lender at any time in its sole discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably
authorizes the Swingline Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender make an ABR Loan in an amount equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing
(which written request shall be deemed to be a Borrowing Request for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of ABR Loans,
but subject to the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitment and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swingline Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the applicable Borrowing Request promptly after delivering such
notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the amount specified in such Borrowing Request available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply
cash collateral available with respect to the applicable Swingline Loan) for the account of the Swingline Lender at the Administrative Agent’s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. New York City time on the day specified in such Borrowing Request,
whereupon, subject to Section 2.05(c)(ii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a ABR Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender.
 (ii) If for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Borrowing in accordance with
Section 2.05(c)(i), the request for ABR Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and
each Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. 
 (iii) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount
required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.05(c) by the time specified in Section 2.05(c)(i), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the
Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the greater of
 
   30
the applicable Overnight Bank Funding Rate from time to time in effect and a rate determined by the Swingline Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any
administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swingline Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s
Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swingline Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing
under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (iv) Each Lender’s obligation to make an ABR
Loan or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment,
defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that each Lender’s obligation to make ABR Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No such funding of risk
participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein. 
 (d) Repayment of Participations . 
 (i) At any time after any Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline Lender
receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swingline Lender. 
 (ii) If any payment received by the Swingline Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to
be returned by the Swingline Lender under any of the circumstances (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Swingline Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on
demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Bank Funding Rate from time to time in effect. The Administrative Agent
will make such demand upon the request of the Swingline Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
 (e) Interest for Account of Swingline Lender . The Swingline Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Borrower for
interest on the Swingline Loans. Until each Lender funds its ABR Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.05 to refinance such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of any Swingline Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable
Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swingline Lender. (f) Payments Directly to Swingline Lender . The
Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swingline Loans directly to the Swingline Lender (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in
Section 2.06(e), by remittance to the relevant Issuing Bank). 
   31

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Issuing Bank shall have any obligation hereunder to issue, and shall not issue, any Letter of Credit the proceeds of which would be made available to any Person (i) to fund or finance any
activity, business or transaction of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in any country or territory that, at the time of such funding, is a Sanctioned Country, to the extent such activity, business or transaction would be prohibited by Sanctions by a
Person organized or formed under the laws of the United States, (ii) in any manner that would result in a violation of any Sanctions by any party to this Agreement or (iii) in any manner that would result in a violation (as reasonably
determined by such Issuing Bank in good faith) of one or more Sanctions-related policies of such Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally (it being agreed that, upon request by the Company, such Issuing Bank shall deliver a certificate
setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for any non-issuance pursuant to this clause (iii)). 
 (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions . To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit
(or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Company shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the relevant Issuing Bank) to the

issuance of letters of credit and/or shall submit a letter of credit application, in each case, as required by the relevant Issuing Bank and using such Issuing Bank’s standard form (each, a “ Letter of Credit Agreement ”). A
Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Company shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (i) subject to Section 2.11(b), the amount of the LC Exposure shall not exceed $50,000,000, (ii) subject to Section 2.11(b), the amount of the Total Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed the
Aggregate Commitment, (iii) subject to Section 2.11(b), the amount of each Lender’s Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed such Lender’s Commitment and (iv) the aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit issued and
then outstanding by any Issuing Bank shall not exceed such Issuing Bank’s Applicable LC Sublimit, unless such excess is consented to, or otherwise waived, by such Issuing Bank in its sole discretion. 
   32
(c) Expiration Date . Each Letter of Credit shall expire (or be
subject to termination by notice from the relevant Issuing Bank to the beneficiary thereof) at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year (or such longer period as may be consented to by the relevant Issuing Bank)
after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date;
 provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may contain customary automatic renewal provisions agreed upon by the Company and the relevant Issuing Bank that provide for the renewal thereof
for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event extend beyond the date referenced in clause (ii) above), subject to a right on the part of such Issuing Bank to prevent any such renewal from
occurring by giving notice to the beneficiary in advance of any such renewal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Letter of Credit may expire no later than one year after the Maturity Date so long as the Company cash collateralizes an amount equal to
103% of the face amount of such Letter of Credit, concurrently with the issuance of such Letter of Credit, in the manner described in Section 2.06(j) and otherwise on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the relevant Issuing Bank and
the Administrative Agent or provides a backup letter of credit in such amount and otherwise in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the relevant Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent, in each case no later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Maturity Date. (d) Participations . By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter
of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the relevant Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the relevant Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a
participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely
and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the relevant Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Company on the date due
as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Company for any reason (any such amount the “ Unreimbursed Amount ”). Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. 
 (e) Reimbursement . If the relevant Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the
Company shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement, calculated as of the date such Issuing Bank made such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the Business
Day immediately following the Business Day that the Company shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement; provided that the Company may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with
Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing, Term SOFR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an amount equal to such LC Disbursement, to the extent so financed, the Company’s obligation to make
such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing, Term SOFR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan, as applicable. If the Company fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each
Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Company in respect thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its
Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Company, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis , to the payment obligations of
the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the relevant Issuing Bank the amounts so received by 
   33
it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Company pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to
the relevant Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to
this paragraph to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to
reimburse such LC Disbursement. (f) Obligations Absolute . The Company’s obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, any Letter of Credit Agreement or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein or herein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of
Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) any payment by the relevant Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or
other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a
legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Company’s obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Banks, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or
responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any
error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in
interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the relevant Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the relevant Issuing Bank from liability to the Company to
the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Company that are caused by
such Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of any Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without
limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, each Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either
accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict
compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. (g) Disbursement Procedures . Each Issuing Bank shall, within
the time allowed by applicable laws or the specific terms of the Letter of Credit following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. Each Issuing Bank shall promptly after such
examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Company by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give
or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. 
   34
(h) Interim Interest . If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Company shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full within one Business Day of the date on which such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date
such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the reimbursement is due and payable, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans and such interest shall be due and payable on the date when such reimbursement is payable;
 provided that, if the Company fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the
relevant Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
 (i) Replacement of Issuing Bank . 
 (A) Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Company, the Administrative Agent, the replaced
Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of any Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Company shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for
the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this
Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all
previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this
Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit then outstanding and issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. 
 (B) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, any Issuing Bank may resign as an Issuing Bank at
any time upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Company and the Lenders, in which case, such Issuing Bank shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.06(i)(A) above. 
 (j) Cash Collateralization . If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Company
receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral
pursuant to this paragraph, the Company shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders (the “ LC Collateral Account ”), an amount in cash equal to
103% of the amount of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due
and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with 
   35
respect to the Company described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one Business Day following the written request of the
Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall cash collateralize the Issuing Bank’s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in an amount not less than 103% of the amount
of the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Company also shall deposit cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph as and to the extent required by Section 2.11(b). Such deposit shall be held by the
Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned
on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option of the Company with the consent of the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion and at the Company’s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear
interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the relevant Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been
reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Company for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of
Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations. If the Company is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of
Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three (3) Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Company is required to provide an amount of cash
collateral hereunder pursuant to Section 2.11(b), such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company as and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposures
would not exceed the Aggregate Commitment and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. (k) Issuing
Bank Agreements . Each Issuing Bank agrees that, unless otherwise requested by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank shall report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) on the first Business Day of each week, the daily activity
(set forth by day) in respect of Letters of Credit during the immediately preceding week, including all issuances, extensions, amendments and renewals, all expirations and cancellations and all disbursements and reimbursements, (ii) on or prior
to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank expects to issue, amend, renew or extend any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and the aggregate face amount of the Letters of Credit to be issued, amended,
renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension occurred (and whether the amount thereof changed), (iii) on each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank pays any amount in respect of
one or more drawings under Letters of Credit, the date of such payment(s) and the amount of such payment(s), (iv) on any Business Day on which the Company fails to reimburse any amount required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the
date of such failure and the amount of such payment in respect of Letters of Credit, (v) at any time any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank is outstanding, on the last Business Day of each calendar month, information regarding the
amount, expiry date, beneficiary and such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request with respect to each such Letter of Credit and (vi) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent
shall reasonably request. 
   36
(l) Letters of Credit Issued for Account of Subsidiaries .
Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder supports any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, or states that a Subsidiary is the “account party,” “applicant,” “customer,”
“instructing party,” or the like of or for such Letter of Credit, and without derogating from any rights of any Issuing Bank (whether arising by contract, at law, in equity or otherwise) against such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of
Credit, the Company (i) shall reimburse, indemnify and compensate the relevant Issuing Bank hereunder for such Letter of Credit (including to reimburse any and all drawings thereunder) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as if such
Letter of Credit had been issued solely for the account of the Company and (ii) irrevocably waives any and all defenses to the extent permitted by applicable law that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor or surety of any or all of
the obligations of such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit. The Company hereby acknowledges that the issuance of such Letters of Credit for its Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Company, and that the Company’s business
derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries. (m) Limitations on Issuance and Amendment .
 (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to issue any Letter of
Credit if: (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to
enjoin or restrain such Issuing Bank from issuing the Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to such Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such
Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to the Letter of Credit any
restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not
applicable on the Effective Date and which such Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it; (B) the issuance of such
Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally; (C)
except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and such Issuing Bank, the Letter of Credit is in an initial stated amount less than $500,000; 
 (D) any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless such Issuing Bank has entered into arrangements, including the
delivery of cash collateral, satisfactory to such Issuing Bank (in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such Lender to eliminate such Issuing Bank’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.24(d)) with
respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit as to which such Issuing Bank has actual or potential LC Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion; or 
 (E) the Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing
thereunder. (ii) No Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) such Issuing Bank
would have no obligation at such time to issue the Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit. 
   37
SECTION 2.07 Funding of Borrowings . 
 (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof solely by wire transfer of Same
Day Funds, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05.
Except in respect of the provisions of this Agreement covering the reimbursement of Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the funds so received in the aforesaid account of
the Administrative Agent to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e)
shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the relevant Issuing Bank. (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing (or in the case of an ABR Borrowing, prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative
Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Overnight Bank Funding Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the
interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the
Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. SECTION 2.08
 Interest Elections . (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing
Request and, in the case of a Term SOFR Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in
the case of a Term SOFR Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be
allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or
continued. 
   38
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify
the Administrative Agent of such election (by telephone or irrevocable written notice from the Borrower) by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type
resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written
Interest Election Request signed by the Borrower. Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Section shall not be construed to permit the Borrower to (i) elect an Interest Period for Term SOFR Loans that does not comply with
Section 2.02(d) or (ii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a Type not available under such Borrowing. (c)
Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02: 
 (i) the name of the Borrower and the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are
being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each
resulting Borrowing); (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall
be a Business Day; (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Term SOFR Borrowing; and 
 (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Term SOFR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to
such election, which Interest Period shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”. If any such
Interest Election Request requests a Term SOFR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration. 
 (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the
details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing. (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a
timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Term SOFR Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be
converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an
Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Term SOFR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Term SOFR Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, but without duplication for interest payments made by the Borrower on such amount. 
   39
SECTION 2.09 Termination and Reduction of Commitments . 
 (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date. 
 (b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each
reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment
of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the amount of the Total Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the Aggregate Commitment. 
 (c) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph
(b) of this Section by no later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt
of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered
by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or one or more other events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent
on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Commitments. SECTION 2.10 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt . 
 (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender
the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan made to the Borrower on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan made to the Borrower on the earlier to occur of
(x) the date ten (10) Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made and (y) the Maturity Date; provided that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans made to the Borrower
then outstanding and the proceeds of any such Borrowing shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to repay any Swingline Loans outstanding. At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately upon the request of the Swingline
Lender, the Borrower shall repay the outstanding Swingline Loans made by the Swingline Lender in an amount sufficient to eliminate any Fronting Exposure in respect of such Swingline Loans. 
 (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the
Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. 
 (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder,
the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any
sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof. 
 (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima
facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the
Obligations. 
   40
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it to the Borrower be
evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender and its registered assigns and in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G . Thereafter, the
Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein and its
registered assigns. SECTION 2.11 Prepayment of Loans . 
 (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, without
premium or penalty (but subject to break funding payments required by Section 2.16) subject to prior notice in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.11(a). The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of
prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Term SOFR Revolving Borrowing, by telephonic notice (promptly followed by written confirmation from the Borrower of such
request) not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, two (2) Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, by telephonic notice (promptly followed by written confirmation from the
Borrower of such request) not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, by telephonic notice (promptly followed by written confirmation from the Borrower of such
request) not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice from the Borrower shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be
prepaid by the Borrower; provided that any such notice of prepayment delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or one or more other events specified therein, in which
case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing,
the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as
provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by (i) accrued interest to the extent required by
Section 2.13 and (ii) break funding payments to the extent required by Section 2.16. (b) If at any time,
the aggregate principal amount of the Total Revolving Credit Exposure exceeds the Aggregate Commitment, the Company shall, within two (2) Business Days after receiving notice from the Administrative Agent in respect thereof, repay Borrowings or
cash collateralize LC Exposure in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.06(j), as applicable, in an aggregate principal amount sufficient to cause the amount of the Total Revolving Credit Exposure (so calculated) to be
less than or equal to the Aggregate Commitment. SECTION 2.12 Fees . 
 (a) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable
Percentage a facility fee, which shall accrue at the applicable Facility Fee Rate (as specified in the definition of “Applicable Rate”) on the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Commitment (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, on
the Total Revolving Credit Exposure) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which the Commitments terminate (and thereafter so long as any Revolving Credit Exposure remains outstanding), whether or not
in use. Facility fees accrued through and 
   41
including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable in arrears on the tenth (10 th ) day following such
last day and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that any facility fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on
demand. All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). 
 (b) The Company agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with
respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Term SOFR Revolving Loans on the actual daily amount of such Lender’s LC Exposure (excluding
any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender’s Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender
ceases to have any LC Exposure and (ii) to the relevant Issuing Bank for its own account a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.125% per annum on the actual daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the
date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Bank’s standard fees and commissions with respect to the issuance, amendment, cancellation, negotiation, transfer, presentment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on or prior to the tenth (10 th ) Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments
terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within ten (10) days after demand. All
participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). 
 (c) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times
separately agreed upon between the Company and the Administrative Agent from time to time. (d) All fees payable hereunder
shall be paid on the dates due, in Dollars and Same Day Funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to each Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid
shall not be refundable under any circumstances. To the extent any calculation of any fee required to be paid under this Agreement shall be based on (or result in) a calculation that is less than zero, such calculation shall be deemed zero for
purposes of this Agreement. SECTION 2.13 Interest . 
 (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate
plus the Applicable Rate. (b) The Loans comprising each Term SOFR Borrowing shall bear interest at Term SOFR for the
Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate. 
   42
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any
Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal
to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR
Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section. (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable by the Borrower on demand, (ii) in the event of any
repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and
(iii) in the event of any conversion of any Term SOFR Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. 
 (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to
the Alternate Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Each determination of an
interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. To the extent any calculation of interest shall be based on (or
result in) a calculation that is less than zero, such calculation shall be deemed zero for purposes of this Agreement. SECTION 2.14
 Alternate Rate of Interest . (a) If in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Loan or a conversion to or
continuation thereof, (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (A) no Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 2.14(c), and the circumstances
under clause (i) of Section 2.14(c) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred, or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Term SOFR Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed ABR Loan, or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason that Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Loan does
not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (1) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans,
or to convert ABR Loans to Term SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods), and (2) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR
component of the Alternate Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Alternate Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Lenders
described in clause (ii) of this Section 2.14(a), until the Administrative Agent upon instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a
Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Term SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of ABR Loans in the
amount specified therein and (y) any outstanding Term SOFR Loans shall be deemed to have been converted to ABR Loans immediately at the end of their respective applicable Interest Period. 
   43
(b) [Reserved]. 
 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent
determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Lenders
(as applicable) have determined, that: (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR, including because the Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published
on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or (ii) CME or any successor administrator of the Term SOFR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator
with respect to its publication of Term SOFR, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate
shall or will no longer be made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of Dollar-denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease; provided that at the time of such statement, there is no successor
administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide such interest periods of Term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date on which one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR or
the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer available permanently or indefinitely, the “ Scheduled Unavailability Date ”); then, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the “ Term SOFR Replacement
Date ”), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability
Date, Term SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any other Loan Document with Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case, without any
amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the “ Successor Rate ”). If the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment, all interest payments will be
payable on a monthly basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (a) if the Administrative Agent
determines that Daily Simple SOFR is not available on or prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date, or (b) if the events or circumstances of the type described in clause (i) or clause (ii) of the immediately preceding paragraph have
occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing Term SOFR or any then current Successor Rate in accordance with
this Section 2.14(c) at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then-existing
convention for similar Dollar-denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such alternative benchmark and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to
any evolving or then-existing convention for similar Dollar-denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments shall constitute a
“Successor Rate”. Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior
to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. 
   44
The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the
Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate. Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the
Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less
than zero, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming
Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this
Agreement; provided that with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment
becomes effective. For purposes of this Section 2.14(c), those Lenders that either have not made, or do not have an
obligation under this Agreement to make, the relevant Loans in Dollars shall be excluded from any determination of Required Lenders. 
 SECTION 2.15 Increased Costs . 
 (a) If any Change in Law shall: 
 (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity or similar requirement (including any compulsory
loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any Issuing Bank; 
 (ii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank or the applicable interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other
than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; or 
 (iii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses
(b) through (d) of the definition of “Excluded Taxes” and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital
attributable thereto; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of
making, continuing, converting into or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan or to increase the cost to such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any
Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient hereunder, whether of principal, interest or otherwise, then the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such Issuing Bank
or such other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, such Issuing Bank or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered as reasonably
determined by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank (which determination shall be made in good faith (and not on an arbitrary or capricious basis) and generally consistent with similarly situated customers of the Administrative
Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, under agreements having provisions similar to this Section 2.15, after consideration of such factors as the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, then
reasonably determines to be relevant). 
   45
(b) If any Lender or any Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law
regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company, if
any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that
which such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s policies and the
policies of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s holding company for any such reduction suffered as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank
(which determination shall be made in good faith (and not on an arbitrary or capricious basis) and generally consistent with similarly situated customers of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, under agreements
having provisions similar to this Section 2.15, after consideration of such factors as the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as applicable, then reasonably determines to be relevant). 
 (c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis and calculation of the amount
or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such Issuing Bank or its respective holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The Company shall pay such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof. 
 (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Company shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased
costs or reductions incurred more than 120 days prior to the date that such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or
such Issuing Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided , further , that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 120-day 
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. SECTION 2.16 Break Funding
Payments . In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Term SOFR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or as a result of any prepayment pursuant to
Section 2.11), (b) the conversion of any Term SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Term SOFR Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(a) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Term SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.19(b) or Section 9.02(d), then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event (other
than loss of anticipated profits). Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall include any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or redeployment of funds obtained by 
   46
it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations used by such Lender to determine such amount or amounts, shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The
Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any
amounts under this Section 2.16 incurred more than 120 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such amount and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor. 
 SECTION 2.17 Taxes . 
 (a) Payments Free of Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan
Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding
of any Tax from any such payment by a withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority
in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.17(a)) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
 (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower . The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
 (c) Evidence of Payments . As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or by the Administrative
Agent to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.17, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt
issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as the case may be. 
 (d) Indemnification by the Borrower . The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 10 days after demand therefor,
for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.17) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment
to such Recipient and any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and calculation of the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
   47
(e) Indemnification by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally
indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such
Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register
and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or
not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source
against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph (e). (f) Status of Lenders . 
 (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any
Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or
information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A),
(ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense (it being understood that the Borrower shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to reimburse such Lender with respect to such cost or expense) or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. 
 (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person: 
 (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on
which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of any the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), duly executed copies of IRS Form W-9 
certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the
extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to each the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this
Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of each the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: 
   48
(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax
treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, duly executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable
payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S.
federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; 
 (2) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming that its extension of credit will generate U.S. effectively connected income,
duly executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI; (3) in the case of a Foreign Lender
claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such Foreign
Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign
corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “ U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate ”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E; or (4) to the extent a Foreign Lender
is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3 , IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or
more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit
 E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign
Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to each the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a
Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of any the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a
reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit each the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction
required to be made; and 
   49
(D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject
to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall
deliver to each the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by any the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by any the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for each the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to
comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D),
“FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the Effective Date. Each Lender agrees that if any form
or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
 (g) Treatment of Certain Refunds . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it
has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.17 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to
such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
 out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect
to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant
Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to
pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would
have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This
paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
 (h) Survival . Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive the resignation or replacement of
the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document. 
 (i) Defined Terms . For purposes of this Section 2.17, the term “Lender” includes each Issuing Bank and
the term “applicable law” includes FATCA. 
   50
SECTION 2.18 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs . (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m., New York City time on the date when due, in Same Day Funds, without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for
purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made in Dollars to the Administrative Agent’s Office, except payments to be made directly to any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except
that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate
recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by
and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably
among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties. 
 (c) Subject to Section 2.24(b), if any Lender shall, by exercising any right of
 set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender
receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such
payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that
(i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of
this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation relating to any Obligations owed by the Borrower pursuant to the
foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of
such participation. (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on
which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date
in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. With respect to any payment that the 
   51
Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the “ Rescindable Amount ”): (i) the Borrower has not in fact made such payment; (ii) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so
paid by the Borrower (whether or not then owed); or (iii) the Administrative Agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment; then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to
repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Overnight Bank Funding Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (d) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e),
2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Banks to satisfy such Lender’s obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a
segregated account over which the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive control as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section; in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii)
above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion. SECTION 2.19 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of
Lenders . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is required to pay any
Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender gives notice pursuant to Section 2.22, then such Lender shall use reasonable
efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, such
designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 2.22 and (ii) would not subject
such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or
assignment. (b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay
any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and
effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than
its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
 provided that (A) to the extent such consent would be required pursuant to Section 9.04(b), the Company shall have received the prior written 
   52
consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Banks), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned,
(B) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it
hereunder (including amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.16), from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts) and (C) in the case of any such
assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to
make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an
assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the assignee (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and
Assumption by reference pursuant to an Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants), and the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and
shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof; provided that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence
such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender; provided , further , that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.19(b) or
Section 9.02(d) to the contrary, (x) any Lender that acts as an Issuing Bank may not be replaced hereunder at any time it has any Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements satisfactory to such Lender (including the
furnishing of a backstop standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer, reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank or the depositing of cash collateral in amounts and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to
such Issuing Bank) have been made with respect to such outstanding Letter of Credit and (y) the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder, in its capacity as such, except in accordance with the terms of Section 8.01. 
 SECTION 2.20 Expansion Option . The Company may from time to time elect to increase the Commitments or enter into one or more tranches
of term loans (each, an “ Incremental Term Loan ”) pursuant to an Incremental Facility Amendment and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, in each case in minimum increments of $50,000,000 so long as, after giving effect thereto,
the aggregate amount of all such increases and all such Incremental Term Loans does not exceed $250,000,000. The Company may arrange for any such increase or tranche to be provided by one or more Lenders (each Lender so agreeing to an increase in
its Commitment, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, an “ Increasing Lender ”), or by one or more new banks, financial institutions or other entities (each such new bank, financial institution or other entity, an
“ Augmenting Lender ”; provided that no Ineligible Institution may be an Augmenting Lender), which agree to increase their existing Commitments, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, or provide new Commitments, as
the case may be; provided that (i) each Augmenting Lender shall be subject to the approval of the Company, the Administrative Agent and, if the Augmenting Lender is providing a new or increased Commitment with respect to Revolving Loans,
the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Banks (such approvals not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (ii) (x) in the case of an Increasing Lender, the Company and such Increasing Lender execute an agreement substantially in
the form of Exhibit B hereto, and (y) in the case of an Augmenting Lender, the Company and such Augmenting Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto. No consent of any Lender (other than the Lenders
participating in the increase or any Incremental Term Loan) shall be required for any increase in Commitments or Incremental Term Loan pursuant to this Section 2.20. Increases and new Commitments and Incremental Term Loans created
 
   53
pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall become effective on the date agreed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders (as the case may
be), and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender) or tranche of Incremental Term Loans shall become effective under this paragraph
unless, (A) on the proposed date of the effectiveness of such increase or Incremental Term Loans, (1) the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied or waived by the Required Lenders and the
Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate on behalf of the Company to that effect dated such date and executed by a Responsible Officer of the Company and (2) the Company shall be in compliance (on a pro forma basis, giving effect
to the proviso in Section 6.04(a) if the proceeds from the applicable increase in the Commitments or Incremental Term Loan, as the case may be, are to be applied to fund the consideration for a Qualified Acquisition for which the Total Leverage
Ratio is being increased pursuant to such proviso) with the covenant contained in Section 6.04 and (B) to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall have received documents and opinions of
the same type, to the extent applicable, as those delivered on the Effective Date as to the organizational power and authority of the Borrower to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase (or to the extent the resolutions delivered on
the Effective Date approve such matters, a certification from the Borrower that the resolutions delivered on the Effective Date remain in full force and effect and have not been amended or otherwise modified since the adoption thereof). 
 On the effective date of any increase in the Commitments or any Incremental Term Loans being made, (a) each relevant Increasing Lender
and Augmenting Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in Same Day Funds as the Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such
increase and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other Lenders, each Lender’s portion of the outstanding Revolving Loans of all the Lenders to equal its Applicable Percentage of such outstanding Revolving Loans, and (b) the
Borrower shall be deemed to have repaid and reborrowed all outstanding Revolving Loans owed by the Borrower as of the date of any increase in the Commitments (with such reborrowing to consist of the Types of Revolving Loans, with related Interest
Periods if applicable, specified in a notice delivered by the Borrower, together with the Company, in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.03). The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (b) of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, in respect of each Term SOFR Loan, shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.16 if the deemed payment occurs
other than on the last day of the related Interest Periods. The Incremental Term Loans (i) shall rank pari passu in right of payment with the Revolving Loans, (ii) shall not mature earlier than the Maturity Date (but may have amortization
and/or customary prepayments prior to such date) and (iii) subject to the foregoing clause (ii), shall be treated substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably than) the Revolving Loans; provided that (A) the terms
and conditions applicable to any tranche of Incremental Term Loans maturing after the Maturity Date may provide for material additional or different financial or other covenants or prepayment requirements applicable only during periods after the
Maturity Date and (B) the Incremental Term Loans may be priced differently (whether in the form of interest rate margin, upfront fees, original issue discount, call protection or otherwise) than the Revolving Loans. The Incremental Facility
Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of
this Section 2.20. Nothing contained in this Section 2.20 shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any Lender to increase its Commitment hereunder, or provide Incremental Term Loans, at any time. 
   54
SECTION 2.21 Extension of Maturity Date . 
 (a) Requests for Extension . The Company may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the
Lenders) at any time (each such date, an “ Extension Date ”), request that each Lender extend such Lender’s Maturity Date to the date that is one year after the Maturity Date then in effect for such Lender (the “ Existing
Maturity Date ”); provided that (i) any such request shall be made no later than 30 days prior to the applicable Existing Maturity Date and (ii) no more than two (2) extensions of the Maturity Date shall be permitted
hereunder. (b) Lender Elections to Extend . Each Lender, acting in its sole and individual discretion, shall, by
notice to the Administrative Agent given not later than the date that is 15 days after the date on which the Administrative Agent received the Company’s extension request (the “ Lender Notice Date ”), advise the Administrative
Agent whether or not such Lender agrees to such extension (each Lender that determines to so extend its Maturity Date, an “ Extending Lender ”). Each Lender that determines not to so extend its Maturity Date (a “ Non-Extending Lender ”) shall notify the Administrative Agent of such fact promptly after such determination (but in any event no later than the Lender Notice Date), and any Lender that does not so advise
the Administrative Agent on or before the Lender Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender. The election of any Lender to agree to such extension shall not obligate any other Lender to so agree,
and it is understood and agreed that no Lender shall have any obligation whatsoever to agree to any request made by the Company for extension of the Maturity Date. 
 (c) Notification by Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent shall notify the Company of each Lender’s
determination under this Section no later than the date that is 15 days prior to the applicable Extension Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day). 
 (d) Additional Commitment Lenders . The Company shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, on or before the
applicable Maturity Date for any Non-Extending Lender to replace such Non-Extending Lender with, and add as “Lenders” under this Agreement in place thereof,
one or more financial institutions that are not Ineligible Institutions (each, an “ Additional Commitment Lender ”) approved by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the procedures provided in Section 2.19(b), each of which
Additional Commitment Lenders shall have entered into an Assignment and Assumption (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04, with the Company or replacement Lender obligated to pay any applicable processing
or recordation fee) with such Non-Extending Lender, pursuant to which such Additional Commitment Lenders shall, effective on or before the applicable Maturity Date for such
 Non-Extending Lender, assume a Commitment (and, if any such Additional Commitment Lender is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Lender’s Commitment hereunder on such date). Prior
to any Non-Extending Lender being replaced by one or more Additional Commitment Lenders pursuant hereto, such Non-Extending Lender may elect, in its sole discretion, by
giving irrevocable notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Company (which notice shall set forth such Lender’s new Maturity Date), to become an Extending Lender. The Administrative Agent may effect such amendments to this Agreement
as are reasonably necessary to provide for any such extensions with the consent of the Company but without the consent of any other Lenders. 
 (e) Effective Date of Extension . Effective as of the applicable Extension Date, the Maturity Date of each Extending
Lender and of each Additional Commitment Lender shall be extended to the date that is one year after the Existing Maturity Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Maturity Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business
Day) and each Additional Commitment Lender shall thereupon become a “Lender” for all purposes of this Agreement and shall be bound by the provisions of this Agreement as a Lender hereunder and shall have the obligations of a Lender
hereunder. 
   55
(f) Conditions to Effectiveness of Extension . Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any extension of any Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall not be effective with respect to any Extending Lender unless: 
 (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the applicable Extension Date and immediately after
giving effect thereto; and (ii) the representations and warranties of the Borrower set forth in this Agreement (excluding
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.04(b) and 3.06(a)) are true and correct in all material respects (or, in the case of any representation or warranty qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect, in all respects) on
and as of the applicable Extension Date and after giving effect thereto, as though made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date); and
 (iii) the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate from the Company signed by a Responsible Officer of the
Company, delivered on behalf of the Company, (A) certifying the accuracy of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) and (B) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or consenting to such extension (or to
the extent the resolutions delivered on the Effective Date approve such matters, a certification from the Borrower that the resolutions delivered on the Effective Date remain in full force and effect and have not been amended or otherwise modified
since the adoption thereof). (g) Maturity Date for Non-Extending Lenders .
On the Maturity Date of each Non-Extending Lender, (i) the Commitment of each Non-Extending Lender shall automatically terminate and (ii) the Company shall
repay such Non-Extending Lender in accordance with Section 2.10 (and shall pay to such Non-Extending Lender all of the other Obligations owing to it under this
Agreement) and after giving effect thereto shall prepay any Revolving Loans outstanding on such date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.16) to the extent necessary to keep outstanding Revolving Loans ratable with any
revised Applicable Percentages of the respective Lenders effective as of such date, and the Administrative Agent shall administer any necessary reallocation of the Revolving Credit Exposures (without regard to any minimum borrowing, pro rata
borrowing and/or pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement). (h) Conflicting Provisions .
This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.18 or Section 9.02 to the contrary. SECTION 2.22 Illegality . If
any Lender determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference
to SOFR or Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR or Term SOFR, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Administrative Agent), (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term SOFR
Loans or to convert ABR Loans to Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component
of the Alternate Base Rate, the interest rate on ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case
until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand
 
   56
from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term SOFR Loans of such Lender to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender
shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully
continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loan to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loan, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates
based upon SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Alternate Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing
by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together
with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 2.16. SECTION 2.23 [Reserved] . 
 SECTION 2.24 Defaulting Lenders . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: (a) fees shall cease
to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a) (it being understood and agreed that, with respect to any fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to this clause
(a), the Borrower shall pay to each non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Swingline Exposure and LC
Exposure that has been reallocated to such non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) below); 
 (b) any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.08 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the
Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing
Banks or the Swingline Lender hereunder; third, to cash collateralize the relevant Issuing Bank’s LC Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with this Section; fourth, as the Company may request (so long as no Default or
Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; fifth, if so determined by the
Administrative Agent and the Company, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) cash
collateralize the relevant Issuing Bank’s future LC Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with this Section; sixth, to the payment of any amounts
owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or the Swingline Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such
Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document; seventh, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Company as a result of any judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Company against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document; and eighth, to such Defaulting
Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if 
   57
(x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or LC Disbursements in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such
Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and LC Disbursements owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or LC Disbursements owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded
participations in the Borrower’s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure and Swingline Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments without giving effect to clause (d) below. Any
payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such
Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto; (c) the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such
Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); provided 
that any amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or all Lenders directly affected thereby shall not, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02, require the consent of such Defaulting Lender in accordance
with the terms hereof; (d) if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender then: (i) all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated
among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that (A) no Default or Event of Default shall be continuing at the time of such
reallocation and (B) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender’s Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders’ Commitments; (ii) if the reallocation described in clause
(i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize for the
benefit of each relevant Issuing Bank only 103% of the Borrower’s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 2.06(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding; (iii) if the Company cash
collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting
Lender’s LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is cash collateralized; (iv) if the
LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such
 non-Defaulting Lenders’ Applicable Percentages; and 
   58
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure is
neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the relevant Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under
Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s LC Exposure shall be payable to such Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and 
 (e) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no
Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender’s then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Company in accordance with Section 2.24(d), and Swingline Exposure related to any such newly made Swingline Loan or LC Exposure related to
any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.24(d)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
 If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a Lender Parent shall occur following the Effective Date and for so long as such event
shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or any Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Swingline
Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and no Issuing Bank shall be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless Swingline Lender or the relevant Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have entered into
arrangements with the Company or such Lender, reasonably satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder. 
 In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company, the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has
adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Commitment and on such date such Lender
shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage,
whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender;
 provided , further , that subject to Section 9.17 and except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of
any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender. ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
 The Company, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, represents and warrants to the Lenders that: 
 SECTION 3.01 Organization; Powers; Subsidiaries . Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized or incorporated,
as the case may be, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent the concept is applicable in such jurisdiction) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation (as applicable), (b) has all requisite organizational
power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and (c) is qualified to do business in, and (to the extent the concept is applicable in such jurisdiction) is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or
operation of properties 
   59
or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, in any such case of clauses (a) (solely with respect to the good standing status of any Subsidiary), (b) (solely with respect to the
power and authority of any Subsidiary) and (c), except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 3.01 hereto identifies each Subsidiary as of the Effective Date, the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be, the percentage of issued and outstanding shares of each class of its capital stock or other equity interests owned by the Company and the other Subsidiaries and, if such
percentage is not 100% (excluding (i) directors’ qualifying shares and (ii) shares issued to foreign nationals to the extent required by applicable law), a description of each class issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock and other equity interests of each Material Subsidiary are validly issued and outstanding and fully paid and nonassessable and all such shares and other equity interests indicated on Schedule 3.01 as owned by the
Company or another Subsidiary are owned, beneficially and of record, by the Company or any Subsidiary as of the Effective Date free and clear of all Liens, other than Liens permitted pursuant to Section 6.02. 
 SECTION 3.02 Authorization; Enforceability . The Transactions are within the Borrower’s organizational powers and have been duly
authorized by all necessary organizational actions and, if required, actions by equity holders of the Borrower. The Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, examinership, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, (ii) general principles of
equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law and (iii) requirements of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing. 
 SECTION 3.03 Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts . The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or
filing with, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been, or will be by the time required, obtained or made and are, or will be by the time required, in full force and effect, except, in the case of this clause (a),
for any such consents, approvals, registrations, filings or actions the failure to obtain or make of which could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (b) will not violate the charter,
 by-laws, constitution or other organizational documents of the Borrower, (c) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or any order of any Governmental Authority binding upon the Borrower or any
of the Material Subsidiaries or its assets, except, in the case of this clause (c), for any such violations that could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (d) will not violate in any material respect or result in
a default under any indenture, material agreement or other material instrument binding upon the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by the Company or any of
its Material Subsidiaries, except, in the case of this clause (d), for any such violations, defaults or rights that could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (e) will not result in the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its Material Subsidiaries, other than Liens (if any) permitted by Section 6.02(a). 
 SECTION 3.04 Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change . 
 (a) The Company has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations,
stockholders equity and cash flows as of and for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022 reported on by Ernst & Young LLP, independent public accountants. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the end of such fiscal year and their results of operations for such fiscal year on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. 
   60
(b) As of the Effective Date and excluding any Disclosed Matters, since
January 2, 2022, there has been no material adverse change in the business, results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 ARTICLE VIII THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT SECTION 8.01 General . 
 (a) Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the
Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof,
together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article VIII are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a
third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to
connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship
between contracting parties. (b) The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and
powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context
otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other
advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind banking, trust, financial, advisory, underwriting or other of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent
hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders or to provide notice or consent of the Lenders with respect thereto. 
   78
(c) None of the Administrative Agent or any Joint Bookrunner, as applicable,
shall have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the Administrative
Agent, any Joint Bookrunner, or any of their respective Related Parties: (i) shall be subject to any fiduciary or other
implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; (ii) shall have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its
opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under
any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; 
 (iii) shall have any duty or responsibility to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, to any Lender or
any Issuing Bank, any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, that is communicated to, obtained or in the
possession of, the Administrative Agent, any Joint Bookrunner, or any of their respective Related Parties in any capacity, except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent
herein; (iv) shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with
this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the
Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Article VII and Section 9.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment, and the Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the
Company, a Lender or an Issuing Bank; and (v) shall be responsible for or have any duty or obligation to any Lender or
participant or any other Person to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other
document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any
Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or
elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. 
   79
(d) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be
genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall
not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the
satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or
such Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and
shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. 
 (e) The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any
other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their
respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article VIII shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection
with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
 sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the
selection of such sub-agents. (f) The Administrative Agent may at any time give
notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided that no consent of the Company shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank
with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such
earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders and the Company) (the “ Resignation Effective Date ”), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks,
appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such
resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. (g) If the Person
serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person remove such Person
as Administrative 
   80
Agent and, with the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that no consent of the Company shall be required if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing), appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders and
the Company) (the “ Removal Effective Date ”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. 
 (h) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the retiring or
removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (ii) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent,
all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each Issuing Bank directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of
the retiring (or removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 2.17(e) and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date
or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided
above in clauses (f) and (g)). The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the retiring or
removed Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article VIII and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative
Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them (A) while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent and (B) after such
resignation or removal for as long as any of them continues to act in any capacity hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, including in respect of any actions taken in connection with transferring the agency to any successor Administrative
Agent. (i) Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 8.01 shall also
constitute its resignation as an Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender. If Bank of America resigns as an Issuing Bank, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an Issuing Bank hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit
outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an Issuing Bank and all LC Exposure with respect thereto, including the right to require the Lenders to make ABR Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to
Section 2.06(d). If Bank of America resigns as Swingline Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swingline Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swingline Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such
resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make ABR Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.05(c). Upon the appointment by the Company of a successor Issuing Bank or Swingline
Lender hereunder (which successor shall in all cases be a Lender other than a Defaulting Lender), (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank or Swingline
Lender, as applicable, (ii) the retiring Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (iii) the successor Issuing Bank shall
issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to Bank of America to effectively assume the obligations of Bank of America with respect to
such Letters of Credit.

(j) Each Lender and each Issuing Bank expressly acknowledges that none of
the Administrative Agent or any Joint Bookrunner has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent or any Joint Bookrunner hereafter taken, including any consent to, and acceptance of any assignment or review
of the affairs of the Borrower or of any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent or any Joint Bookrunner to any Lender or any Issuing Bank as to any matter, including whether the
Administrative Agent or any Joint Bookrunner has disclosed material information in their (or their Related Parties’) possession. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank represents to the Administrative Agent and each Joint Bookrunner that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Joint Bookrunner, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of,
appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and their Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory laws relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent, any Joint Bookrunner, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and
decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself
as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank represents and warrants that (i) the Loan Documents set forth the terms of a commercial
lending facility and (ii) it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary course and is entering into this Agreement as a Lender or Issuing Bank for the purpose of making, acquiring or holding commercial loans and
providing other facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender or Issuing Bank, and not for the purpose of purchasing, acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument, and each Lender and each Issuing Bank agrees not to
assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank represents and warrants that it is sophisticated with respect to decisions to make, acquire and/or hold commercial loans and to provide other facilities set forth
herein, as may be applicable to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, and either it, or the Person exercising discretion in making its decision to make, acquire and/or hold such commercial loans or to provide such other facilities, is experienced in
making, acquiring or holding such commercial loans or providing such other facilities. (k) None of the Lenders or their
Affiliates, if any, identified in this Agreement as a Joint Bookrunner, Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this
Agreement other than, in the case of Lenders, those applicable to all Lenders as such (or applicable to Lenders of the same Class of Loans). Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Joint Bookrunners or such Lenders shall have or be deemed
to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to the relevant Lenders and their Affiliates in their respective capacities as Joint Bookrunners, Syndication Agent or Co-Documentation Agents, as applicable, as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in the preceding paragraph. 
   82
(l) The Lenders are not partners or co-venturers, and no Lender shall be
liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth herein in case of the Administrative Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender. The Administrative Agent shall have the exclusive right on behalf of the Lenders to enforce
the payment of the principal of and interest on any Loan after the date such principal or interest has become due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 
 (m) In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or LC Exposure shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have
made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, LC
Exposure and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative
Agent under Sections 2.12 and 9.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and (ii) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee,
trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and each Issuing Bank to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent
shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its
agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.12 and 9.03. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender
or any Issuing Bank any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or any Issuing Bank to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or
any Issuing Bank in any such proceeding. SECTION 8.02 Posting of Communications . 
 (a) The Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make any Communications available to
the Lenders and the Issuing Banks by posting the Communications on the Platform. (b) Although the Platform and its primary
web portal are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies implemented or modified by the Administrative Agent from time to time (including, as of the Effective Date, a user ID/password authorization system) and the Platform
is secured through a per-deal authorization method whereby each user may access the Platform only on a deal-by-deal basis, each
of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower acknowledges and agree that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure, that the Administrative Agent is not responsible for approving or vetting the
representatives or contacts of any Lender that are added to the Platform, and that there are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution. Each of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower hereby approves distribution of
the Communications through the Platform and understands and assumes the risks of such distribution. 
   83
(c) THE PLATFORM AND THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND
“AS AVAILABLE”. THE APPLICABLE PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS, OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PLATFORM AND THE
COMMUNICATIONS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM
VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY THE APPLICABLE PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE PLATFORM. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY JOINT BOOKRUNNER, THE SYNDICATION AGENT, ANY
 CO-DOCUMENTATION AGENT OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE RELATED PARTIES (COLLECTIVELY, “ APPLICABLE PARTIES ”) HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE BORROWER, ANY LENDER, ANY ISSUING BANK OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR
ENTITY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF THE BORROWER’S OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT’S
TRANSMISSION OF COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET OR THE PLATFORM EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO ACTUAL OR DIRECT DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY FINAL AND NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT TO HAVE RESULTED FROM THE WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF ANY APPLICABLE PARTY; PROVIDED THAT ANY COMMUNICATION OR ANY OTHER DISSEMINATION OR DISCLOSURE OF ANY INFORMATION (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 9.12) TO ANY LENDERS, PROSPECTIVE LENDERS, PARTICIPANTS OR PROSPECTIVE
PARTICIPANTS OR, TO THE EXTENT SUCH DISCLOSURE IS OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY SECTION 9.12, TO ANY OTHER PERSON THROUGH THE PLATFORM SHALL BE MADE SUBJECT TO THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE BY SUCH PERSON THAT SUCH COMMUNICATION IS BEING DISSEMINATED
OR DISCLOSED ON A CONFIDENTIAL BASIS (ON TERMS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 9.12 OR OTHERWISE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COMPANY), WHICH SHALL IN ANY EVENT REQUIRE “CLICK THROUGH” OR OTHER
AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONS ON THE PART OF THE RECIPIENT TO ACCESS SUCH COMMUNICATION. (d) Each Lender and each Issuing Bank
agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that Communications have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender and
each Issuing Bank agrees (i) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing (which could be in the form of electronic communication) from time to time of such Lender’s or such Issuing Bank’s (as applicable) email address to which the
foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and (ii) that the foregoing notice may be sent to such email address. 
 (e) Each of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but (except as may be
required by applicable law) shall not be obligated to, store the Communications on the Platform in accordance with the Administrative Agent’s generally applicable document retention procedures and policies. 
 (f) Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to give any notice or
other communication pursuant to any Loan Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document. 
   84
SECTION 8.03 Certain ERISA Matters . 
 (a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and
(y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the
Borrower, that at least one of the following is and will be true: (i) such Lender is not using “plan assets”
(within the meaning of the Plan Asset Regulations) of one or more Benefit Plans with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments or this
Agreement, (ii) the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE 8414 (a class exemption for certain
transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers), PTE 95-60 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank
collective investment funds) or PTE 96-23 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect to such
Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, 
 (iii) (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning
of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans, the Letters of
Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-14 and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, or 
 (iv) such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Administrative Agent, in its sole
discretion, and such Lender. (b) In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause 
(i) in the immediately preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has not provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with sub-clause 
(iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to
the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower, that the Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary with respect to the
assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise
of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto). 
   85
SECTION 8.04 Recovery of Erroneous Payments . Without limitation of any other
provision in this Agreement, if at any time the Administrative Agent makes a payment hereunder in error to any Credit Party, whether or not in respect of an Obligation due and owing by the Borrower at such time, where such payment is a Rescindable
Amount, then in any such event, each Credit Party receiving a Rescindable Amount severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount received by such Credit Party in immediately available funds in the
currency so received, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such Rescindable Amount is received by it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Overnight Bank Funding Rate and a
rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. Each Credit Party irrevocably waives any and all defenses, including any “discharge for value” (under which a creditor might
otherwise claim a right to retain funds mistakenly paid by a third party in respect of a debt owed by another) or similar defense to its obligation to return any Rescindable Amount. The Administrative Agent shall inform each Credit Party promptly
upon determining that any payment made to such Credit Party comprised, in whole or in part, a Rescindable Amount. ARTICLE IX

Notices sent by hand or overnight courier service, or mailed by certified or registered
mail, shall be deemed to have been given when received; notices sent by facsimile shall be deemed to have been given when sent (except that, if not given during normal business hours for the recipient, shall be deemed to have been given at the

 (b) Notices and other communications to the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereunder may be delivered or furnished by using
Platforms pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices pursuant to Article II unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Lender. The
Administrative Agent or the Company may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be
limited to particular notices or communications. (c) Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes,
(i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the sender’s receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the “return
receipt requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon
the deemed receipt by the intended recipient, at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i), of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address
therefor; provided that, for both clauses (i) and (ii) above, if such notice, email or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at
the opening of business on the next business day for the recipient. (d) Any party hereto may change its address or
telecopy number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto (or, in the case of a Lender, by notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent). 
 (e) Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) (a “ Notice ”) specifying that any
Communications have been posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of such information, documents or other materials to such Lender for purposes of this Agreement. Each Lender agrees (i) to notify the Administrative Agent in
writing of such Lender’s e-mail address to which a Notice may be sent by electronic transmission (including by electronic communication) on or before the date such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement
(and from time to time thereafter to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record an effective e-mail address for such Lender) and (ii) that any Notice may be sent to such e-mail address. (f) The Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders shall be
entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic or electronic notices, Borrowing Request, Letter of Credit applications and notice of loan prepayment) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices
were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The
Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank, each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by
or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording. 
   88
SECTION 9.02 Waivers; Amendments . 
 (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder
or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and
acknowledged by the Administrative Agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a
Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. 
 (b) Except as provided in Section 2.20 with respect to an Incremental Facility Amendment, in Section 2.21 with
respect to an extension of the Maturity Date or as provided in Section 2.14(c), neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the
Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the amount of or extend the Commitment of any Lender without
the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected
thereby ( provided that (x) any amendment or modification of the financial covenants in this Agreement (or defined terms used in the financial covenants in this Agreement) or pursuant to the terms of Section 2.14(c) shall not
constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for purposes of this clause (ii) even if the effect of such amendment or modification would be to reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or any LC Disbursement or to reduce any fee payable
hereunder and (y) only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to amend the provisions of Section 2.13(c) or to waive any obligation of the Borrower to pay interest or any other amount at the interest rate prescribed in such
Section), (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the
scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby (other than (x) any reduction of the amount of, or any extension of the payment date for, the mandatory prepayments required
under Section 2.11, in each case which shall only require the approval of the Required Lenders and (y) with respect to the matters set forth in clauses (ii)(x) and (ii)(y) above), (iv) change Section 2.09(c) or Section 2.18(b) or
(c) in a manner that would alter the ratable reduction of Commitments or the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change the payment waterfall provisions of Section 2.24(b)
without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of “Required Lenders” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive,
amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (it being understood that, solely with the consent of the parties prescribed by Section 2.20 to be parties
to an Incremental Facility Amendment, Incremental Term Loans may be included in the determination of Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Commitments and the Revolving Loans are included on the Effective Date) or
(vii) subordinate, or have the effect of subordinating, the Obligations to 
   89
any other Indebtedness or other obligations without the written consent of each Lender; provided , further , that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights
or duties of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be (it being understood that any
change to Section 2.24 shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification of this Agreement
shall be required of any Defaulting Lender, except with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso of this paragraph and then only in the event such Defaulting Lender
shall be directly affected by such amendment, waiver or other modification. (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Agreement and any other Loan Document may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (x) to add one or more credit facilities (in addition to the Incremental
Term Loans pursuant to an Incremental Facility Amendment) to this Agreement and to permit extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Revolving Loans, Incremental Term Loans and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (y) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the
Required Lenders and Lenders (it being understood and agreed that any such amendment (i) in connection with new or increases to the Commitments and/or Incremental Term Loans in accordance with Section 2.20 or (ii) in connection with
any extension in accordance with Section 2.21 shall, in any such case, require solely only the consent of the parties prescribed by such Section and shall not require the consent of the Required Lenders). 
 (d) If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of “each Lender” or
“each Lender directly affected thereby,” the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is necessary but not obtained being referred to herein as a
“ Non-Consenting Lender ”), then the Company may elect to replace a Non-Consenting Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement; provided that,
concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Company and the Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to the Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Non-Consenting 
Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of clause (b) of Section 9.04, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Non-Consenting Lender in same day funds on the
day of such replacement (A) the outstanding principal amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Non-Consenting 
Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including payments due to such Non-Consenting Lender under Sections 2.15 and 2.17, and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the
payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 2.16 had the Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement
Lender. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the assignee (or, to the extent applicable, an
agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants), and the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order
for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound by the terms thereof; provided that, following the 
   90
effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the
applicable Lender; provided , further , that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to SOFR or Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent will have the
right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of
any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the
Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. SECTION 9.03 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver .

Document, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses
(subject to the foregoing limitations with respect to legal fees and expenses) incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by any Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the

any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation, arbitration or proceeding relating to any of the
foregoing, whether or not such claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding is brought by the Company or its or their respective equity holders, Affiliates, creditors or any other third Person and whether based on contract, tort or any other
theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (A) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnitee or any of its Controlled Related Parties, (B) a breach in bad faith by such
Indemnitee of any of its material obligations under the applicable Loan Documents pursuant to a claim or counterclaim initiated by the Borrower or (C) any dispute solely among Indemnitees (not arising as a result of any act or omission by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) other than claims against any Credit Party in its capacity as, or in fulfilling its role as, the Administrative Agent, an Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender, a Joint Bookrunner, agent or any similar
role under or in connection with this Agreement. As used in this Section 9.03, a “ Controlled Related Party ” of an Indemnitee means (1) any Controlling Person or Controlled Affiliate of such Indemnitee, (2) the
respective directors, officers, or employees of such Indemnitee or any of its Controlling Persons or Controlled Affiliates and (3) the respective agents or representatives of such Indemnitee or any of its Controlling Persons or Controlled
Affiliates, in the case of this clause (3), acting on behalf of or at the instructions of such Indemnitee, Controlling Person or such Controlled Affiliate; provided that each reference to a Controlling Person, Controlled Affiliate, director,
officer or employee in this sentence pertains to a Controlling Person, Controlled Affiliate, director, officer or employee involved in the structuring, arrangement, negotiation or syndication of the credit facility evidenced by this Agreement. This
Section 9.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims or damages arising from any non-Tax claim. 
   92
(c) To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required to be
paid by it to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case
may be, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount (it being understood that the Company’s failure to pay any such amount
shall not relieve the Company of any default in the payment thereof); provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. (d) To the extent permitted by
applicable law, and subject to the proviso set forth in Section 8.02(c), the Borrower shall not assert, and the Borrower hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other
materials obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet) other than damages that are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any of its Controlled Related Parties. To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Indemnitee shall assert against the Borrower or its Related Parties and the Borrower
shall not assert against any Indemnitee, and each Indemnitee and the Borrower hereby waives, any claim on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof; provided that
nothing contained in this sentence shall limit the Company’s indemnity obligations to the extent set forth in Section 9.03(b). 
 (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than fifteen (15) days after written demand therefor.
 SECTION 9.04 Successors and Assigns . 
 (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby
(including any Affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 
 (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more Persons (other than an Ineligible
Institution) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) of: 
   93
(A) the Company ( provided that the Company shall be deemed to have
consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received written notice thereof); provided , further , that no consent of the
Company shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h), (i) or (j) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee; 
 (B) the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment
to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; (C) each Issuing Bank; and 
 (D) the Swingline Lender. 
 (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions: 
 (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, or an assignment of the
entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with
respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 and increments of $1,000,000 in excess thereof unless each of the Company and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent; provided that no
such consent of the Company shall be required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h), (i) or (j) of Article VII has occurred and is continuing; 
 (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights
and obligations under this Agreement; provided that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or
Loans; (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent (x) an Assignment
and Assumption or (y) to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and the parties to the Assignment and Assumption are participants,
together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, such fee to be paid by either the assigning Lender or the assignee Lender or shared between such Lenders; and 
 (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in
which the assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public information about the Company and its Related Parties and their
respective securities) will be made available and who may receive such information in accordance with the assignee’s compliance procedures and applicable laws, including federal and state securities laws. 
   94
(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations (including the obligation to timely deliver the documentation described in Section 2.17(f)) of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender
shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03); provided that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting
Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply
with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section. 
 (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the
Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount (and stated interest)
of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “ Register ”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive (absent manifest error), and the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall
be available for inspection by the Company, any Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. 
 (v) Upon its receipt of (x) a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee or
(y) to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and the parties to the Assignment and Assumption are participants, the
assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment
required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee
shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), Section 2.06(d), Section 2.06(e), Section 2.07(b), Section 2.18(d) or Section 9.03(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no
obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for
purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph. 
   95
(c) Any Lender may, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to any Person other than an Ineligible Institution (a “ Participant ”), in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification
or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations
therein, including the requirements under Section 2.17(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.17(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.18 and 2.19 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of
this Section, and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such
entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans
or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “ Participant Register ”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any
Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish
that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) or Proposed Section 1.163-5(b) of the United
States Treasury Regulations (or any amended or successor version). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the
owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a
Participant Register. (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its
rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central banking authority having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall not
apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto. 
   96
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any
time any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to clause (b) above, such Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender may, (i) upon 30 days’ notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the
Lenders, resign as an Issuing Bank and/or (ii) upon 30 days’ notice to the Borrower, resign as the Swingline Lender. In the event of any such resignation as an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint
from among the Lenders a successor Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender hereunder; provided that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as an
Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be. If the applicable Issuing Bank resigns as an Issuing Bank, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an Issuing Bank hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit
issued by it and outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an Issuing Bank and all Obligations with respect to such LC Exposure (including the right to require the Lenders to make ABR Loans or fund risk participations in
Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.06(d)). If the Swingline Lender resigns as Swingline Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swingline Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swingline Loans made by it and outstanding as
of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make ABR Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.05(c). Upon the appointment of a successor Issuing Bank
and/or Swingline Lender, (x) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, and (y) the successor Issuing Bank
shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the applicable retiring Issuing Bank to effectively assume the obligations of the
applicable retiring Issuing Bank with respect to such Letters of Credit. SECTION 9.05 Survival . All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Borrower in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon
by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and
notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding (unless such Letter of
Credit has been cash collateralized or backstopped pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.22, 9.03
and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the
termination of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof. SECTION 9.06 Counterparts; Integration;
Effectiveness; Electronic Execution . (a) This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties
hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees
payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.
Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear
the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this
Agreement by telecopy, e-mailed .pdf or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of the actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement. 
   97
(b) This Agreement, any other Loan Document and any document, amendment,
approval, consent, information, notice, certificate, request, statement, disclosure or authorization related to this Agreement (each, a “ Related Communication ”), including Related Communications required to be in writing, may be in
the form of an Electronic Record and may be executed using Electronic Signatures. The Company and each Credit Party agrees that any Electronic Signature on or associated with any Related Communication shall be valid and binding on such Person to the
same extent as a manual, original signature, and that any Related Communication entered into by Electronic Signature, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Person enforceable against such Person in accordance with the terms
thereof to the same extent as if a manually executed original signature was delivered. Any Related Communication may be executed in as many counterparts as necessary or convenient, including both paper and electronic counterparts, but all such
counterparts are one and the same Related Communication. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of any Related Communication by facsimile or other electronic messaging means (e.g. “.pdf” or “.tif”) shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of such Related Communication. For the avoidance of doubt, the authorization under this Section 9.06(b) may include use or acceptance of a manually signed paper Related Communication
which has been converted into electronic form (such as scanned into .pdf), or an electronically signed Related Communication converted into another format, for transmission, delivery and/or retention. Each Credit Party may, at its option, create one
or more copies of any Related Communication in the form of an imaged Electronic Record (each, an “ Electronic Copy ”), which shall be deemed created in the ordinary course of such Person’s business, and destroy the original paper
document. All Related Communications in the form of an Electronic Record, including an Electronic Copy, shall be considered an original for all purposes, and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Credit Party is under any obligation to accept an Electronic Signature in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by such Person pursuant to procedures approved by it;
 provided that without limiting the foregoing, (i) to the extent such Credit Party has agreed to accept such Electronic Signature, each of the Credit Parties shall be entitled to rely on any such Electronic Signature purportedly given by
or on behalf of the Company and/or any Credit Party without further verification and regardless of the appearance or form of such Electronic Signature, and (ii) upon the request of any Credit Party, any Related Communication executed using an
Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by a manually executed counterpart. No Credit Party shall be responsible
for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other Related Communication (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with such Credit
Party’s reliance on any Electronic Signature transmitted by telecopy, emailed .pdf or any other electronic means). Each Credit Party shall be entitled to rely on, and shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document by acting upon, any Related Communication or any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent or otherwise authenticated (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set
forth in the Loan Documents for being the maker thereof). 
   98
Each of Company and each Credit Party hereby waives (A) any argument,
defense or right to contest the legal effect, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other Loan Document based solely on the lack of paper original copies of this Agreement or such other Loan Document, and (b) any claim against any
Credit Party for any liabilities arising solely from any Credit Party’s reliance on or use of Electronic Signatures, including any liabilities arising as a result of the failure of the Company to use any available security measures in
connection with the execution, delivery or transmission of any Electronic Signature. SECTION 9.07 Severability . Any provision of
any Loan Document held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. 
 SECTION 9.08 Right of Setoff . Subject to Section 2.24(b) and any limitations expressly agreed to by any Lender or its Affiliate,
as applicable, pursuant to any Banking Services Agreement or Swap Agreement to which such Lender or Affiliate is a party, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Loans have been accelerated pursuant to Article VII, each
Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held
and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all of the Obligations then due and owing by the Borrower held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not
such Lender shall have made any demand under the Loan Documents. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. Each Lender and each Issuing
Bank agrees to notify the Company and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
 SECTION 9.09 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process . 
 (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. (b) Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that, notwithstanding the governing law provisions of any applicable Loan Document, any claims brought against the Administrative Agent by any Lender relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document or the consummation
or administration of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York. 
 (c) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan (or if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan), and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions relating hereto or thereto, or for recognition or enforcement of any
judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may (and any such claims, cross-claims or third party claims brought against the Administrative Agent
or any of its Related Parties may only) be heard and determined in such federal (to the extent permitted by law) or New York State court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender
may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. 
   99
(d) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court

and its obligations under this Agreement and any actual or prospective party (or its managers, administrators, trustees, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives) to any swap or derivative or similar
transaction to which the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender is a party and under which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder; (g) on a confidential basis
to (i) any rating agency in connection with rating the Company or its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided for herein, (ii) the provider of any Platform or other electronic delivery service used to deliver Borrower Materials or

the prior written consent of the Company; or (i) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section, (ii) is independently discovered or developed by a party hereto without
utilizing any Information received from the Borrower or violating the terms of this Section, or (iii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower
or any of its Related Parties. For the purposes of this Section, “ Information ” means all information received from or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Related Parties relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or its business
or securities, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its respective Related Parties and

   101
SECTION 9.13 Patriot Act . Each Lender that is subject to the Patriot Act and the
Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Company, which
information includes the name and address of the Company and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Company in accordance with the Act. The Company shall, promptly following a
request by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other information that the Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable “know your customer”
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act. SECTION 9.14 [Reserved] . 
 SECTION 9.15 Interest Rate Limitation . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to
any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the “ Charges ”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “ Maximum Rate ”)
which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect
thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the
interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Overnight Bank Funding Rate to the date
of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender. SECTION 9.16 No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility . In connection with
all aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Company acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates’
understanding, that: (a)(i) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Joint Bookrunners and the Lenders are arm’s-length commercial transactions
between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Joint Bookrunners and the Lenders, on the other hand, (ii) each of the Company has consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to
the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (iii) the Company is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents; (b)(i) the
Administrative Agent, the Joint Bookrunners and each Lender is and has been acting solely as a principal and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or
fiduciary for the Company or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (ii) none of the Administrative Agent, any Joint Bookrunner or any Lender has any obligation to the Company or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents; and (c) the Administrative Agent, the Joint Bookrunners and the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of
transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Company and its Affiliates, and none of the Administrative Agent, any Joint Bookrunners, or any Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Company or any of
its Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, any Joint Bookrunner or any Lender with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or
fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby. SECTION 9.17 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto
acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and
agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: 
   102
(a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the
applicable EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and 
 (b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
 (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; 
 (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected
Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such
liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in
connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any the applicable Resolution Authority. SECTION 9.18
 Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs . To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Swap Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “ QFC Credit
Support ” and each such QFC a “ Supported QFC ”), the parties hereto acknowledge and agree, with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “ U.S. Special Resolution Regimes ”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the
provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States), that in the
event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “ Covered Party ”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support
(and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective
under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a
Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that
may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws
of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered
Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support. [Signature Pages Follow]
