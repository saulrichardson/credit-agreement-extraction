Located Annex I of the Belden amendment inside `data/daily_filings/2023/QTR1/20230105.nc.tar.gz` by extracting the EX-10.1 HTML and scrolling to the definition of "Applicable Rate," which contains the Average Quarterly Availability grid shown above. The clause confirms it is the pricing schedule for both ABR and SOFR loans, and the paragraph immediately after the table states the margin resets each fiscal quarter, defaults to Category 3 whenever Borrowing Base Certificates are late, and stays in Category 1 through the first full quarter after the restatement effective date.

In the Brown-Forman 364-day credit agreement EX-10.1 (same 2023-01-05 tarball), Section 1.01's "Applicable Rate" definition explicitly introduces the Term SOFR margin grid keyed off the Index Debt ratings, so it is the official performance-pricing table. Immediately after the table, the document lists the split-rating mechanics: missing agency ratings default to Category 5, matching ratings govern, the higher rating applies when two ratings differ (unless the lower one is two categories beneath), and any change is effective upon public announcement.

#### 0001104659-23-001503
The Inotiv credit agreement EX-10.1 (also from the 2023-01-05 tarball) contains the Secured Leverage Ratio-based "Applicable Margin" grid in Section 1.01. I navigated to the definition by searching for "Applicable Margin," verified the table lists both Term SOFR and ABR spreads, and noted the proviso that margins only update three Business Days after the agent receives the required financials and automatically step up to the highest tier whenever reporting is delinquent or an Event of Default is outstanding.
