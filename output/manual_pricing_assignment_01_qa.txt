Manual Pricing QA Instructions – Manual Pricing Assignment 01

1. Source Material to Reopen
   - Tarball: data/daily_filings/2023/QTR1/20230103.nc.tar.gz
   - Target accessions: 0001731122-23-000003, 0001193125-23-000804, 0001287032-23-000003

2. Outputs to Verify
   - Markdown: output/manual_pricing_extraction_task01.md
   - Excel: output/manual_pricing_extraction_task01.xlsx

3. QA Procedure
   - Re-extract each accession’s .nc from the tarball and isolate the EX-10 exhibit (same scratch workflow as the extractor used).
   - Search for the cited pricing section heading/table (use the snippets/line refs in the Markdown table) and confirm the table truly matches the captured data.
   - For every row in the Markdown/Excel outputs, check tier label spelling, column names, and % values against the raw table; confirm any bps conversions were done correctly.
   - Verify snippet/context references: ensure the scratch/extracted_ex10 path exists and that the quoted text surrounds the documented values.
   - Re-read the narrative per accession and confirm it accurately describes the table location and any quirks (late-cert penalties, rating adjustments, etc.).
   - If a pricing table was not found, confirm the stated reason (e.g., only lender list) and note whether you agree.

4. Documentation of QA
   - Record findings in a short QA log (OK vs. discrepancies) and flag any corrections needed back to the extraction owner.
   - Include exact citations (path + line/paragraph) for any discrepancies so they can be fixed quickly.
