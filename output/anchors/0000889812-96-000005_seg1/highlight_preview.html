--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 <br>
The objective of the Trust is total return through an investment for<br>
approximately one year in a portfolio consisting of the five lowest dollar price<br>
per share common stocks of the ten common stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial<br>
Average having the highest dividend yields on December 29, 1995. Dow Jones and<br>
Company Inc. has not participated in any way in the creation of the Trust or in<br>
the selection of stocks included in the Trust and has not approved any<br>
information included herein relating thereto. The value of the Units of the<br>
Trust will fluctuate with the value of the portfolio of underlying Securities.<br>
Units of the Trust may be suited for purchase by Individual Retirement Accounts,<br>
Keogh Plans and other tax-deferred retirement plans.<br>
 <br>
Unit Holders may elect, prior to the Termination Date (approximately one year<br>
after the creation of the Trust), one or more of the following options: (1)<br>
receiving their pro rata share of the underlying Securities in kind, (2)<br>
receiving cash upon the liquidation of their pro rata share of the underlying<br>
Securities and (3) investing the amount of cash they would have received upon<br>
the liquidation of their pro rata share of the underlying Securities in units of<br>
a new trust (if one is offered).<br>
 <br>
The minimum purchase is $1,000 except that the minimum purchase in connection<br>
with an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or other tax-deferred retirement<br>
plan is $250.<br>

 This Prospectus does not contain all the information with respect to the<br>
investment company set forth in its registration statement and exhibits relating<br>
thereto which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,<br>
Washington, D.C. under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act<br>
of 1940, and to which reference is hereby made.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 <br>
 The NATIONAL EQUITY TRUST, Low Five Portfolio Series 4 (the &#x27;Trust&#x27;) is<br>
composed of common stock issued by the five companies whose common stocks are<br>
the five lowest dollar price per share common stocks of the ten common stocks in<br>
the Dow Jones Industrial Average having the highest dividend yield on December<br>
29, 1995 (the &#x27;Securities&#x27; or &#x27;Security&#x27; or &#x27;Low Five&#x27;, as the context<br>
requires), and contracts and funds for the purchase thereof and/or cash (or a<br>
letter of credit in lieu of cash) with instructions to the Trustee to purchase<br>
Securities. Subsequent to the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor may, but is not<br>
obligated to, deposit additional Securities, contracts to purchase additional<br>
Securities together with a letter of credit and/or cash (or a letter of credit<br>
in lieu of cash) with instructions to purchase additional Securities maintaining<br>
to the extent practicable the proportionate relationship of the number of shares<br>
of each Security in the portfolio of the Trust (the &#x27;Portfolio&#x27;) immediately<br>
prior to such deposit thereby creating additional Units which Units the Sponsor<br>
intends to offer by means of this Prospectus. (See Part B--&#x27;The Trust.&#x27;)<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 THE OBJECTIVE of the Trust is total return through an investment for<br>
approximately one year in a portfolio of the five lowest dollar price per share<br>
common stocks of the ten common stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average<br>
having the highest dividend yield on December 29, 1995. (See &#x27;Summary of<br>
Essential Information&#x27; for the Termination Date of the Trust.) There can be no<br>
assurance that such objective can be realized. The factors affecting the value<br>
of the Securities are those factors that have an impact upon the value of equity<br>
securities in general and particularly those factors that affect the economic<br>
and financial condition of each issuer of a Security in particular. (Total<br>
return includes (i) the value per Unit of the Securities in the Portfolio of the<br>
Trust at the termination of the Trust less the value per Unit of the Securities<br>
in the Portfolio of the Trust at the commencement of the Trust plus (ii) the<br>
dividends paid on the Securities during the life of the Trust).<br>
 <br>
 DISTRIBUTIONS of dividends received (net of expenses) and return of<br>
capital, if any, by the Trust will be made quarterly on or shortly after the<br>
Quarterly Distribution Date to Unit Holders of record on the Record Date<br>
immediately preceding such Quarterly Distribution Date. (See Part B--&#x27;Rights of<br>
Unit Holders--Distributions.&#x27;) Because the expenses of the Trust may exceed the<br>
dividend income received by the Trust there can be no assurance that there will<br>
be any amounts available for distribution to Unit Holders.<br>
 <br>
 PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE of the Units of the Trust during the initial offering<br>
period is equal to the value of the underlying Securities in the Trust&#x27;s<br>
Portfolio divided by the number of Units outstanding in the Trust, plus the<br>
applicable sales charge. A proportionate share of amounts, if any, in the Income<br>
Account is also added to the Public Offering Price. (See Part B--&#x27;Public<br>
Offering of Units--Public Offering Price.&#x27;) The total sales charge consists of<br>
an Initial Sales Charge and a Deferred Sales Charge, the total of which equals<br>
2.75% of the Public Offering Price or 2.778% of the net asset value of the<br>
Trust. The Initial Sales Charge is computed by deducting the Deferred Sales<br>
Charge ($17.50 per 1,000 Units) from the aggregate sales charge; thus, on the<br>
date of the Summary of Essential Information, the Initial Sales Charge is $10<br>
per 1,000 Units or 1% of the Public Offering Price. The Initial Sales Charge<br>
will vary with changes in the aggregate sales charge and is deducted from the<br>
purchase price of a Unit at the time of purchase and paid to the Sponsor. The<br>
Initial Sales Charge will be reduced on a graduated basis on purchases of<br>
$50,000 or more. The Deferred Sales Charge is paid through reduction of the net<br>
asset value of the Trust by $1.75 per 1,000 Units monthly on each Deferred Sales<br>
Charge Deduction Date commencing on the first Deferred Sales Charge Deduction<br>
Date shown on the Summary of Essential Information. Units purchased pursuant to<br>
the Reinvestment Program are subject only to remaining deductions of the<br>
Deferred Sales Charge (see &#x27;Reinvestment Program&#x27;). If a Unit Holder exchanges,<br>
redeems or sells his Units to the Sponsor prior to the last Deferred Sales<br>
Charge Deduction Date, the Unit Holder is obligated to pay any remaining<br>
Deferred Sales Charge.<br>
 <br>
 SECONDARY MARKET--The Sponsor, although not obligated to do so, presently<br>
intends to maintain a secondary market for the Units in the Trust as more fully<br>
described under Part B--&#x27;Public Offering of Units--Secondary Market.&#x27; If such a<br>
market is not maintained, a Unit Holder will be able to dispose of his Units<br>
only by tendering his Units to the Trustee for redemption. (See Part B--&#x27;Rights<br>
of Unit Holders--Redemption--Computation of Redemption Price per Unit.&#x27;) The<br>
Sponsor&#x27;s Repurchase Price, like the Redemption Price, will reflect the<br>
deduction from the value of the underlying Securities of any unpaid amount of<br>
the Deferred Sales Charge. Investors should note that the Deferred Sales Charge<br>
of $1.75 per 1,000 Units will be deducted from the net asset value on the first<br>
of each month commencing on the first Deferred Sales Charge Deduction Date shown<br>
on the Summary of Essential Information, and to the extent the entire Deferred<br>
Sales Charge has not been so deducted or paid at the time of redemption of the<br>
Units, the remainder will be deducted from the proceeds of redemption or in<br>
calculating an in-kind redemption.<br>
 <br>
 TRUST TERMINATION--The Trust will terminate on the Termination Date set<br>
forth in the Summary of Essential Information, approximately one year after the<br>
Date of Deposit (unless terminated earlier; see part B--&#x27;Amendment and<br>
Termination of the Indenture--Termination&#x27;). A Unit Holder&#x27;s Units will be<br>
redeemed in kind on the Termination Date by distribution of the Unit Holder&#x27;s<br>
pro rata share of the Securities and any cash in the Portfolio of the Trust on<br>
such date to the Distribution Agent who will act as agent for such Unit Holder.<br>
 <br>
 A-1<br>
 <br>
 SECURITIES DISPOSITION OPTIONS--A Unit Holder who so elects by notifying<br>
the Trustee prior to the Termination Date of the Trust will have the Securities<br>
received on the Termination Date disposed of on behalf of such Unit Holder by<br>
The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association), as &#x27;Distribution Agent&#x27; in<br>
accordance with one or more of the following three options as elected by such<br>
Unit Holder:<br>
 <br>
 1. to have such underlying Securities distributed in kind no later<br>
 than the business day next following the Termination Date. Unit Holders<br>
 subsequently selling such distributed Securities will incur brokerage costs<br>
 when disposing of such Securities;<br>
 <br>
 2. to receive the Unit Holder&#x27;s pro rata share of the cash received<br>
 by the Distribution Agent (less expenses) upon the sale by the Distribution<br>
 Agent of the underlying Securities attributable to Unit Holders electing<br>
 this option over a period not to exceed 10 business days immediately<br>
 following the Termination Date. Amounts received by the Distribution Agent<br>
 over such 10 business day period representing the proceeds of the<br>
 underlying Securities sold will be held by The Chase Manhattan Bank<br>
 (National Association) in accounts which are non-interest bearing to Unit<br>
 Holders and which are available for use by The Chase Manhattan Bank<br>
 (National Association) pursuant to normal banking procedures and will be<br>
 distributed to Unit Holders within 5 business days after the settlement of<br>
 the trade for the last Security to be sold; and/or<br>
 <br>
 3. to invest the proceeds from the sale of the underlying Securities<br>
 attributable to Unit Holders electing this option within 30 days of the<br>
 Termination Date, as received by the Distribution Agent upon the sale of<br>
 such underlying Securities over a period not to exceed 10 business days<br>
 immediately following the Termination Date, in units of a subsequent series<br>
 of National Equity Trust as designated by the Sponsor (the &#x27;New Series&#x27;) if<br>
 such New Series is offered at such time. The Units of a New Series will be<br>
 purchased by the Unit Holder upon the settlement of the trade for the last<br>
 Security to be sold. Such purchaser will be entitled to a reduced sales<br>
 load upon the purchase of units of the New Series. It is expected that the<br>
 terms of the New Series will be substantially the same as the terms of the<br>
 Trust described in this Prospectus, and that similar options in a<br>
 subsequent series of the Trust will occur in each New Series of the Trust<br>
 approximately one year after that New Series&#x27; creation. The availability of<br>
 this option does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to purchase<br>
 Units of a New Series or any other security. A Unit Holder&#x27;s election to<br>
 participate in this option will be treated as an indication of interest<br>
 only. At any time prior to the purchase by the Unit Holder of units of a<br>
 New Series, such Unit Holder may change his investment strategy and<br>
 receive, in cash, the proceeds of the sale of the Securities.<br>
 <br>
 Unit Holders who do not elect as set forth above will have their Units<br>
redeemed on the Termination Date and be deemed to have elected to receive the<br>
cash proceeds from the sale of such Unit Holder&#x27;s pro rata share of the<br>
underlying Securities (option 2).<br>
 <br>
 Under each option a Unit Holder will receive the Redemption Price per Unit<br>
(net asset value) determined as of the Evaluation Time on the Termination Date.<br>
The Distribution Agent will sell the underlying Securities in the case of the<br>
second and third option over a period not to exceed 10 business days immediately<br>
following the Termination Date. The proceeds of any such sales will be reduced<br>
by any applicable brokerage commissions. The sale arrangement is one in which<br>
The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association) will be selling the Securities<br>
as agent for the Unit Holder and is separate from the Trust which terminates on<br>
the Termination Date. The proceeds of such sales may be more or less than the<br>
value of the Securities on the Termination Date. The Sponsor, on behalf of the<br>
Distribution Agent if the Sponsor effects such sales, or the Distribution Agent<br>
if the Sponsor does not, will, unless prevented by unusual and unforeseen<br>
circumstances, such as, among other reasons, a suspension in trading of a<br>
Security, the close of a stock exchange, outbreak of hostilities and collapse of<br>
the economy, sell on each business day during the 10 business day period at<br>
least a number of shares of each Security which then remains in the Portfolio<br>
equal to the number of such shares in the Portfolio at the beginning of such day<br>
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is one and the denominator of<br>
which is the number of days remaining in the 10 business day sales period. The<br>
proceeds of sale will not be distributed by the Distribution Agent until the<br>
settlement of the trade upon the sale of the last Security during the 10<br>
business day period.<br>
 <br>
 Depending on the amount of proceeds to be invested in Units of the New<br>
Series and the number of other orders for Units in the New Series, the Sponsor<br>
may purchase a large amount of securities for the New Series in a short period<br>
of time. The Sponsor&#x27;s buying of securities may tend to raise the market prices<br>
of these Securities. The actual market impact of the Sponsor&#x27;s purchases,<br>
however, is currently unpredictable because the actual amount of securities to<br>
be purchased and the supply and price of those securities is unknown. A similar<br>
problem may occur in connection with the sale of Securities during the 10<br>
business day period following the Termination Date; depending on the number of<br>
sales required, the prices of, and demand for Securities, such sales may tend to<br>
depress the market prices and thus reduce the proceeds to be credited to Unit<br>
Holders. The Sponsor believes that the sale of underlying Securities over a 10<br>
business day period as described above is in the best interest of Unit Holders<br>
and may mitigate the negative market price consequences stemming from the<br>
trading of large amounts of Securities. The Sponsor, in implementing such sales<br>
of Securities on behalf of the Distribution Agent, will seek to maximize the<br>
sales proceeds and will act in the best interest of the Unit Holder. The<br>
proceeds of the sale of the Securities will be in an amount equal to amounts<br>
realized upon the sale of the Securities over the 10 business day period. There<br>
can be no assurance, however, that any adverse price consequences of heavy<br>
trading will be mitigated.<br>
 <br>
 RISK FACTORS--Since the Trust Portfolio consists of common stock, an<br>
investment in Units of the Trust should be made with an understanding of the<br>
risks inherent in any investment in common stocks. The risks of investing in<br>
common stock include risks associated with the rights to receive payments from<br>
the issuer which are generally inferior to creditors of, or holders of debt<br>
 <br>
 A-2<br>
 <br>
obligations or preferred stocks issued by, the issuer. Holders of common stock<br>
have a right to receive dividends only when and if, and in the amounts, declared<br>
by the issuer&#x27;s board of directors and to participate in amounts available for<br>
distribution by the issuer only after all other claims on the issuer have been<br>
paid or provided for. By contrast, holders of preferred stocks have the right to<br>
receive dividends at a fixed rate when and as declared by the issuer&#x27;s board of<br>
directors, normally on a cumulative basis. Dividends on cumulative preferred<br>
stock must be paid before any dividends are paid on common stock and any<br>
cumulative preferred stock dividend which has been omitted is added to future<br>
dividends payable to the holders of such cumulative preferred stock. Preferred<br>
stocks are also entitled to rights on liquidation which are senior to those of<br>
common stocks. For these reasons, preferred stocks generally entail less risk<br>
than common stocks. Moreover, common stock does not represent an obligation of<br>
the issuer and therefore does not offer any assurance of income or provide the<br>
degree of protection of capital of debt securities. The issuance of debt<br>
securities or even preferred stock by an issuer will create prior claims for<br>
payment of principal, interest and dividends which could adversely affect the<br>
ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its common<br>
stock or the rights of holders of common stock with respect to assets of the<br>
issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy. Further, unlike debt securities which<br>
typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity (which value will<br>
be subject to market fluctuations prior thereto), common stock has neither a<br>
fixed principal amount nor a maturity and has values which are subject to market<br>
fluctuations for as long as the common stock remains outstanding. The value of<br>
the common stock in the Trust thus may be expected to fluctuate over the life of<br>
the Trust to values higher or lower than those prevailing on the Date of<br>
Deposit. The value of a Unit may be subject to greater volatility than an<br>
investment in a more diversified portfolio since the Trust Portfolio contains<br>
only five stocks.<br>
 <br>
 The value of the Units will fluctuate depending on all the factors that<br>
have an impact on the economy and the equity markets. These factors similarly<br>
impact on the ability of an issuer to pay dividends. The Trust is not a<br>
&#x27;managed&#x27; registered investment company and Securities will not be sold by the<br>
Trustee as a result of ordinary market fluctuations.<br>

 * The Date of Deposit. The Date of Deposit is the date on which the Trust<br>
 Indenture and Agreement was signed and the initial deposit of Securities<br>
 with the Trustee was made.<br>
 ** After deduction of the Deferred Sales Charge then payable (zero on the<br>
 date of this Summary of Essential Information).<br>
 *** The sales charge consists of an Initial Sales Charge and a Deferred Sales<br>
 Charge. The Initial Sales Charge is computed by deducting the Deferred<br>
 Sales Charge ($17.50 per 1,000 Units) from the aggregate sales charge (a<br>
 maximum of 2.75% of the Public Offering Price); thus on the date of this<br>
 Summary of Essential Information, the maximum Initial Sales Charge is $10<br>
 per 1,000 Units or 1% of the Public Offering Price. The Initial Sales<br>
 Charge is deducted from the purchase price at the time of purchase and is<br>
 reduced on a graduated basis on purchases of $50,000 or more (see Part<br>
 B--&#x27;Public Offering of Units--Volume Discount&#x27;). The Deferred Sales<br>
 Charge is paid through reduction of the net asset value of the Trust by<br>
 $1.75 per 1,000 Units on each Deferred Sales Charge Deduction Date. On a<br>
 repurchase or redemption of Units before the last Deferred Sales Charge<br>
 Deduction Date, any remaining Deferred Sales Charge payments will be<br>
 deducted from the proceeds. Units purchased pursuant to the Reinvestment<br>
 Program are subject to that portion of the Deferred Sales Charge remaining<br>
 at the time of reinvestment (see Part B--&#x27;Reinvestment Program&#x27;).<br>
 **** This price is computed as of the Date of Deposit and may vary from such<br>

 deductions for remaining Deferred Sales Charge payments ($17.50 per 1,000<br>
 Units initially). The redemption and repurchase price will be further<br>

 expenses of the Trust. In addition, brokerage fees borne by the Trust in<br>
 connection with the purchase of Securities by the Trustee with cash<br>
 deposited in the Trust are currently estimated at $.87 per 1,000 Units.<br>

 ---- --------<br>
 <br>
An investor would pay the following expenses on a $1,000<br>
 investment, assuming the Trust&#x27;s operating expense ratio of<br>
 0.221% and a 5% annual return on the investment throughout<br>
 the periods................................................ $30 $ 72<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 The Example assumes a redemption and reinvestment of all dividends and<br>
distributions and utilizes a 5% annual rate of return as mandated by Securities<br>
and Exchange Commission regulations applicable to mutual funds. For purposes of<br>
the Example, the Deferred Sales Charge imposed on reinvestment of dividends is<br>
not reflected until the year following payment of the dividend; the cumulative<br>
expenses would be higher if sales charges on reinvested dividends were reflected<br>
in the year of reinvestment. THE EXAMPLE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A<br>
REPRESENTATION OF PAST OR FUTURE EXPENSES OR ANNUAL RATE OF RETURN; THE ACTUAL<br>
EXPENSES AND ANNUAL RATE OF RETURN MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN THOSE ASSUMED FOR<br>
PURPOSES OF THE EXAMPLE.<br>
------------------<br>
 <br>
 (a) The maximum Initial Sales Charge is actually the difference between<br>
2.75% and the Deferred Sales Charge ($17.50 per 1,000 Units) and would exceed 1%<br>
if the Public Offering Price exceeds $1,000 per 1,000 Units.<br>
 <br>
 (b) The actual fee is $1.75 per month per 1,000 Units, irrespective of<br>
purchase or redemption price, deducted in each of the last 10 months of each<br>
one-year Portfolio. If a Holder sells, exchanges or redeems Units before all of<br>
these deductions have been made, the balance of the Deferred Sales Charge will<br>
be deducted from the Unit proceeds. If Unit price exceeds $1 per Unit, the<br>
Deferred Sales Charge will be less than 1.75%; if Unit price is less than $1 per<br>
Unit, the Deferred Sales Charge will exceed 1.75%.<br>
 <br>
 (c) Reinvested dividends will be subject only to the Deferred Sales Charge<br>
remaining at the time of reinvestment (see &#x27;Reinvestment Program&#x27; on page B-7).<br>
 <br>
 (d) Includes all or a portion of the cost of the preparation, printing and<br>
execution of the Indenture, Registration Statement and other documents relating<br>
to the Trust, federal and state registration fees and costs, the initial fees<br>
and expenses of the Trustee, legal and auditing expenses and other out of pocket<br>
expenses.<br>
 <br>
 (e) Although each Trust has a term of only approximately one year and is a<br>
unit investment trust rather than a mutual fund, this information is presented<br>
to permit a comparison of fees and expenses, assuming the principal amount and<br>
distributions are rolled over each year into a New Series subject only to the<br>
Deferred Sales Charge.<br>

 SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRUST<br>
 <br>
 Securities Selection. The Trust Portfolio consists of the five lowest<br>
dollar price per share common stocks of the ten common stocks in the Dow Jones<br>
Industrial Average (&#x27;DJIA&#x27;) having the highest dividend yield as of December 29,<br>
1995. Dow Jones and Company Inc. (&#x27;Dow Jones&#x27;) has not participated in any way<br>
in the creation of the Trust or in the selection of the stocks included in the<br>
Trust and has not approved any of the information herein relating thereto. The<br>
yield for each stock was calculated by the Sponsor by annualizing the last<br>
quarterly ordinary dividend declared and dividing the annualized dividend by the<br>
market value of the stock. Such formula (an objective determination) served as<br>
the basis for the Sponsor&#x27;s selection of the ten stocks in the Dow Jones<br>
Industrial Average having the highest dividend yield (the &#x27;Ten Highest-Yielding<br>
Stocks&#x27;). The five lowest dollar price per share stocks from among the Ten<br>
Highest-Yielding Stocks were then selected (the &#x27;Low Five&#x27;). The Securities were<br>
selected irrespective of any buy or sell recommendation by the Sponsor.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Investors should note that the above criteria were applied to the<br>
Securities selected for inclusion in the Trust Portfolio as of December 29,<br>
1995. Subsequent to such date, the Securities may no longer rank among the five<br>
lowest dollar price per share common stocks of the ten common stocks in the DJIA<br>
having the highest dividend yield, the yields on the Securities in the Portfolio<br>
may change or the Securities may no longer be included in the DJIA. However, the<br>
Sponsor may, on and subsequent to the Date of Deposit, deposit additional<br>
Securities and/or contracts to purchase additional Securities together with a<br>
letter of credit which reflect the Portfolio as of the Date of Deposit, subject<br>
to permitted adjustments, and/or cash (or a letter of credit in lieu of cash)<br>
with instructions to purchase additional Securities and sell such additional<br>
Units created. The original proportionate relationship between the number of<br>
shares of each Security in the Trust will be adjusted to reflect the occurrence<br>
of a stock dividend, a stock split, merger, reorganization or a similar event<br>
which affects the capital structure of the issuer of a Security in the Trust but<br>
which does not affect the Trust&#x27;s percentage ownership of the common stock<br>
equity of such issuer at the time of such event and adjust the proportionate<br>
relationship accordingly to all future subsequent deposits. If the Trust<br>
receives the securities of another issuer as the result of a merger or<br>
reorganization of, or a spin-off, or split-up by the issuer of a Security<br>
included in the original Portfolio, the Trust may under certain circumstances<br>
hold those securities as if they were one of the Securities initially deposited<br>
and adjust the proportionate relationship accordingly for all future subsequent<br>
deposits. The sale of additional Units and the sale of Units in the secondary<br>
market may continue even though the Securities would no longer be chosen for<br>
deposit into the Trust if the selection process were to be made at such later<br>
time.<br>

1, 1928. Taking into account a number of names changes, 9 of the original<br>
companies are still in the DJIA today. For two periods of 17 consecutive years<br>

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is comprised of 30 common stocks chosen by<br>
the editors of The Wall Street Journal, published by Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.,<br>
as representative of the broad market and of American industry. The companies<br>
are major factors in their industries and their stocks are widely held by<br>
individuals and institutional investors.<br>
 <br>
 A-6<br>
 <br>
 Changes in the components are made entirely by the editors of The Wall<br>
Street Journal without consultation with the companies, the Sponsor, the stock<br>
exchange or any official agency. For the sake of continuity, such changes are<br>
made rarely. Most substitutions have been the result of mergers, but from time<br>
to time changes may be made to achieve a better representation. Notwithstanding<br>
the foregoing, the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average may be changed<br>
by Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. at any time for any reason.<br>
 <br>
 The following table shows the actual performance of the Dow Jones<br>
Industrial Average, the Ten Highest-Yielding Stocks and the Low Five in each of<br>
the past twenty years as of the date indicated for each of such years. Such<br>
annual returns do not take into account commissions, sales charges, expenses or<br>
taxes. As demonstrated by the table, the Low Five outperformed both the Ten<br>
Highest-Yielding Stocks and the DJIA in most of the 20 years.<br>

(1) Total Return represents the sum of the percentage change in market value of<br>
 each group of stocks between the first trading day of a period and the last<br>
 trading day of a period and the total dividends paid on each group of stocks<br>
 during the period divided by the opening market value of each group of<br>

 The total return figures shown above are not guarantees of future<br>
performance and should not be used as a predictor of returns to be expected in<br>

charges, commissions, expenses or taxes. As indicated in the above table, the<br>
Low Five underperformed the Ten Highest-Yielding Stocks and the DJIA in certain<br>

 <br>
 <br>
 The chart below represents past performance of the DJIA, the Ten<br>
Highest-Yielding Stocks and the Low Five (but not the Trust) and should not be<br>
considered indicative of future results. From January 1976 through December 1995<br>
the average annual total return for the DJIA, the Ten Highest-Yielding Stocks<br>
and Low Five was 13.99%, 17.93% and 20.85%, respectively. The chart reflects a<br>
hypothetical assumption that $10,000 was invested on January 1, 1976 and the<br>
investment strategy followed for 20 years. The chart assumes that all dividends<br>
during a year are reinvested at the end of that year and does not reflect sales<br>
charges, commissions, expenses or taxes. There can be no assurance that the<br>
Trust will outperform the DJIA or the Ten Highest-Yielding Stocks over its<br>
approximately one-year life or over consecutive rollover periods, if available.<br>

 Past performance of any series may not be indicative of results of future<br>
series. Trust performance may be compared to the performance on the same basis<br>
of the DJIA, the S&amp;P 500 Composite Price Stock Index, the Hang Seng Index, the<br>
Financial Times Industrial Ordinary Share Index and the ten highest yielding<br>
stocks in each of the Hang Seng Index and Financial Times Industrial Ordinary<br>
Share Index, or performance data from publications such as Morningstar<br>
Publications, Inc. This performance may also be compared for various periods<br>
with an investment in short-term U.S. Treasury securities; however, the investor<br>
should bear in mind that Treasury securities are fixed income obligations,<br>
having the highest credit characteristics, while equity securities involve<br>
greater risk because they have no maturities, and income thereon is subject to<br>
the financial condition of, and declaration by, the issuers.<br>

 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS&#x27; REPORT<br>
 <br>
TO THE UNIT HOLDERS, SPONSOR AND TRUSTEE<br>
OF THE NATIONAL EQUITY TRUST LOW FIVE PORTFOLIO SERIES 4<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 We have audited the Statement of Financial Condition and Schedule of<br>
Portfolio Securities of the National Equity Trust Low Five Portfolio Series 4 as<br>
of January 2, 1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of the<br>
Trustee and Sponsor (see note (e) to the statement of financial condition). Our<br>
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on<br>
our audit.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing<br>
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain<br>
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material<br>
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting<br>
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included<br>
confirmation of the irrevocable letter of credit for the purchase of securities,<br>
as shown in the Statement of Financial Condition and Schedule of Portfolio<br>
Securities as of January 2, 1996, by correspondence with The Chase Manhattan<br>
Bank, N.A., the Trustee. An audit also includes assessing the accounting<br>
principles used and significant estimates made by the Trustee, as well as<br>
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our<br>
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,<br>
in all material respects, the financial position of the National Equity Trust<br>
Low Five Portfolio Series 4 as of January 2, 1996, in conformity with generally<br>
accepted accounting principles.<br>

 (a) The aggregate value of the Securities represented by Contracts to<br>
Purchase listed under &#x27;Schedule of Portfolio Securities&#x27; included herein and<br>
their cost to the Trust are the same. An irrevocable letter of credit drawn on<br>
Mellon Bank, N.A. in the amount of $25 million has been deposited with the<br>
Trustee for the purchase of Securities pursuant to contracts to purchase such<br>
Securities.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 (b) Represents the aggregate amount of mandatory distributions of $1.75 per<br>
1,000 Units per month payable on the 1st day of each month from April 1996<br>
through January 1997. Distributions will be made to an account maintained by the<br>
Trustee from which the Holders&#x27; Deferred Sales Charge obligation to the Sponsor<br>
will be satisfied. If Units are redeemed prior to January 1997, the remaining<br>
portion of the distribution applicable to such Units will be transferred to such<br>
account on the redemption date.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 (c) The aggregate Public Offering Price is computed on the basis set forth<br>
under &#x27;Public Offering of Units--Public Offering Price.&#x27;<br>
 <br>
 (d) The aggregate maximum sales charge of 2.75% of the Public Offering<br>
Price per Unit is computed on the basis set forth under &#x27;Public Offering of<br>
Units--Public Offering Price.&#x27;<br>
 <br>
 (e) The Trustee has custody of and responsibility for all accounting and<br>
financial books, records, financial statements and related data of the Trust and<br>
is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls<br>
directly related to, and designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the<br>
integrity and reliability of, financial reporting of the Trust. The Trustee is<br>
also responsible for all estimates and accruals reflected in the Trust&#x27;s<br>
financial statements. The Trustee determines the price for each underlying<br>
Security included in the Trust&#x27;s Schedule of Portfolio Securities on the basis<br>
set forth in &#x27;Public Offering of Units--Public Offering Price.&#x27; Under the<br>
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#x27;Act&#x27;), the Sponsor is deemed to be an<br>
issuer of the Trust&#x27;s Units. As such, the Sponsor has the responsibility of an<br>
issuer under the Act with respect to financial statements of the Trust included<br>
in the Registration Statement under the Act and amendments thereto.<br>
 <br>
 (f) Organizational costs borne by the Trust have been deferred and will be<br>
amortized over the life of the Trust. Organizational costs have been estimated<br>
based on a Trust with projected total assets of $50 million. To the extent the<br>
assets of the Trust are fewer or greater, the estimate may vary.<br>

 NATIONAL EQUITY TRUST<br>
 LOW FIVE PORTFOLIO SERIES 4<br>
 <br>
 THE TRUST<br>
 <br>
 National Equity Trust, Low Five Portfolio Series 4 (the &#x27;Trust&#x27;) is one of<br>
a series of similar but separate unit investment trusts created by the Sponsor.<br>
The Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a<br>
Trust Indenture and Agreement and a related Reference Trust Agreement dated the<br>
Date of Deposit (collectively, the &#x27;Indenture&#x27;),* between Prudential Securities<br>
Incorporated (the &#x27;Sponsor&#x27;) and The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association)<br>
(the &#x27;Trustee&#x27;). On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee<br>
common stock issued by the five companies whose common stocks are the five<br>
lowest dollar price per share common stocks of the ten common stocks in the Dow<br>
Jones Industrial Average having the highest dividend yield on the date set forth<br>
on page A-1 (collectively, the &#x27;Securities&#x27; or, singularly, the &#x27;Security,&#x27; as<br>
the context requires) and/or contracts and funds (represented by irrevocable<br>
letter(s) of credit issued by major commercial bank(s)) for the purchase of such<br>
equity securities at prices which reflect the value of the Securities as of the<br>
close of the market as of the Date of Deposit and/or cash (or a letter of credit<br>
in lieu of cash) with instructions to the Trustee to purchase such Securities<br>
(see Schedule of Portfolio Securities). The Trustee then immediately delivered<br>
to the Sponsor the units (the &#x27;Units&#x27;) comprising the entire ownership of the<br>
Trust as of the Date of Deposit which Units the Sponsor, through this<br>
Prospectus, is offering for sale to the public. Each such Unit represented on<br>
the initial Date of Deposit an identical number and type of shares in identical<br>
issuers.<br>
 <br>
 The objective of the Trust is total return through an investment for<br>
approximately one year in a portfolio of the five lowest dollar price per share<br>
common stocks of the ten common stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average<br>
having the highest dividend yield as of a date on or shortly before the Date of<br>
Deposit (the &#x27;Low Five&#x27;). There can be no assurance that such objective can be<br>
realized. The factors affecting the value of the Securities are those factors<br>
that have an impact upon the value of equity securities in general and those<br>
factors that affect the economic and financial condition of each issuer of a<br>
Security in particular.<br>
 <br>
 Subsequent to the initial deposit of Securities on the Date of Deposit, the<br>
Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, deposit from time to time additional<br>
Securities (including contracts together with an irrevocable letter of credit<br>
for the purchase thereof) and/or cash (or a letter of credit in lieu of cash)<br>
with instructions to the Trustee to purchase additional Securities in the Trust,<br>
to receive in exchange therefor additional Units, and to offer such Units to the<br>
public by means of this Prospectus. Any such additional deposits during the 90<br>
day period subsequent to the Date of Deposit will be in amounts which maintain,<br>
to the extent practicable, the original proportionate relationship between the<br>
number of shares of each Security in the Portfolio of the Trust. It may not be<br>
possible to maintain the exact original proportionate relationship because of,<br>
among other reasons, purchase requirements, price changes or unavailability of<br>
Securities. In connection with the deposit by the Sponsor of cash (or a letter<br>
of credit in lieu of cash) with instructions to purchase additional Securities<br>
in order to create Additional Units, to the extent that the price of a Security<br>
fluctuates between the time the cash is deposited and the time the cash is used<br>
to purchase the Security, Units may represent more or less of that Security and<br>
more or less of other Securities in the Portfolio of the Trust. In addition, the<br>
brokerage fees incurred in purchasing Securities with such deposited cash will<br>
be borne by the Trust. Any Unit Holder who purchased Units prior to the purchase<br>
of Securities with such deposited cash would experience dilution as a result of<br>
any such brokerage fees. Any cash deposited with instruction to purchase<br>
Securities not used to purchase Securities and any interest not used to pay<br>
Trust expenses will be distributed to Unit Holders on the earlier of the first<br>
Distribution Date or 90 days after the Date of Deposit. Additional Units may be<br>
continuously offered for sale to the public by means of this Prospectus.<br>
Subsequent to the 90 day period following the Date of Deposit any deposit of<br>
additional Securities and cash must exactly replicate the Portfolio immediately<br>
prior to such deposit. The Sponsor may acquire large volumes of additional<br>
Securities for deposit into the Trust over a short period of time. Such<br>
acquisitions may tend to raise the market prices of these Securities. The<br>
Sponsor cannot currently predict the actual market impact of the Sponsor&#x27;s<br>
purchases of additional Securities, because the actual volume of Securities to<br>
be purchased and the supply and price of such Securities is not known. As<br>
additional Units are issued by the Trust as a result of the deposit of<br>
additional Securities by the Sponsor, the aggregate value of the Securities in<br>
the Trust will be increased and the fractional undivided interest in the Trust<br>
represented by each Unit will be decreased.<br>
 <br>
 The Sponsor may deposit additional Securities and may continue to sell<br>
Units of the Trust even though one or more of the Securities no longer remains<br>
among the Low Five on the date of deposit of the additional Securities.<br>
 <br>
------------------<br>
* Reference is hereby made to said Indenture and any statements contained herein<br>
 are qualified in their entirety by the provisions of said Indenture.<br>
 <br>
 B-1<br>
 <br>
 Notwithstanding the availability of the above-mentioned irrevocable<br>
letter(s) of credit, it is expected that the Sponsor will pay for the Securities<br>
as the contracts for their purchase become due. A substantial portion of such<br>
contracts have not become due by the date of this Prospectus. To the extent<br>
Units are sold prior to the settlement of such contracts, the Sponsor will<br>
receive the purchase price of such Units prior to the time at which it pays for<br>
Securities pursuant to such contracts and have the use of such funds during this<br>
period.<br>
 <br>
 Units will be sold to investors at the Public Offering Price next computed<br>
after receipt of the investor&#x27;s order to purchase Units, if Units are available<br>
to fill orders on the day that that price is set. If Units are not available or<br>
are insufficient to fill the order, the investor&#x27;s order will be rejected by the<br>
Sponsor. The number of Units available may be insufficient to meet demand<br>
because of the Sponsor&#x27;s inability to or decision not to purchase and deposit<br>
underlying Securities in amounts sufficient to maintain the proportionate<br>
numbers of shares of each Security as required to create additional Units. The<br>
Sponsor may, if unable to accept orders on any given day, offer to execute the<br>
order as soon as sufficient Units can be created. An investor who agrees to this<br>
will be deemed to place a new order for that number of Units each day until that<br>
order is accepted. The investor&#x27;s order will then be executed, when Units are<br>
available, at the Public Offering Price next calculated after such continuing<br>
order is accepted. The investor will, of course, be able to revoke his purchase<br>
offer at any time prior to acceptance by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will execute<br>
orders to purchase in the order it determines that they are received, i.e.,<br>
orders received first will be filled first, except that indications of interest<br>
prior to the effectiveness of the registration of the offering of Trust Units<br>
which become orders upon effectiveness will be accepted according to the order<br>
in which the indications of interest were received.<br>
 <br>
 The holders of Units (the &#x27;Unit Holders&#x27; or &#x27;Unit Holder,&#x27; as the context<br>
requires) will have the right to have their Units redeemed at a price based on<br>
the net asset value (the &#x27;Redemption Price&#x27;) if they cannot be sold in the<br>
secondary market which the Sponsor, although not obligated to do so, proposes to<br>
maintain. The Sponsor, Prudential Securities Incorporated, is a wholly-owned,<br>
indirect subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America. The Trust<br>
has a mandatory termination date set forth under Part A--&#x27;Summary of Essential<br>
Information,&#x27; but may be terminated prior thereto upon the occurrence of certain<br>
events (see &#x27;Amendment and Termination of the Indenture--Termination&#x27;),<br>
including a reduction in the value of the Trust below the value set forth under<br>
Part A--&#x27;Summary of Essential Information.&#x27;<br>
 <br>
 On the Date of Deposit, a Unit represented the fractional undivided<br>
interest in the Securities set forth under Part A--&#x27;Summary of Essential<br>
Information&#x27; in the ratio of 1 Unit for each approximately $1.00 net asset value<br>
of Securities initially deposited in such Trust. If any Units are redeemed by<br>
the Trustee, the number of Securities in the Trust will be reduced by an amount<br>
allocable to redeemed Units and the fractional undivided interest in such Trust<br>
represented by each unredeemed Unit will be increased. Units will remain<br>
outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the Trustee by any Unit Holder (which<br>
may include the Sponsor) or until the termination of the Trust pursuant to the<br>
Indenture.<br>
 <br>
PORTFOLIO SUMMARY<br>
 <br>
 Since the Trust consists of common stocks, an investment in Units of the<br>
Trust should be made with an understanding of the risks inherent in any<br>
investment in common stock. The risks of investing in common stock include risks<br>
associated with the rights to receive payments from the issuer which are<br>
generally inferior to creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred<br>
stocks issued by, the issuer. Holders of common stock have a right to receive<br>
dividends only when and if, and in the amounts, declared by the issuer&#x27;s board<br>
of directors and to participate in amounts available for distribution by the<br>
issuer only after all other claims on the issuer have been paid or provided for.<br>
By contrast, holders of preferred stocks have the right to receive dividends at<br>
a fixed rate when and as declared by the issuer&#x27;s board of directors, normally<br>
on a cumulative basis. Dividends on cumulative preferred stock must be paid<br>
before any dividends are paid on common stock and any cumulative preferred stock<br>
dividend which has been omitted is added to future dividends payable to the<br>
holders of such cumulative preferred stock. Preferred stocks are also entitled<br>
to rights on liquidation which are senior to those of common stock. For these<br>
reasons, preferred stocks generally entail less risk than common stock.<br>
Moreover, common stock does not represent an obligation of the issuer and<br>
therefore does not offer any assurance of income or provide the degree of<br>
protection of capital of debt securities. The issuance of debt securities or<br>
even preferred stock by an issuer will create prior claims for payment of<br>
principal, interest and dividends which could adversely affect the ability and<br>
inclination of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its common stock or the<br>
rights of holders of common stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon<br>
liquidation or bankruptcy. Further, unlike debt securities which typically have<br>
a stated principal amount payable at maturity (which value will be subject to<br>
market fluctuations prior thereto), common stock has neither a fixed principal<br>
amount nor a maturity and has a value which is subject to market fluctuations<br>
for as long as the common stock remains outstanding. The value of the common<br>
stocks in the Trust thus may be expected to fluctuate over the life of the Trust<br>
to values higher or lower than those prevailing on the Date of Deposit.<br>
 <br>
 The value of the Units will fluctuate depending on all the factors that<br>
have an impact on the economy and the equity markets. These factors similarly<br>
impact on the ability of an issuer to distribute dividends. There is no<br>
assurance that any dividends will be declared or paid in the future on the<br>
Securities. The Trust is not a &#x27;managed&#x27; registered investment company and<br>
Securities will<br>
 <br>
 B-2<br>
 <br>
not be sold by the Trustee as a result of ordinary market fluctuations. The<br>
Sponsor may direct the disposition by the Trustee of Securities only upon the<br>
occurrence of certain events. (See &#x27;Sponsor--Responsibility.&#x27;)<br>
 <br>
 As it is anticipated that Securities generally will not be sold to pay the<br>
Deferred Sales Charge until after the last Deferred Sales Charge Deduction Date,<br>
Holders will be at risk with respect to changes in the market value of<br>
Securities between the accrual of each monthly deferred sales charge and the<br>
actual sale of Securities to satisfy the payment of the Deferred Sales Charge.<br>
 <br>
 The Trust consists of the Securities (and/or contracts to purchase such<br>
Securities together with an irrevocable letter or letters of credit for the<br>
purchase of such contracts and/or cash (or a letter of credit in lieu of cash)<br>
with instructions to purchase such Securities) listed under Part A--&#x27;Schedule of<br>
Portfolio Securities&#x27; herein, and the Securities deposited upon the creation of<br>
additional Units as set forth above and substitute Securities acquired by the<br>
Trust as long as such Securities may continue to be held from time to time in<br>
the Trust together with uninvested cash realized from the disposition of<br>
Securities. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee will be liable in any way for<br>
any default, failure or defect in any Securities.<br>
 <br>
 All of the Securities are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.<br>
The contracts to purchase Securities deposited initially in the Trust are<br>
expected to settle in the ordinary manner for such Securities. Settlement of the<br>
contracts for Securities is thus expected to take place prior to the settlement<br>
of Units purchased on the date of this prospectus.<br>
 <br>
 TAX STATUS OF THE TRUST<br>
 <br>
 In the opinion of Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel, special counsel for the<br>
 Sponsor, under existing Federal income tax law:<br>
 <br>
 The Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for Federal<br>
 income tax purposes, and income received by the Trust will be treated as<br>
 income of the Unit Holders in the manner set forth below.<br>
 <br>
 Each Unit Holder will be considered the owner of a pro rata portion of<br>
 each asset in the Trust under the grantor trust rules of Sections 671-678<br>
 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#x27;Code&#x27;). A Unit<br>
 Holder should determine the tax cost for each asset represented by the<br>
 Holder&#x27;s Units by allocating the total cost for such Units (including the<br>
 Initial Sales Charge) among the assets in the Trust represented by the<br>
 Units in proportion to the relative fair market values thereof on the date<br>
 the Unit Holder purchases such Units. The proceeds received by a Unit<br>
 Holder upon termination of the Trust or redemption of Units will reflect<br>
 the actual amounts paid to them, net of the Deferred Sales Charge and the<br>
 charge for organizational expenses. The relevant tax reporting forms sent<br>
 to Unit Holders will reflect the actual amount paid to them net of the<br>
 Deferred Sales Charge and the charge for organizational expenses.<br>
 Accordingly, Unit Holders should not increase the total cost for their<br>
 Units by the amount of the Deferred Sales Charge and the charge for<br>
 organizational expenses.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 A Unit Holder will be considered to have received all of the dividends<br>
 paid on the Holder&#x27;s pro rata portion of each Security when such dividends<br>
 are received by the Trust including the portion of such dividend used to<br>
 pay operating expenses. In the case of a corporate Unit Holder, such<br>
 dividends will qualify for the 70% dividends received deduction for<br>
 corporations to the same extent as though the dividend paying stock were<br>
 held directly by the corporate Unit Holder. An individual Unit Holder who<br>
 itemizes deductions will be entitled to an itemized deduction for the<br>
 Holder&#x27;s pro rata share of fees and expenses paid by the Trust as though<br>
 such fees and expenses were paid directly by the Unit Holder, but only to<br>
 the extent that this amount together with the Unit Holder&#x27;s miscellaneous<br>
 deductions exceeds 2% of the Holder&#x27;s adjusted gross income. A corporate<br>
 Unit Holder will not be subject to this 2% floor.<br>
 <br>
 Under the position taken by the Internal Revenue Service in Revenue<br>
 Ruling 90-7, a distribution by the Trustee to a Unit Holder (or to the<br>
 Distribution Agent as the Holder&#x27;s agent) of such Holder&#x27;s pro rata share<br>
 of the Securities in kind upon redemption or termination of the Trust will<br>
 not be a taxable event to the Unit Holder. Such Unit Holder&#x27;s basis for<br>
 Securities so distributed will be equal to the Holder&#x27;s basis for the same<br>
 Securities (previously represented by the Holder&#x27;s Units) prior to such<br>
 distribution and the holding period for such Securities will be the shorter<br>
 of the period during which the Unit Holder held the Units and the period<br>
 for which the Securities were held in the Trust. A Unit Holder will have a<br>
 taxable gain or loss, which will be a capital gain or loss except in the<br>
 case of a dealer, when the Unit Holder disposes of such Securities in a<br>
 taxable transfer.<br>
 <br>
 Under the income tax laws of the State and City of New York, the Trust<br>
 is not an association taxable as a corporation and the income of the Trust<br>
 will be treated as the income of the Unit Holders.<br>
 <br>
 If the proceeds received by the Distribution Agent upon the sale or<br>
redemption of an underlying Security exceed a Unit Holder&#x27;s adjusted tax cost<br>
allocable to the Security disposed of, that Unit Holder will realize a taxable<br>
gain to the extent of such excess. Conversely, if the proceeds received by the<br>
Distribution Agent upon the sale or redemption of an underlying Security are<br>
less than a Unit Holder&#x27;s adjusted tax cost allocable to the Security disposed<br>
of, that Unit Holder will realize a loss for tax purposes to the extent of such<br>
difference except that upon reinvestment of proceeds in a New Series the<br>
Internal Revenue Service may seek to disallow such loss to the extent that the<br>
underlying securities in each trust are substantially identical and the purchase<br>
of units of the New Series takes place less than thirty-one days after the sale<br>
of the underlying Security. Under the Code, net capital gain (i.e.,<br>
 <br>
 B-3<br>
 <br>
the excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss) of<br>
individuals, estates and trusts is subject to a maximum nominal tax rate of 28%.<br>
Such net capital gain may, however, result in a disallowance of itemized<br>
deductions and/or affect a personal exemption phase-out. The maximum lower net<br>
capital gain rate will be unavailable to those Unit Holders who have held their<br>
units for less than a year and a day as of the Termination Date (or earlier<br>
termination of the Trust) or any day on which a Unit Holder&#x27;s units are sold or<br>
exchanged.<br>
 <br>
 Each Unit Holder should consult his, her or its tax advisor with respect to<br>
the application of the above general information to his, her or its own personal<br>
situation.<br>
 <br>
 RETIREMENT PLANS<br>
 <br>
 Units of the Trust may be suited for purchase by Individual Retirement<br>
Accounts and pension plans or profit sharing and other qualified retirement<br>
plans. Investors considering participation in any such plan should review<br>
specific tax laws and pending legislation relating thereto and should consult<br>
their attorneys or tax advisors with respect to the establishment and<br>
maintenance of any such plan.<br>
 <br>
 PUBLIC OFFERING OF UNITS<br>
PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE<br>
 <br>
 The Public Offering Price of the Units during the initial public offering<br>
period and thereafter is computed by determining the value (as set forth below)<br>
of the Securities in the Trust, dividing such sum by the number of Units<br>
outstanding and then adding a sales charge as set forth in the table under<br>
&#x27;Volume Discount,&#x27; herein. In order to enable purchasers of Units on the date of<br>
this Prospectus to purchase Units at a Public Offering Price of $1.00 per Unit,<br>
the Units outstanding as of the Evaluation Time on the date of this Prospectus<br>
(all of which are held by the Sponsor) may be split (or split in reverse). A<br>
proportionate share of money in the Income and Principal Accounts and amounts<br>
receivable in respect of stocks trading ex-dividend other than money required to<br>
redeem previously tendered Units or money required to be distributed to Unit<br>
Holders on a Distribution Date will be added to the Public Offering Price. (See<br>
&#x27;Rights of Unit Holders--Distributions.&#x27;)<br>
 <br>
 The Public Offering Price on the date of this Prospectus or on any<br>
subsequent date will vary from the Public Offering Price as of the Date of<br>
Deposit set forth in the &#x27;Summary of Essential Information&#x27; in accordance with<br>
fluctuations in the value of the Securities in the Trust.<br>
 <br>
 The aggregate value of the Securities is determined in good faith by the<br>
Trustee on each &#x27;Business Day&#x27; as defined in the Indenture in the following<br>
manner: the evaluation is generally based on the closing trade prices on the New<br>
York Stock Exchange as of the Evaluation Time (unless the Trustee deems these<br>
prices inappropriate as a basis for valuation) or, if there is no closing trade<br>
price at that time on that exchange, at the mean between the closing bid and<br>
asked prices. If the Securities are not so listed or, if so listed and the<br>
principal market therefor is other than on the exchange, the evaluation shall<br>
generally be based on the current bid price on the over-the-counter market<br>
(unless the Trustee deems these prices inappropriate as a basis for evaluation).<br>
If current bid or closing prices are unavailable, the evaluation is determined<br>
(a) on the basis of current bid prices for comparable securities, (b) by<br>
appraising the value of the Securities on the bid side of the market or by such<br>
other appraisal deemed appropriate by the Trustee, (c) on the basis of the last<br>
trade price of the Security or (d) by any combination of the above, each as of<br>
the Evaluation Time.<br>
 <br>
 The sales charge consists of an Initial Sales Charge and a Deferred Sales<br>
Charge. The Initial Sales Charge is computed by deducting the Deferred Sales<br>
Charge ($17.50 per 1,000 Units) from the aggregate sales charge; thus on the<br>
date of the Summary of Essential Information, the maximum Initial Sales Charge,<br>
1% of the Public Offering Price, is $10 per 1,000 Units. The Initial Sales<br>
Charge is deducted from the purchase price at the time of purchase. The Deferred<br>
Sales Charge will initially be $17.50 per 1,000 Units but will be reduced each<br>
month by one tenth; the Deferred Sales Charge will be paid through monthly<br>
deductions of $1.75 per 1,000 Units per month commencing on the first Deferred<br>
Sales Charge Deduction Date as shown in the Summary of Essential Information. To<br>
the extent the entire Deferred Sales Charge has not been so deducted at the time<br>
of repurchase, redemption or exchange of the Units, any unpaid amount will be<br>
deducted from the proceeds or in calculating an in kind distribution. For<br>
purchases of Units with a value of $50,000 or more, the Initial Sales Charge is<br>
reduced on a graduated basis as shown below under &#x27;Volume Discount.&#x27; Units<br>
purchased pursuant to the Reinvestment Program are subject only to any remaining<br>
Deferred Sales Charge deductions (see &#x27;Reinvestment Program&#x27;). Unit Holders<br>
acquiring Units of the Trust pursuant to an exchange of units of a different<br>
unit investment trust will not be charged an initial sales charge at the time of<br>
the exchange but such Units acquired will be subject to the Deferred Sales<br>
Charge.<br>
 <br>
PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION<br>
 <br>
 During the initial public offering period (i) for Units issued on the Date<br>
of Deposit and (ii) for additional Units issued after such date in respect of<br>
additional deposits of Securities, Units will be distributed to the public by<br>
the Sponsor and through dealers at the Public Offering Price, calculated on each<br>
business day. The initial offering period is 30 days unless all Units are sold<br>
prior thereto, whereupon the initial public offering period will terminate. The<br>
initial public offering period may be extended by the Sponsor so long as<br>
additional deposits are being made or Units remain unsold. Upon termination of<br>
the initial offering period, in each case, unsold Units or Units acquired by the<br>
Sponsor in the secondary market referred to below may be offered to the public<br>
by this Prospectus at the then current Public Offering Price calculated daily.<br>
 <br>
 B-4<br>
 <br>
 The Sponsor intends to qualify Units in states selected by the Sponsor for<br>
sale by the Sponsor and through dealers who are members of the National<br>
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Sales to dealers will be made at prices<br>
which include a concession of 65% of the total sales charge per Unit, but<br>
subject to change from time to time at the discretion of the Sponsor. The<br>
Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the<br>
purchase of Units.<br>
 <br>
SECONDARY MARKET<br>
 <br>
 While not obligated to do so, it is the Sponsor&#x27;s present intention to<br>
maintain a secondary market for Units of the Trust and to offer continuously to<br>
repurchase Units from Unit Holders at the Sponsor&#x27;s Repurchase Price which<br>
price, subject to change at any time, will be computed as stated under &#x27;Rights<br>
of Unit Holders--Redemption--Computation of Redemption Price.&#x27; The Sponsor, of<br>
course, does not in any way guarantee the enforceability, marketability or price<br>
of any Securities in the Portfolio or of the Units. There is no sales charge<br>
incurred when a Unit Holder sells Units back to the Sponsor other than the<br>
payment of any Deferred Sales Charge then due. Any Units repurchased by the<br>
Sponsor may be reoffered to the public by the Sponsor at the then current Public<br>
Offering Price. The Sponsor will become the owner of Units repurchased as of the<br>
trade date. Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such Units will<br>
belong to the Sponsor.<br>
 <br>
 If the supply of Units exceeds demand (or for any other business reason),<br>
the Sponsor may, at any time, occasionally, from time to time, or permanently,<br>
discontinue the repurchase of Units. In such event Unit Holders wishing to<br>
dispose of their Units may redeem their Units through the Trustee. (See &#x27;Rights<br>
of Unit Holders--Redemption--Computation of Redemption Price per Unit.&#x27;) If the<br>
Sponsor repurchases Units in the secondary market at the &#x27;Redemption Price,&#x27; it<br>
may reoffer these units in the secondary market at the &#x27;Public Offering Price,&#x27;<br>
or the Sponsor may tender Units so purchased to the Trustee for redemption. In<br>
no event will the price offered by the Sponsor for the repurchase of Units be<br>
less than the current Redemption Price for those Units. (See &#x27;Rights of Unit<br>
Holders--Redemption.&#x27;) The Sponsor may, of course, redeem any Units that it has<br>
purchased in the secondary market to the extent that it determines that it is<br>
undesirable to continue to hold such Units in its inventory. Factors which the<br>
Sponsor will consider in making such a determination will include the number of<br>
units of all series of unit trusts which it has in its inventory, the<br>
saleability of such units and its estimate of the time required to sell such<br>
units and general market conditions.<br>
 <br>
PROFIT OF SPONSOR<br>
 <br>
 The Sponsor receives a sales charge as set forth in the table below in the<br>
primary market and secondary market. The Sponsor may have also realized a book<br>
profit (or a loss) on the deposit of the Securities in the Trust representing<br>
the difference between the cost of the Securities to the Sponsor and the cost of<br>
the Securities to the Trust. (For the amount of such difference on the initial<br>
deposit, see Part A--&#x27;Summary of Essential Information.&#x27;) The Sponsor may also<br>
realize profits or sustain losses in respect of Securities which were acquired<br>
from the Sponsor or from underwriting syndicates of which it was a member. (See<br>
Part A--&#x27;Portfolio Summary as of the Date of Deposit.&#x27;) An underwriter or<br>
underwriting syndicate purchases common stock from the issuer on a negotiated or<br>
competitive bid basis as principal with the motive of marketing such common<br>
stock to investors at a profit. In addition, the Sponsor may realize profits (or<br>
sustain losses) due to daily fluctuations in the value of the Securities in the<br>
Trust and thus in the Public Offering Price of Units received by the Sponsor.<br>
Cash, if any, received by the Sponsor from the Unit Holders prior to the<br>
settlement date for purchase of Securities may be used in the Sponsor&#x27;s business<br>
to the extent permitted by applicable regulations and may be of benefit to the<br>
Sponsor.<br>
 <br>
 The Sponsor may also realize profits (or sustain losses) while maintaining<br>
a secondary market in the Units, in the amount of any difference between the<br>
prices at which the Sponsor buys Units and the prices at which the Sponsor<br>
resells such Units or the prices at which the Sponsor redeems such Units, as the<br>
case may be.<br>
 <br>
VOLUME DISCOUNT<br>
 <br>
 Although under no obligation to do so, the Sponsor intends to permit volume<br>
purchasers of Units to purchase Units at a reduced sales charge. The Sponsor may<br>
at any time upon prior notice to Unit Holders change the amount by which the<br>
sales charge is reduced, or may discontinue the discount altogether.<br>
 <br>
 The sales charge for the Trust in the primary market will be reduced<br>
pursuant to the following graduated scale for sales to any person of Units with<br>
a value of $50,000 or more. The sales charge in the secondary market consists of<br>
an Initial Sales Charge which will be reduced pursuant to the following<br>
graduated scale and the remaining portions of the Deferred Sales Charge.<br>

 The reduced sales charges as shown on the chart above will apply to such<br>
purchases of Units in any fourteen-day period which qualify for the volume<br>
discount by the same person, including a partnership or corporation, other than<br>
a dealer, in the amounts stated herein, and for this purpose, purchases of Units<br>
of this Trust will be aggregated with concurrent purchases of Units of any other<br>
trust that may be offered by the Sponsor.<br>
 <br>
 Units held in the name of the purchaser&#x27;s spouse, in the name of a<br>
purchaser&#x27;s child under the age of 21 or in the name of an entity controlled by<br>
the purchaser are deemed for the purposes hereof to be acquired in the name of<br>
the purchaser. The reduced sales charges are also applicable to a trustee or<br>
other fiduciary, including a partnership or corporation, purchasing Units for a<br>
single trust estate or single fiduciary account.<br>
 <br>
EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT<br>
 <br>
 The Sponsor intends, at the discretion of the Sponsor, to permit employees<br>
of Prudential Securities Incorporated and its subsidiaries and affiliates to<br>
purchase Units of the Trust at a price equal to the net asset value of the<br>
Securities in the Trust divided by the number of Units outstanding plus a<br>
reduced sales charge equal to the Deferred Sales Charge per Unit, subject to a<br>
limit of 5% of the Units.<br>
 <br>
 EXCHANGE OPTION<br>
 <br>
 Unit Holders may elect to exchange any or all of their Units of this Series<br>
of the National Equity Trust for units of one or more of any other series in the<br>
Prudential Securities Incorporated family of unit investment trusts or for any<br>
units of any additional trusts that may from time to time be made available for<br>
such exchange by the Sponsor (collectively referred to as the &#x27;Exchange<br>
Trusts&#x27;). Such units may be acquired at prices based on reduced sales charges<br>
per unit. Units of the Low Five Portfolio Series received in exchange for Units<br>
of other unit investment trusts will be subject to a deferred sales charge only.<br>
The purpose of such reduced sales charge is to permit the Sponsor to pass on to<br>
the Unit Holder who wishes to exchange Units the cost savings resulting from<br>
such exchange of Units. The cost savings result from reductions in the time and<br>
expense related to advice, financial planning and operational expense required<br>
for the Exchange Option.<br>
 <br>
 Exchange Trusts may have different investment objectives; a Unit Holder<br>
should read the prospectus for the applicable Exchange Trust carefully to<br>
determine its investment objective prior to exercise of this option.<br>
 <br>
 This option will be available provided the Sponsor maintains a secondary<br>
market in both the Units of this Series and units of the applicable Exchange<br>
Trust and provided that units of the applicable Exchange Trust are available for<br>
sale and are lawfully qualified for sale in the jurisdiction in which the Unit<br>
Holder is a resident. While it is the Sponsor&#x27;s present intention to maintain a<br>
secondary market for the units of all such trusts, there is no obligation on its<br>
part to do so. Therefore, there is no assurance that a market for units will in<br>
fact exist on any given date on which a Unit Holder wishes to sell or exchange<br>
his Units; thus there is no assurance that the Exchange Option will be available<br>
to any Unit Holder. The Sponsor reserves the right to modify, suspend or<br>
terminate this option. Sixty days notice will be given prior to the date of the<br>
termination of or a material amendment to the Exchange Option except that no<br>
notice need be given in certain circumstances approved by the Securities and<br>
Exchange Commission. In the event the Exchange Option is not available to a Unit<br>
Holder at the time he wishes to exercise it, the Unit Holder will be immediately<br>
notified and no action will be taken with respect to his Units without further<br>
instruction from the Unit Holder.<br>
 <br>
 To exercise the Exchange Option, a Unit Holder should notify the Sponsor of<br>
his desire to exchange his Units for one or more units of the Exchange Trusts.<br>
Upon the exchange of Units of the Trust, any Deferred Sales Charge balance will<br>
be deducted from the exchange proceeds. If units of the applicable outstanding<br>
series of the Exchange Trust are at that time available for sale, the Unit<br>
Holder may select the series or group of series for which he desires his Units<br>
to be exchanged. The Unit Holder will be provided with a current prospectus or<br>
prospectuses relating to each series in which he indicates interest.<br>
 <br>
 Units of the Exchange Trust trading in the secondary market maintained by<br>
the Sponsor, if so maintained, will be sold to the Unit Holder at a price equal<br>
to the aggregate bid side evaluation per unit of the securities in that<br>
portfolio and the applicable sales charge of $15 per unit of the Exchange Trust<br>
for a trust with a 1 unit minimum purchase. The reduced sales charge for units<br>
of any Exchange Trust acquired during the initial offering period for such units<br>
will result in a price for such units equal to the offering side evaluation per<br>
unit of the securities in the Exchange Trust&#x27;s portfolio plus accrued interest,<br>
if any, plus a reduced sales charge of $25 per Exchange Trust unit. Exchange<br>
transactions will be effected only in whole units; thus, any proceeds not used<br>
to acquire<br>
 <br>
 B-6<br>
 <br>
whole units will be paid to the exchanging Unit Holder unless the Unit Holder<br>
adds the amount of cash necessary to purchase one additional whole Exchange<br>
Trust unit.<br>
 <br>
 Owners of units of any registered unit investment trust, other than<br>
Prudential Securities Incorporated sponsored trusts, which was initially offered<br>
at a minimum applicable sales charge of 3.0% of the public offering price<br>
exclusive of any applicable sales charge discounts, may elect to apply the cash<br>
proceeds of sale or redemption of those units directly to acquire units of any<br>
Exchange Trust trading in the secondary market at the reduced sales charge of<br>
$20 per Unit, subject to the terms and conditions applicable to the Exchange<br>
Option. Units of any Exchange Trust acquired during the initial offering period<br>
for such units may be sold at a price equal to the ask side evaluation per unit<br>
of the securities in the Portfolio plus a reduced sales charge of $25 per unit.<br>
To exercise this option, the owner should notify his retail broker. He will be<br>
given a prospectus of each series in which he indicates interest, units of which<br>
are available. The Sponsor reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate<br>
the option at any time without further notice, including the right to increase<br>
the reduced sales charge applicable to this option (but not in excess of $5 more<br>
per unit than the corresponding fee then charged for a unit of an Exchange Trust<br>
which is being exchanged).<br>
 <br>
 For example, assume that a Unit Holder, who has three units of a Trust with<br>
a 4.25% sales charge and a current price of $1,100 per unit, sells his units and<br>
exchanges the proceeds for units of a series of an Exchange Trust with a current<br>
price of $950 per unit and an ordinary sales charge of 4.25%. The proceeds from<br>
the Unit Holder&#x27;s units will aggregate $3,300. Since only whole units of an<br>
Exchange Trust may be purchased under the Exchange Option, the Holder would be<br>
able to acquire four units in the Exchange Trust for a total cost of $3,860<br>
($3,800 for units and $60 for the $15 per unit sales charge) by adding an extra<br>
$560 in cash. Were the Unit Holder to acquire the same number of units at the<br>
same time in the regular secondary market maintained by the Sponsor, the price<br>
would be $3,968.68 [$3,800 for the units and $168.68 for the 4.25% sales charge<br>
(4.439% of the net amount invested)].<br>
 <br>
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES<br>
 <br>
 An exchange of Units pursuant to the Exchange Option will constitute a<br>
&#x27;taxable event&#x27; under the Code, i.e., a Unit Holder will recognize gain or loss<br>
at the time of the exchange except that upon an exchange of Units of this Series<br>
of the National Equity Trust for units of any other series of the Exchange<br>
Trusts which are grantor trusts for United States federal income tax purposes<br>
the Internal Revenue Service may seek to disallow any loss incurred upon such<br>
exchange to the extent that the underlying securities in each trust are<br>
substantially identical and the purchase of units of an Exchange Trust takes<br>
place less than thirty-one days after the sale of the Units. Unit Holders are<br>
advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of<br>
exchanging Units in their particular case.<br>
 <br>
 REINVESTMENT PROGRAM<br>
 <br>
 Unit Holders may elect to have the distributions with respect to their<br>
Units automatically reinvested in additional Units of the Trust subject only to<br>
any remaining deductions of the Deferred Sales Charge. (Reinvestment Units are<br>
not subject to the Initial Sales Charge.)<br>
 <br>
 A Unit Holder holding Units in &#x27;street name&#x27; may participate in the Trust&#x27;s<br>
reinvestment program (the &#x27;Program&#x27;) by contacting his broker, dealer or<br>
financial institution. The Unit Holder&#x27;s completed notice of election to<br>
participate in the Program must be received by the Trustee at least ten days<br>
prior to the Record Date applicable to any distribution in order for the Program<br>
to be in effect as to such distribution. Elections may be modified or revoked on<br>
similar notice.<br>
 <br>
 Such distributions, to the extent reinvested in the Trust, will be used by<br>
the Trustee at the direction of the Sponsor in one or both of the following<br>
manners. (i) The distributions may be used by the Trustee to purchase Units of<br>
this Series of the Trust held in the Sponsor&#x27;s inventory. The purchase price<br>
payable by the Trustee for each of such Units will be equal to the applicable<br>
Trust evaluation per Unit on (or as soon as possible after) the close of<br>
business on the Distribution Date. The Units so purchased by the Trustee will be<br>
issued or credited to the accounts of Unit Holders participating in the Program.<br>
(ii) If there are no Units in the Sponsor&#x27;s inventory, the Sponsor may purchase<br>
additional Securities for deposit into the Trust (as described in Part B, &#x27;The<br>
Trust&#x27;). The additional Securities with any necessary cash will be deposited by<br>
the Sponsor with the Trustee in exchange for new Units. The distributions may<br>
then be used by the Trustee to purchase the new Units from the Sponsor. The<br>
price for such new Units will be the applicable Trust evaluation per Unit on (or<br>
as soon as possible after) the close of business on the Distribution Date. (See<br>
&#x27;Public Offering of Units--Public Offering Price.&#x27;) The Units so purchased by<br>
the Trustee will be issued or credited to the accounts of Unit Holders<br>
participating in the Program. The Sponsor may terminate the Program if it does<br>
not have sufficient Units in its inventory or if it is no longer deemed<br>
practical to create additional Units.<br>
 <br>
 No fractional Units will be issued under any circumstances. If, after the<br>
maximum number of full Units has been issued or credited at the applicable<br>
price, there remains a portion of the distribution which is not sufficient to<br>
purchase a full Unit at such price, the Trustee will distribute such cash to<br>
Unit Holders. The cost of administering the reinvestment program will be borne<br>
by the Trust and thus will be borne indirectly by all Unit Holders.<br>
 <br>
 B-7<br>
 <br>
 TERMINATION OPTIONS<br>
 <br>
 The Trust will terminate on the Termination Date set forth in the Summary<br>
of Essential Information, approximately one year after the Date of Deposit<br>
(unless terminated earlier; see part B--&#x27;Amendment and Termination of the<br>
Indenture--Termination&#x27;). A Unit Holder&#x27;s Units will be redeemed in kind on the<br>
Termination Date by distribution of the Unit Holder&#x27;s pro rata share of the<br>
Securities and any cash in the Portfolio of the Trust on such date to the<br>
Distribution Agent who will act as agent for such Unit Holder.<br>
 <br>
 SECURITIES DISPOSITION OPTIONS--A Unit Holder who so elects by notifying<br>
the Trustee prior to the Termination Date of the Trust will have the Securities<br>
received on the Termination Date disposed of on behalf of such Unit Holder by<br>
the Distribution Agent in accordance with one or more of the following three<br>
options as elected by such Unit Holder:<br>
 <br>
 1. to have such underlying Securities distributed in kind no later<br>
 than the business day next following the Termination Date. Unit Holders<br>
 subsequently selling such distributed Securities will incur brokerage costs<br>
 when disposing of such Securities;<br>
 <br>
 2. to receive the Unit Holder&#x27;s pro rata share of the cash received<br>
 by the Distribution Agent (less expenses) upon the sale by the Distribution<br>
 Agent of the underlying Securities attributable to Unit Holders electing<br>
 this option over a period not to exceed 10 business days immediately<br>
 following the Termination Date. Amounts received by the Distribution Agent<br>
 over such 10 business day period representing the proceeds of the<br>
 underlying Securities sold will be held by The Chase Manhattan Bank<br>
 (National Association) in accounts which are non-interest bearing to Unit<br>
 Holders and which are available for use by The Chase Manhattan Bank<br>
 (National Association) pursuant to normal banking procedures and will be<br>
 distributed to Unit Holders within 5 business days after the settlement of<br>
 the trade for the last Security to be sold; and/or<br>
 <br>
 3. to invest the proceeds from the sale of the underlying Securities<br>
 attributable to Unit Holders electing this option within 30 days of the<br>
 Termination Date, as received by the Distribution Agent upon the sale of<br>
 such underlying Securities over a period not to exceed 10 business days<br>
 immediately following the Termination Date, in units of a subsequent series<br>
 of National Equity Trust as designated by the Sponsor (the &#x27;New Series&#x27;) if<br>
 such New Series is offered at such time. The Units of a New Series will be<br>
 purchased by the Unit Holder upon the settlement of the trade for the last<br>
 Security to be sold. Such purchaser will be entitled to a reduced sales<br>
 load upon the purchase of units of the New Series. It is expected that the<br>
 terms of the New Series will be substantially the same as the terms of the<br>
 Trust described in this Prospectus, and that similar options in a<br>
 subsequent series of the Trust will occur in each New Series of the Trust<br>
 approximately one year after that New Series&#x27; creation. The availability of<br>
 this option does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to purchase<br>
 Units of a New Series or any other security. A Unit Holder&#x27;s election to<br>
 participate in this option will be treated as an indication of interest<br>
 only. At any time prior to the purchase by the Unit Holder of units of a<br>
 New Series, such Unit Holder may change his investment strategy and<br>
 receive, in cash, the proceeds of the sale of the Securities.<br>
 <br>
 Unit Holders who do not elect as set forth above will have their Units<br>
redeemed on the Termination Date and be deemed to have elected to receive the<br>
cash proceeds from the sale of such Unit Holder&#x27;s pro rata share of the<br>
underlying Securities (option 2).<br>
 <br>
 Under each option a Unit Holder will receive the Redemption Price per Unit<br>
(net asset value) determined as of the Evaluation Time on the Termination Date.<br>
The Distribution Agent will sell the underlying Securities in the case of the<br>
second and third option over a period not to exceed 10 business days immediately<br>
following the Termination Date. The proceeds of any such sales will be reduced<br>
by any applicable brokerage commissions. The sale arrangement is one in which<br>
The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association) will be selling the Securities<br>
as agent for the Unit Holder and is separate from the Trust which terminates on<br>
the Termination Date. The proceeds of such sales may be more or less than the<br>
value of the Securities on the Termination Date. The Sponsor, on behalf of the<br>
Distribution Agent if the Sponsor effects such sales, or the Distribution Agent<br>
if the Sponsor does not, will, unless prevented by unusual and unforeseen<br>
circumstances, such as, among other reasons, a suspension in trading of a<br>
Security, the close of a stock exchange, outbreak of hostilities and collapse of<br>
the economy, sell on each business day during the 10 business day period at<br>
least a number of shares of each Security which then remains in the Portfolio<br>
equal to the number of such shares in the Portfolio at the beginning of such day<br>
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is one and the denominator of<br>
which is the number of days remaining in the 10 business day sales period. The<br>
proceeds of sale will not be distributed by the Distribution Agent until the<br>
settlement of the trade upon the sale of the last Security during the 10<br>
business day period.<br>
 <br>
 Depending on the amount of proceeds to be invested in Units of the New<br>
Series and the number of other orders for Units in the New Series, the Sponsor<br>
may purchase a large amount of securities for the New Series in a short period<br>
of time. The Sponsor&#x27;s buying of securities may tend to raise the market prices<br>
of these Securities. The actual market impact of the Sponsor&#x27;s purchases,<br>
however, is currently unpredictable because the actual amount of securities to<br>
be purchased and the supply and price of those securities is unknown. A similar<br>
problem may occur in connection with the sale of Securities during the 10<br>
business day period following the Termination Date; depending on the number of<br>
sales required, the prices of, and demand for Securities, such sales may tend to<br>
depress the market prices and thus reduce the proceeds to be credited to Unit<br>
Holders. The Sponsor believes that the sale of underlying Securities over a 10<br>
business day period as described above is in the best interest of Unit Holders<br>
and may mitigate the negative market price consequences stemming from the<br>
trading of large amounts of Securities. The Sponsor, in implementing such sales<br>
of Securities on behalf of the Distribution Agent, will seek to maximize the<br>
sales proceeds and will act in<br>
 <br>
 B-8<br>
 <br>
the best interest of the Unit Holder. The proceeds of the sale of the Securities<br>
will be in an amount equal to amounts realized upon the sale of the Securities<br>
over the 10 business day period. There can be no assurance, however, that any<br>
adverse price consequences of heavy trading will be mitigated.<br>
 <br>
 It should also be noted that Unit Holders will realize taxable capital<br>
gains or losses on the liquidation of the Securities representing their Units,<br>
but, due to the procedures for investing in the New Series, no cash would be<br>
distributed at that time to pay any taxes.<br>
 <br>
 The Sponsor may for any reason, in its sole discretion, decide not to<br>
sponsor any subsequent series of the Trust, without penalty or incurring<br>
liability to any Unit Holder. If the Sponsor so decides, the Sponsor will notify<br>
the Trustee of that decision, and the Trustee will notify the Unit Holders<br>
before the Termination Date. All Unit Holders will then elect either option 1 or<br>
option 2.<br>
 <br>
 By electing to reinvest in the New Series, the Unit Holder indicates his<br>
interest in having his terminating distribution from the Trust invested only in<br>
the New Series created next following termination of the Trust; the Sponsor<br>
expects, however, that a similar reinvestment program will be offered with<br>
respect to all subsequent series of the Trust, thus giving Unit Holders a yearly<br>
opportunity to elect to &#x27;rollover&#x27; their terminating distributions into a New<br>
Series. The availability of the reinvestment privilege does not constitute a<br>
solicitation of offers to purchase units of a New Series or any other security.<br>
A Unit Holder&#x27;s election to participate in the reinvestment program will be<br>
treated as an indication of interest only. The Sponsor intends to coordinate the<br>
date of deposit of a future series so that the terminating trust will terminate<br>
contemporaneously with the creation of a New Series.<br>
 <br>
 The Sponsor reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate the<br>
reinvestment privilege at any time.<br>
 <br>
 EXPENSES AND CHARGES<br>
 <br>
EXPENSES<br>
 <br>
 All or a portion of the Organizational expenses and charges incurred in<br>
connection with the establishment of the Trust including the cost of the<br>
preparation, printing and execution of the Indenture, Registration Statement and<br>
other documents relating to the Trust, Federal and State registration fees and<br>
costs, the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee, legal and auditing expenses<br>
and other out-of-pocket expenses, will be paid by the Trust. Historically, the<br>
costs of establishing unit investment trusts have been borne by a trust&#x27;s<br>
sponsor. Advertising and selling expenses will be paid by the Sponsor and the<br>
underwriters, if any, at no cost to the Trust.<br>
 <br>
FEES<br>
 <br>
 The Sponsor&#x27;s fee (the &#x27;Supervisory Fee&#x27;), earned for portfolio supervisory<br>
services, is based upon the largest number of Units outstanding during the life<br>
of the Trust. The Supervision Fee is as set forth in Part A, &#x27;Summary of<br>
Essential Information&#x27; and may exceed the actual costs of providing portfolio<br>
supervisory services for this Trust, but at no time will the total amount the<br>
Sponsor receives for portfolio supervisory services rendered to all series of<br>
the National Equity Trust in any calendar year exceed the aggregate cost to it<br>
of supplying such services in such year. The Supervisory Fee will be paid to the<br>
Sponsor by the Trust. (See &#x27;Sponsor--Responsibility.&#x27;) For its service as<br>
Trustee under the Indenture, the Trustee receives an annual fee in the amount<br>
set forth under Part A--&#x27;Summary of Essential Information.&#x27; The Trustee&#x27;s fee<br>
and the Trust expenses accrue monthly and are payable quarterly on or before<br>
each Distribution Date from the Income Account, to the extent funds are<br>
available and thereafter from the Principal Account. Such Trustee&#x27;s fee may be<br>
increased without approval of the Unit Holders in proportion to increases under<br>
the classification &#x27;All Services Less Rent&#x27; in the Consumer Price Index<br>
published by the United States Department of Labor but such fee will not be<br>
increased in excess of increases in the Trustee&#x27;s costs. The Trustee also<br>
receives benefits to the extent that it holds funds on deposit in various<br>
non-interest bearing accounts created under the Indenture.<br>
 <br>
OTHER CHARGES<br>
 <br>
 The following additional charges are or may be incurred by the Trust as<br>
more fully described in the Indenture: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary<br>
services, (b) expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses)<br>
and of counsel designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d)<br>
expenses and costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trust and<br>
the rights and interests of the Unit Holders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee<br>
for any losses, liabilities or expenses incurred by it in the administration of<br>
the Trust without negligence, bad faith, willful misfeasance or willful<br>
misconduct on its part or reckless disregard of its obligations and duties, (f)<br>
indemnification of the Sponsor for any losses, liabilities and expenses incurred<br>
in acting as Sponsor or Depositor under the Indenture without gross negligence,<br>
bad faith, willful misfeasance or willful misconduct or reckless disregard of<br>
its obligations and duties, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unit Holders<br>
upon termination of the Trust and (h) to the extent then lawful, expenses<br>
(including legal, auditing and printing expenses) of maintaining registration or<br>
qualification of the Units and/or the Trust under Federal or State securities<br>
laws so long as the Sponsor is maintaining a market for the Units.<br>
 <br>
 B-9<br>
 <br>
 The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trust and<br>
when paid by or owing to the Trustee are secured by a lien on the property of<br>
the Trust. If the balance in the Income and Principal Accounts are insufficient<br>
to provide for amounts payable by the Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell<br>
Securities to pay such amounts. To the extent Securities are sold, the size of<br>
such Trust will be reduced and the proportions of the various Securities in the<br>
Trust may change. Such sales might be required at a time such as to result in<br>
lower prices than might otherwise be realized. Moreover, due to the minimum<br>
proceeds of sale of a Security the proceeds of such sales may exceed the amount<br>
necessary for the payment of such fees and expenses.<br>
 <br>
 RIGHTS OF UNIT HOLDERS<br>
 <br>
OWNERSHIP OF UNITS<br>
 <br>
 Unit Holders are required to hold their Units in uncertificated form. The<br>
Trustee will credit a Unit Holder&#x27;s account with the number of Units held by the<br>
Unit Holder. Units are transferable only on the records of the Trustee upon<br>
presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee for each transfer and any<br>
sums payable for taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon these<br>
transactions and compliance with the formalities necessary to redeem Units.<br>
 <br>
CERTAIN LIMITATIONS<br>
 <br>
 The death or incapacity of any Unit Holder will not operate to terminate<br>
the Trust nor entitle the legal representatives or heirs of such Unit Holder to<br>
claim an accounting or to take any other action or proceeding in any court for a<br>
partition or winding up of the Trust.<br>
 <br>
 No Unit Holder shall have the right to vote except with respect to removal<br>
of the Trustee or amendment and termination of the Trust as prescribed in the<br>
Indenture (see &#x27;Administration of the Trust--Amendment&#x27; and &#x27;Administration of<br>
the Trust--Termination&#x27;). Unit Holders shall have no right to control the<br>
operation or administration of the Trust in any manner.<br>
 <br>
DISTRIBUTIONS<br>
 <br>
 Cash amounts received by the Trust will be distributed as set forth below<br>
on a pro rata basis to Unit Holders of record as of the preceding Record Date.<br>
All distributions will be net of applicable expenses and funds required for the<br>
redemption of Units. (See &#x27;Summary of Essential Information,&#x27; &#x27;Expenses and<br>
Charges&#x27; and &#x27;Rights of Unit Holders--Redemption.&#x27;) Because the expenses of the<br>
Trust may exceed the dividend income received by the Trust there can be no<br>
assurance that there will be any amounts available for distribution to Unit<br>
Holders. See &#x27;Expenses and Charges--Other Charges.&#x27;<br>
 <br>
 The Trustee will credit to the Income Account all cash dividends received<br>
by and payable to the Trust. Other cash receipts will be credited to the<br>
Principal Account. The pro rata share of the Income Account and the pro rata<br>
share of cash in the Principal Account represented by each Unit will be computed<br>
by the Trustee as of the Record Date. (See &#x27;Summary of Essential Information&#x27; in<br>
Part A.) Proceeds received from the disposition of any of the Securities not<br>
used to redeem Units or pay Trust expenses will be distributed on the fifth<br>
business day following the receipt of such proceeds to Unit Holders of record on<br>
the business day following the receipt of such proceeds by the Trustee. The<br>
distribution to Unit Holders as of each Record Date will be made on the<br>
following Distribution Date or shortly thereafter (approximately 15 days after<br>
the Record Date) and shall consist of an amount equal to such Unit Holders&#x27; pro<br>
rata share of the income credited to the Income Account after deducting<br>
estimated expenses (the &#x27;Income Distribution&#x27;). Persons who purchase Units<br>
between a Record Date and a Distribution Date will receive their first<br>
distribution on the second Distribution Date following their purchase of Units.<br>
The Trustee may make additional distributions to Unit Holders on such dates as<br>
the Sponsor shall direct. No distribution need be made from the Principal<br>
Account if the balance therein is less than an amount sufficient to distribute<br>
$1.00 per 1,000 Units. Funds which are available for future distributions,<br>
payments of expenses and redemptions are in accounts which are non-interest<br>
bearing to Unit Holders and are available for use by The Chase Manhattan Bank<br>
(National Association), pursuant to normal banking procedures.<br>
 <br>
 As of each Distribution Date the Trustee will deduct from the Income<br>
Account and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal<br>
Account, amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trust. (See &#x27;Expenses and<br>
Charges.&#x27;) The Trustee may also withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if<br>
any, as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges<br>
payable out of the Trust. Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of<br>
a Trust&#x27;s assets for purposes of determining the amount of distributions until<br>
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the<br>
appropriate account. In addition, the Trustee may withdraw from the Income<br>
Account and the Principal Account such amounts as may be necessary to cover<br>
redemption of Units by the Trustee. (See &#x27;Rights of Unit Holders--Redemption.&#x27;)<br>
 <br>
 It is anticipated that the deferred sales charge will reduce the Principal<br>
Account and that amounts in the Principal Account will be sufficient to cover<br>
the cost of the deferred sales charge. Distributions of amounts necessary to pay<br>
the deferred portion of the sales charge will be made to an account maintained<br>
by the Trustee for purposes of satisfying Unit Holders&#x27; deferred sales charge<br>
obligations. Although the Sponsor has the right to collect the deferred sales<br>
charge monthly, in order to keep Unit Holders as fully<br>
 <br>
 B-10<br>
 <br>
invested as possible, it is anticipated that no Securities will be sold to pay<br>
the deferred sales charge to the Sponsor until after the Termination Date set<br>
forth in the Summary of Essential Information.<br>
 <br>
 The Trustee will follow a policy that it will place securities acquisition<br>
or disposition transactions with a broker or dealer only if it expects to obtain<br>
the most favorable prices and executions of orders. Transactions in securities<br>
held in the Trust are generally made in brokerage transactions (as distinguished<br>
from principal transactions) and the Sponsor may act as broker therein and<br>
receive commissions thereon if the Trustee expects thereby to obtain the most<br>
favorable prices and execution. The furnishing of statistical and research<br>
information to the Trustee by any of the securities dealers through which<br>
transactions are executed will not be considered in placing securities<br>
transactions.<br>
 <br>
REPORTS AND RECORDS<br>
 <br>
 With each distribution, the Trustee will furnish to the Unit Holders a<br>
statement of the amount of dividends and other receipts, if any, distributed,<br>
expressed in each case as a dollar amount per Unit.<br>
 <br>
 Within a reasonable time after the end of each calendar year, the Trustee<br>
will furnish to each person who was a Unit Holder of record at any time during<br>
the calendar year a statement setting forth: (1) as to the Income Account:<br>
dividends and other cash amounts received, deductions for payment of applicable<br>
taxes and for fees and expenses of the Trust, redemptions of Units, and the<br>
balance remaining after such distributions and deductions, expressed both as a<br>
total dollar amount and as a dollar amount representing the pro rata share of<br>
each Unit outstanding on the last business day of such calendar year; (2) as to<br>
the Principal Account: the dates of disposition and identity of any Securities<br>
and the net proceeds received therefrom, deductions for payments of applicable<br>
taxes, for fees and expenses of the Trust, for portions of the Deferred Sales<br>
Charge and redemptions of Units, and the balance remaining after such<br>
distributions and deductions, expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a<br>
dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each Unit outstanding on the<br>
last business day of such calendar year; (3) a list of the Securities held and<br>
the number of Units outstanding on the last business day of such calendar year;<br>
(4) the Redemption Price per Unit based upon the last computation thereof made<br>
during such calendar year; and (5) amounts actually distributed during such<br>
calendar year from the Income Account and from the Principal Account, separately<br>
stated, expressed both as total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts<br>
representing the pro rata share of each Unit outstanding on the last business<br>
day of such calendar year. The accounts of the Trust may be audited not less<br>
frequently than annually by independent certified public accountants designated<br>
by the Sponsor, and the report of such accountants will be furnished by the<br>
Trustee to Unit Holders upon request.<br>
 <br>
 The Trustee shall keep available for inspection by Unit Holders at all<br>
reasonable times during usual business hours, books of record and account of its<br>
transactions as Trustee, including records of the names and addresses of Unit<br>
Holders, a current list of Securities in the Portfolio and a copy of the<br>
Indenture.<br>
 <br>
REDEMPTION<br>
 <br>
 Tender of Units<br>
 <br>
 Units may be tendered to the Trustee for redemption at its unit investment<br>
trust office at 770 Broadway, New York, New York 10003, upon delivery of a<br>
request for redemption and payment of any relevant tax. No redemption fee will<br>
be charged by the Sponsor or the Trustee. Units redeemed by the Trustee will be<br>
cancelled.<br>
 <br>
 Unit Holders must have their signature guaranteed by an officer of a<br>
national bank or trust company or by a member firm of either the New York,<br>
Midwest or Pacific Stock Exchanges. In certain instances the Trustee may require<br>
additional documents such as, but not limited to, trust instruments,<br>
certificates of death, appointments as executor or administrator or certificates<br>
of corporate authority.<br>
 <br>
 Within seven calendar days following such tender, or if the seventh<br>
calendar day is not a business day, on the first business day prior thereto, a<br>
Unit Holder (including the Sponsor) will be entitled to receive in kind an<br>
amount for each Unit tendered equal to the Redemption Price per Unit computed as<br>
of the Evaluation Time set forth in the &#x27;Summary of Essential Information&#x27; in<br>
Part A on the date of tender (see &#x27;Redemption--Computation of Redemption Price<br>
per Unit&#x27;). The &#x27;date of tender&#x27; is deemed to be the date on which Units are<br>
received by the Trustee, except that as regards Units received after the<br>
Evaluation Time, the date of tender is the next day on which the New York Stock<br>
Exchange is open from trading, and such Units will be deemed to have been<br>
tendered to the Trustee on such day for redemption at the Redemption Price<br>
computed on that day.<br>
 <br>
 The Trustee will redeem Units in kind. A Unit Holder will be able (except<br>
during a period described below), not later than the seventh calendar day<br>
following such tender (or if the seventh calendar day is not a business day on<br>
the first business day prior thereto), to receive in kind an amount per Unit<br>
equal to the Redemption Price per Unit as determined as of the day of tender. In<br>
kind distributions (the &#x27;In Kind Distribution&#x27;) will take the form of whole<br>
shares of Securities. Cash will be distributed in lieu of fractional shares and<br>
will be distributed in cash. The cash and the whole shares will aggregate an<br>
amount equal to the Redemption Price per Unit.<br>
 <br>
 B-11<br>
 <br>
 Distributions in kind on redemption of Units shall be held by The Chase<br>
Manhattan Bank (National Association), as the Distribution Agent, whom each Unit<br>
Holder shall be deemed to have designated as his agent upon purchase of a Unit,<br>
for the account, and for disposition in accordance with the instructions of, the<br>
tendering Unit Holder as follows:<br>
 <br>
 (a) The Distribution Agent shall sell the In Kind Distribution as of<br>
 the close of business on the date of tender or as soon thereafter as<br>
 possible and remit to the Unit Holder not later than seven calendar days<br>
 thereafter the net proceeds of sale, after deducting brokerage commissions<br>
 and transfer taxes, if any, on the sale unless the tendering Unit Holder<br>
 requests a distribution of the Securities as set forth in paragraph (b)<br>
 below. The Distribution Agent may sell the Securities through the Sponsor,<br>
 and the Sponsor may charge brokerage commissions on those sales. Since<br>
 these proceeds will be net of brokerage commissions, Unit Holders who wish<br>
 to receive cash for their Units should always offer them for sale to the<br>
 Sponsor in the secondary market before seeking redemption by the Trustee.<br>
 The Trustee may offer Units tendered to it for redemption and cash<br>
 liquidation to the Sponsor on behalf of any Unit Holder, to obtain this<br>
 more favorable price for the Unit Holder.<br>
 <br>
 (b) If the tendering Unit Holder requests distribution in kind and<br>
 tenders Units with a value in excess of $250,000, the Trustee shall sell<br>
 any portion of the In Kind Distribution represented by fractional interests<br>
 in shares in accordance with the foregoing and distribute the net cash<br>
 proceeds plus any other distributable cash to the tendering Unit Holder<br>
 together with certificates representing whole shares of each of the<br>
 Securities comprising the In Kind Distribution. (In a case in which the<br>
 Unit Holder requests a distribution in kind, the Trustee may, in lieu of<br>
 distributing Securities in kind to the Unit Holder, offer the Sponsor the<br>
 opportunity to acquire the tendered Units in exchange for the number of<br>
 shares of each Security and cash which the Unit Holder is otherwise<br>
 entitled to receive from the Trust. The federal income tax consequences to<br>
 the Unit Holder would be identical in either case.)<br>
 <br>
 Any amounts paid on redemption representing income received will be<br>
withdrawn from the Income Account to the extent funds are available. In<br>
addition, in implementing the redemption procedures described above, the Trustee<br>
and the Distribution Agent shall make any adjustments necessary to reflect<br>
differences between the Redemption Price of the Units and the value of the In<br>
Kind Distribution in whole shares as of the date of tender. To the extent that<br>
Units are redeemed, the size of the Trust will be reduced.<br>
 <br>
 The right of redemption may be suspended and payment of the Redemption<br>
Price per Unit postponed for more than seven calendar days following a tender of<br>
Units for redemption for any period during which the New York Stock Exchange is<br>
closed, other than for weekend and holiday closing, or trading on that Exchange<br>
is restricted or during which (as determined by the Securities and Exchange<br>
Commission) an emergency exists as a result of which disposal or evaluation of<br>
the Securities is not reasonably practicable, or for such other periods as the<br>
Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit. Neither the Trustee nor<br>
the Sponsor is liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damage that<br>
may result from any such suspension or postponement.<br>
 <br>
PURCHASE BY THE SPONSOR OF UNITS TENDERED FOR REDEMPTION<br>
 <br>
 The Indenture requires that the Trustee notify the Sponsor of any tender of<br>
Units for redemption. So long as the Sponsor is maintaining a secondary market<br>
for Units, the Sponsor, prior to the close of business on the day of tender, may<br>
purchase any Units tendered to the Trustee for redemption by making payment<br>
therefor to the Unit Holder in an amount not less than the Redemption Price and<br>
not later than the day on which the Units would otherwise have been redeemed by<br>
the Trustee, i.e., the Unit Holder will receive the Redemption Price from the<br>
Sponsor within 7 days of the date of tender (see &#x27;Public Offering of<br>
Units--Secondary Market&#x27;). Units held by the Sponsor may be tendered to the<br>
Trustee for redemption as any other Units. The offering price of any Units<br>
resold by the Sponsor will be the Public Offering Price determined in the manner<br>
provided in this Prospectus (see &#x27;Public Offering of Units--Public Offering<br>
Price&#x27;). Any profit resulting from the resale of such Units will belong to the<br>
Sponsor, which likewise will bear any loss resulting from a reduction in the<br>
offering or redemption price subsequent to its acquisition of such Units (see<br>
&#x27;Public Offering of Units--Profit of Sponsor&#x27;).<br>
 <br>
COMPUTATION OF REDEMPTION PRICE PER UNIT<br>
 <br>
 The Redemption Price per Unit of the Trust is determined by the Trustee as<br>
of the Evaluation Time on the date any such determination is made. The<br>
Redemption Price per Unit is each Unit&#x27;s pro rata share, determined by the<br>
Trustee of: (1) the aggregate value of the Securities in the Trust, (2) cash on<br>
hand in the Trust including dividends receivable on stocks trading ex-dividend<br>
as of the date of computation and (3) any other assets of the Trust, less (a)<br>
amounts representing taxes or governmental charges payable out of a Trust, (b)<br>
the accrued but unpaid expenses of the Trust and accrued Deferred Sales Charges<br>
and any Deferred Sales Charge balance, and (c) cash held for distribution to<br>
Unit Holders of record as of a date prior to the evaluation.<br>
 <br>
 B-12<br>
 <br>
 The aggregate value of the Securities is determined in good faith by the<br>
Trustee in the following manner: the evaluation is generally based on the<br>
closing trade prices as of the Evaluation Time on the New York Stock Exchange<br>
(unless the Trustee deems these prices inappropriate as a basis for valuation)<br>
or, if there is no closing trade price on that exchange, at the mean between the<br>
closing bid and asked prices. If the Securities are not so listed or, if so<br>
listed and the principal market therefor is other than on that exchange, the<br>
evaluation shall generally be based on the current bid price on the<br>
over-the-counter market (unless the Trustee deems these prices inappropriate as<br>
a basis for evaluation). If current bid or closing prices are unavailable, the<br>
evaluation is generally determined (a) on the basis of current bid prices for<br>
comparable securities, (b) by appraising the value of the Securities on the bid<br>
side of the market or by such other appraisal deemed appropriate by the Trustee,<br>
(c) on the basis of the last trade price of the Security or (d) by any<br>
combination of the above, each as of the Evaluation Time.<br>

 On October 21, 1993, Prudential Securities entered into an omnibus<br>
settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#x27;SEC&#x27;), state<br>
securities regulators (with the exception of the Texas Securities Commissioner<br>
who joined the settlement on January 18, 1994) and the National Association of<br>
Securities Dealers, Inc. (the &#x27;NASD&#x27;) to resolve allegations that from 1980<br>
through 1990 Prudential Securities sold certain limited partnership interests in<br>
violation of securities laws to persons for whom such securities were not<br>
suitable and misrepresented the safety, potential returns and liquidity of these<br>
investments. Without admitting or denying the allegations asserted against it,<br>
Prudential Securities consented to the entry of an SEC Administrative Order<br>
which stated that Prudential Securities conduct violated the federal securities<br>
laws, directed Prudential Securities to cease and desist from violating the<br>
federal securities laws, pay civil penalties, and adopt certain remedial<br>
measures to address the violations.<br>
 <br>
 Pursuant to the terms of the SEC settlement, Prudential Securities agreed<br>
to the imposition of $10,000,000 civil penalty, established a settlement fund in<br>
the amount of $300,000,000 and procedures to resolve legitimate claims for<br>
compensatory damages by purchasers of the partnership interests. Prudential<br>
Securities settlement with the state securities regulators included an agreement<br>
to pay a penalty of $500,000 per jurisdiction. Prudential Securities consented<br>
to a censure and to the payment of a $5,000,000 fine in settling the NASD<br>
action.<br>
 <br>
 In October 1994, a criminal complaint was filed with the United States<br>
Magistrate for the Southern District of New York alleging that Prudential<br>
Securities committed fraud in connection with the sale of certain limited<br>
partnership interests in violation of federal securities laws. An agreement was<br>
simultaneously filed to defer prosecution of these charges for a period of three<br>
years from the signing of the agreement, provided that Prudential Securities<br>
complies with the terms of the agreement. If, upon completion of the three year<br>
period, Prudential Securities has complied with the terms of the agreement, no<br>
prosecution will be instituted by the United States for the offenses charged in<br>
the complaint. If on the other hand, during the course of the three year period,<br>
Prudential Securities violates the terms of the agreement, the U.S. Attorney can<br>
then elect to pursue these charges. Under the terms of the agreement, Prudential<br>
Securities agreed, among other things, to pay an additional $300,000,000 into<br>
the fund established by the SEC to pay restitution to investors who purchased<br>
certain Prudential Securities limited partnership interests.<br>

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY<br>
 <br>
 The Sponsor is liable for the performance of its obligations arising from<br>
its responsibilities under the Indenture, but will be under no liability to Unit<br>
Holders for taking any action or refraining from taking any action in good faith<br>
or for errors in judgment or be liable or responsible in any way for any<br>
default, failure or defect in any Security or for depreciation or loss incurred<br>
by reason of the sale of any Securities, except in cases of willful misfeasance,<br>
bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations and duties<br>
(see &#x27;Sponsor--Responsibility&#x27;).<br>
 <br>
RESPONSIBILITY<br>
 <br>
 The Trust is not a managed registered investment company. Securities will<br>
not be sold by the Trustee to take advantage of ordinary market fluctuations.<br>
 <br>
 Although the Sponsor and Trustee do not presently intend to dispose of<br>
Securities, the Indenture permits the Sponsor to direct the Trustee to dispose<br>
of any Security upon the happening of certain events, including, without<br>
limitation, default under certain documents or other occurrences, including<br>
legal actions which might adversely affect future declaration and payment of<br>
dividends, institution of certain legal proceedings, and a decline in market<br>
price to such an extent, or such other adverse market or credit factor, as in<br>
the opinion of the Sponsor would make retention of a Security detrimental to the<br>
Trust and to the interests of the Unit Holders or if required to pay the<br>
Deferred Sales Charge. The Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to tender a Security<br>
for cash or sell the Security on the open market when in its opinion it is in<br>
the best interest of the Unit Holders to do so in the event of a public tender<br>
offer or merger or acquisition announcement.<br>
 <br>
 The Sponsor and/or an affiliate thereof intend to continuously monitor<br>
developments affecting the Securities in the Trust in order to determine whether<br>
the Trustee should be directed to dispose of any such Securities.<br>
 <br>
 It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to instruct the Trustee to reject<br>
any offer made by an issuer of any of the Securities to issue new securities in<br>
exchange and substitution for any Security pursuant to a recapitalization or<br>
reorganization, except that the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept such<br>
an offer or to take any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may<br>
deem proper if the issuer failed to declare or pay or the Sponsor anticipates<br>
such issuer will fail to pay or declare anticipated dividends with respect<br>
thereto. If the Trust receives the securities of another issuer as the result of<br>
a merger or reorganization of, or a spin-off, or split-up by the issuer of a<br>
Security included in the original Portfolio, the Trust may under certain<br>
circumstances hold those securities as if they were one of the Securities<br>
initially deposited and adjust the proportionate relationship accordingly for<br>
all future subsequent deposits.<br>
 <br>
 Any securities so received in exchange or substitution will be held by the<br>
Trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture to the same extent<br>
as Securities originally deposited thereunder. Within five days after the<br>
deposit of securities in exchange or substitution for any of the underlying<br>
Securities, the Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each Unit Holder,<br>
identifying the Securities eliminated and the Securities substituted therefor.<br>
Except as otherwise set forth in the Prospectus, the acquisition by the Trust of<br>
any securities other than the Securities initially deposited is prohibited.<br>
 <br>
 The proceeds resulting from the disposition of any Security in the Trust<br>
will be distributed as set forth under &#x27;Rights of Unit Holders--Distributions&#x27;<br>
to the extent such proceeds are not utilized for the purpose of redeeming Units<br>
or paying Trust expenses.<br>
 <br>
RESIGNATION<br>
 <br>
 If at any time the Sponsor shall resign under the Indenture or shall fail<br>
to perform or be incapable of performing its duties thereunder or shall become<br>
bankrupt or its affairs are taken over by public authorities, the Indenture<br>
directs the Trustee to either (1) appoint a successor Sponsor or Sponsors at<br>
rates of compensation deemed reasonable by the Trustee not exceeding amounts<br>
prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, (2) act as Sponsor itself<br>
without terminating the Trust or (3) terminate the Trust. The Trustee will<br>
promptly notify Unit Holders of any such action.<br>
 <br>
 TRUSTEE<br>
 <br>
 The Trustee is The Chase Manhattan Bank (National Association), a national<br>
banking association with its principal executive office located at 1 Chase<br>
Manhattan Plaza, New York, New York 10081 and its unit investment trust office<br>
at 770 Broadway, New York, New York 10003. The Trustee is subject to supervision<br>
by the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation<br>
and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In connection with the<br>
storage and handling of certain Securities deposited in the Trust, the Trustee<br>
may use the services of The Depository Trust Company. These services may include<br>
safekeeping of the Securities and coupon-clipping, computer book-entry transfer<br>
and institutional delivery services. The Depository Trust Company is a limited<br>
purpose trust company organized under the Banking Law of the State of New York,<br>
a member of the Federal Reserve System and a clearing agency registered under<br>
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.<br>
 <br>
 B-14<br>
 <br>
LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY<br>
 <br>
 The Trustee shall not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation<br>
or loss incurred by reason of the disposition of any moneys, Securities or in<br>
respect of any evaluation or for any action taken in good faith reliance on<br>
prima facie properly executed documents except in cases of willful misfeasance,<br>
bad faith, negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations and duties. In<br>
addition, the Indenture provides that the Trustee shall not be personally liable<br>
for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or in respect of the<br>
Trust which the Trustee may be required to pay under current or future laws of<br>
the United States or any other taxing authority having jurisdiction.<br>
 <br>
RESPONSIBILITY<br>
 <br>
 The Trustee shall not be liable for any default, failure or defect in any<br>
Security or for any depreciation or loss by reason of any such sale of<br>
Securities or by reason of the failure of the Sponsor to give directions to the<br>
Trustee.<br>
 <br>
 Additionally, the Trustee may sell Securities designated by the Sponsor, or<br>
if not so directed, in its own discretion, for the purpose of redeeming Units<br>
tendered for redemption.<br>
 <br>
 Amounts received by the Trust upon the sale of any Security under the<br>
conditions set forth above will be deposited in the Principal Account when<br>
received and to the extent not used for the redemption of Units will be<br>
distributable by the Trustee to Unit Holders of record on the Record Date next<br>
prior to a Distribution Date.<br>
 <br>
 For information relating to the responsibilities of the Trustee under the<br>
Indenture, reference is also made to the material set forth under &#x27;Rights of<br>
Unit Holders&#x27; and &#x27;Sponsor--Resignation.&#x27;<br>
 <br>
RESIGNATION<br>
 <br>
 By executing an instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor,<br>
the Trustee and any successor may resign. In such an event the Sponsor is<br>
obligated to appoint a successor trustee as soon as possible. If the Trustee<br>
becomes incapable of acting or becomes bankrupt or its affairs are taken over by<br>
public authorities, the Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor<br>
as provided in the Indenture. The Sponsor may also remove the Trustee if it<br>
determines (i) that a material deterioration in the creditworthiness of the<br>
Trustee or (ii) one or more negligent acts on the part of the Trustee having a<br>
materially adverse effect has occurred such that replacement of the Trustee is<br>
in the best interest of the Unit Holders. Such resignation or removal shall<br>
become effective upon the acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee. If<br>
upon resignation of a trustee no successor has been appointed and has accepted<br>
the appointment within thirty days after notification, the retiring trustee may<br>
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.<br>
The resignation or removal of a trustee becomes effective only when the<br>
successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court of competent<br>
jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. A successor trustee has the same<br>
rights and duties as the original trustee except to the extent, if any, that the<br>
Indenture is modified as permitted by its terms.<br>
 <br>
 AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE INDENTURE<br>
 <br>
AMENDMENT<br>
 <br>
 The Indenture may be amended by the Trustee and the Sponsor without the<br>
consent of Unit Holders (a) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement<br>
any provision thereof which may be defective or inconsistent, (b) to change any<br>
provision thereof as may be required by the Securities and Exchange Commission<br>
or any successor governmental agency, and (c) to make such other provisions as<br>
shall not adversely affect the interest of the Unit Holders; provided that the<br>
Indenture may also be amended by the Sponsor and the Trustee (or the performance<br>
of any of the provisions of the Indenture may be waived) with the consent of<br>
Unit Holders evidencing 51% of the Units at the time outstanding for the<br>
purposes of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating<br>
any of the provisions of the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights<br>
of Unit Holders. In no event shall the Indenture be amended so as to increase<br>
the number of Units issuable thereunder except as the result of the additional<br>
deposits of Securities, to permit the deposit of Securities after the Date of<br>
Deposit except in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indenture as<br>
initially adopted, to permit any other acquisition of securities or other<br>
property by the Trustee either in addition to or in substitution for any of the<br>
Securities on hand in the Trust or to permit the Trustee to vary the investment<br>
of the Unit Holders or to empower the Trustee to engage in business or to engage<br>
in investment activities not specifically authorized in the Indenture as<br>
originally adopted; or so as to adversely affect the characterization of the<br>
Trust as a grantor trust for Federal income tax purposes. In the event of any<br>
amendment requiring the consent of Unit Holders, the Trustee is obligated to<br>
promptly notify all Unit Holders of the substance of such amendment.<br>
 <br>
 B-15<br>
 <br>
TERMINATION<br>
 <br>
 The Trust may be terminated at any time by the consent of the holders of<br>
51% of the Units or by the Trustee upon the direction of the Sponsor when the<br>
aggregate net value of all Trust assets is less than 40% of the Securities<br>
deposited in the Trust on the Date of Deposit and subsequent thereto. However,<br>
in no event may the Trust continue beyond the Termination Date set forth under<br>
&#x27;Summary of Essential Information&#x27; in Part A. In the event of termination,<br>
written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to all Unit Holders.<br>
 <br>
 Section 17(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 restricts purchases and<br>
sales between affiliates of registered investment companies and those companies.<br>
Pursuant to a recent exemptive order, each terminating Low Five Portfolio Series<br>
can sell securities to the next Series if those securities continue to be<br>
included in the Low Five by remaining among the five lowest dollar priced stocks<br>
of the ten highest dividend-yielding securities in the DJIA. The exemption will<br>
enable each Series to eliminate commission costs on these transactions. The<br>
price for those securities will be the closing sale price on the sale date on<br>
the exchange where the securities are principally traded, as certified and<br>
confirmed by the Trustee of each Series.<br>
 <br>
 LEGAL OPINIONS<br>
 <br>
 Certain legal matters in connection with the Units offered hereby have been<br>
passed upon by Messrs. Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel, a partnership including a<br>
