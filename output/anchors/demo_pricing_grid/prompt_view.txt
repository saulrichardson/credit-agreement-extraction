⟦s000140⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Presentation of financial information Smith Douglas Holdings LLC is the accounting predecessor of Smith Douglas Homes Corp. for financial reporting purposes.
⟦s000141⟧ Smith Douglas Homes Corp. will be the audited financial reporting entity following this offering.
⟦s000142⟧ Accordingly, this prospectus contains the following historical financial statements: • Smith Douglas Homes Corp. Other than the inception balance sheet, dated as of June 20, 2023 and the interim financial statements as of September 30, 2023, the historical financial information of Smith Douglas Homes Corp. has not been included in this prospectus as it is a newly incorporated entity, has had no business transactions or activities to date, besides our initial capitalization.
⟦s000143⟧ • Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s000144⟧ Because Smith Douglas Homes Corp. will have no interest in any operations other than those of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, the historical financial information included in this prospectus is that of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s000145⟧ Certain monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included in this prospectus have been subject to rounding adjustments.
⟦s000146⟧ Percentage amounts included in this prospectus have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures, but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding.
⟦s000147⟧ For this reason, percentage amounts in this prospectus may vary from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.
⟦s000148⟧ Certain other amounts that appear in this prospectus may not sum due to rounding.
⟦s000149⟧ Key terms and performance indicators used in this prospectus; non-GAAP financial measures Throughout this prospectus, we use a number of key terms and provide a number of key performance indicators and non-GAAP financial measures used by management.
⟦s000150⟧ Please see “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Key metrics and non-GAAP financial measures” for definitions and further information about why and how we calculate key performance indicators and non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of the following: • adjusted home closing gross profit, defined as home closing revenue less cost of home closings, excluding capitalized interest charged to cost of home closings, impairment charges and adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting included in cost of sales, if applicable; • adjusted home closing gross margin, defined as adjusted home closing gross profit as a percentage of home closing revenue; • adjusted net income, defined as net income adjusted for the income tax expense effect of the pass-through entity taxable income of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC as if Smith Douglas Holdings LLC was a subchapter C corporation in periods presented.
⟦s000151⟧ This assumption uses an effective tax rate of 25% for pass-through taxable income, which is our anticipated federal and state blended tax rate as a public company; • EBITDA, defined as net income before (i) interest income, (ii) capitalized interest charged to cost of home closings, (iii) interest expense, (iv) income tax expense, and (v) depreciation; and • EBITDA margin, defined as EBITDA as a percentage of home closing revenue.
⟦s000152⟧ We use non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted home closing gross profit, adjusted home closing gross margin, adjusted net income, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin, to supplement financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.
⟦s000153⟧ S.
⟦s000154⟧ (“GAAP”).
⟦s000155⟧ We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance, as applicable, as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures.
⟦s000156⟧ Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide our stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results and make more meaningful period to period comparisons.
⟦s000157⟧ There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this prospectus.
⟦s000158⟧ For example, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
⟦s000159⟧ Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
⟦s000160⟧ See “Prospectus summary—Summary historical and pro forma condensed consolidated financial and other data” and “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

⟦s000188⟧ See “Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements.
⟦s000189⟧ ” Our company We are one of the nation’s fastest growing private homebuilders by number of closings and are engaged in the design, construction, and sale of single-family homes in some of the highest growth and most desirable markets in the Southeastern and Southern United States.
⟦s000190⟧ We employ an efficient land-light, production focused, and conservatively leveraged business model, which we believe results in a compelling combination of strong home closing gross margins, construction cycle times, and returns.
⟦s000191⟧ Our communities are primarily targeted to entry-level and empty-nest homebuyers.
⟦s000192⟧ We offer our homebuyers an attractive value proposition by providing a personalized home buying experience at affordable price points.
⟦s000193⟧ With the goal of becoming one of the most dominant homebuilders in the Southeastern and Southern United States, we intend to grow operations within our existing footprint and to expand into new markets where we can most effectively implement our business strategy and maximize our profit and returns.
⟦s000194⟧ Pursuant to our land-light business model, we typically purchase finished lots through lot-option contracts from third-party land developers or land bankers.
⟦s000195⟧ Our lot acquisition strategy reduces our up-front capital requirements and generally provides for “just-in-time” lot delivery, which closely aligns with our pace of home orders and home starts.
⟦s000196⟧ We believe our lot acquisition strategy reduces our operating and financial risk relative to other homebuilders that own a higher percentage of their land supply on balance sheet.
⟦s000197⟧ As of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 96% of our unstarted controlled lots were controlled through finished lot option contracts.
⟦s000198⟧ Our strategy and focus on capital efficiency has delivered strong risk-adjusted returns, as evidenced by our adjusted return on equity and adjusted return on inventory of 63% and 57%, respectively, for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, excluding our Houston segment acquired pursuant to the Devon Street Homes Acquisition, and of 81% and 75%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022.
⟦s000199⟧ We are a disciplined, process driven, and schedule-oriented company.
⟦s000200⟧ We utilize a single database ERP system called SMART Builder (that we nonexclusively license from an entity affiliated with the Founder Fund) that is fully integrated with our homebuilding operations.
⟦s000201⟧ Through SMART Builder, we manage all aspects of our construction process and work-flow scheduling in real-time, enhancing our operating efficiency and helping us generate higher returns for our stockholders.
⟦s000202⟧ Additionally, we approach our homebuilding operations through a partnership-oriented and relationship-based process called Rteam.
⟦s000203⟧ The key tenet of Rteam is to enhance the collaboration, visibility, and mutual accountability between us and our key business partners, including the developers, suppliers, and trade partners within our production model.
⟦s000204⟧ The Rteam process is the foundation of our operational success and the key driver of our current strong construction cycle times of approximately 64 business days and high inventory turnover rate of 3.
⟦s000205⟧ 8x for the year ended December 31, 2022.
⟦s000206⟧ The combination of our production efficiency and real-time construction management capabilities allows us to generate strong home closing gross margins, which were 29% for both the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022.
⟦s000207⟧ We pride ourselves on offering our homebuyers a personalized, affordable luxury buying experience at attractive prices.
⟦s000208⟧ For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our ASP of homes closed was approximately $333,000, providing an attractive price point for our target homebuyers with starting base prices below Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) loan limits.
⟦s000209⟧ We construct most of our homes on a pre-sold basis, where our homebuyers choose their homes based on a select number of value-engineered floor plans and are offered flexibility on the selection of home options.
⟦s000210⟧ The SMART Builder system and Rteam process allows this optionality for homebuyers based on just-in-time modifications.
⟦s000211⟧ As a result of our differentiated value proposition and efficient construction cycle times, we believe we typically achieve a high level of homebuyer satisfaction and experience low cancellation rates, which were 9% and 11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively.

⟦s000215⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Our geographic footprint is concentrated in markets that demonstrate strong population and employment growth trends, favorable migration patterns, and desirable lifestyle and weather conditions.
⟦s000216⟧ Our operations are currently organized into six geographical segments; our reportable segments include Atlanta (which includes certain Atlanta suburbs like Dalton, GA), Raleigh, Charlotte, Nashville, Alabama (which consists of both Birmingham and Huntsville), and Houston.
⟦s000217⟧ Each of our markets is experiencing strong momentum in housing demand drivers relative to historic averages, and we believe there is significant opportunity to expand our presence in each of our respective markets.
⟦s000218⟧ We intend to utilize proceeds from this offering to continue the expansion of our communities and the overall growth of our platform.
⟦s000219⟧ We have demonstrated significant growth since our inception in 2008, joining the Builder Magazine Top 100 list as the 83 rd largest builder based on number of closings in 2014 and have grown to be ranked as the 38 th largest builder for closings in 2022.
⟦s000220⟧ Additionally, based off of the Builder Magazine Top 100 list, we believe we are the second largest private builder founded after 2007 and sixth largest builder overall founded after 2007, each based on 2022 home closings.
⟦s000221⟧ During the year ended December 31, 2022, we closed 2,200 homes as compared to 526 homes in the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 23% CAGR over the last seven years.
⟦s000222⟧ In the same period, our revenue grew at a 32% CAGR from $109.
⟦s000223⟧ 3 million to $755.
⟦s000224⟧ 4 million.
⟦s000225⟧ Our history Our founder and Executive Chairman, Tom Bradbury, has almost 50 years of experience in the homebuilding industry.
⟦s000226⟧ Before founding Smith Douglas Homes, Mr. Bradbury founded Colony Homes in 1975, and built it into one of the largest and most recognized homebuilders in the Southeastern United States in the 1990s and early 2000s.
⟦s000227⟧ Our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Vice Chairman, Greg Bennett, worked alongside Mr. Bradbury at Colony Homes as Region President, where he helped drive the growth of the company.
⟦s000228⟧ While running Colony Homes, Mr. Bradbury and Mr. Bennett developed and refined the disciplined operating philosophy and integrated ERP system (SMART Builder) that we nonexclusively license for use today.
⟦s000229⟧ Like Smith Douglas Homes, Colony Homes catered to the entry-level homebuyer segment, and it had peak closings of over 2,200 homes in 2001 before its eventual sale to KB Home in 2003.
⟦s000230⟧ In 2008, in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, Mr. Bradbury saw a unique opportunity to re-enter the homebuilding industry, creating Smith Douglas Homes and breaking ground on its first home in Atlanta, Georgia.
⟦s000231⟧ In 2014, we surpassed 500 cumulative closings in Atlanta and began to establish our regional presence with an organic expansion into the Raleigh market followed by Birmingham in 2016, and Charlotte and Nashville in 2017.
⟦s000232⟧ In 2017, across all our existing markets, we delivered over 1,000 homes and generated approximately $240.
⟦s000233⟧ 3 million of home closing revenue.
⟦s000234⟧ In 2020, we continued to scale within our markets, completing over 900 annual home closings in Atlanta while also closing on over 200 homes in each of our other markets.
⟦s000235⟧ In addition, in that year we continued our organic expansion by entering the Huntsville market.
⟦s000236⟧ In 2023, we were ranked the second largest private builder by 2022 closings by the Atlanta Real Estate Forum, and in 2022 Atlanta became our first market to account for over 1,000 home closings in a calendar year.
⟦s000237⟧ During the year ended December 31, 2022, we closed 2,200 homes across all our markets while surpassing 10,000 cumulative home closings.
⟦s000238⟧ As part of the next phase of our growth, we intend to expand operations within the Southern United States.
⟦s000239⟧ On July 31, 2023, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Devon Street Homes, a high-quality regional homebuilder based in Houston, Texas that closed 324 homes in 2022.
⟦s000240⟧ We believe the acquisition of Devon Street Homes will create a launching point for our company within the Texas market and will allow us to pursue expansion opportunities across the Southern United States.

⟦s000254⟧ housing market is proving to be resilient, driven by favorable supply and demand characteristics.
⟦s000255⟧ The strong demand for housing during the pandemic, aided by above-average household formation, began to slow as mortgage rates rose in response to high levels of inflation.
⟦s000256⟧ The demand for housing in the Southeast and Texas accelerated during the pandemic, with strong in-migration to these regions partially attributable to work-from-home opportunities.
⟦s000257⟧ According to the U.

⟦s000260⟧ 4% below the 1980-2019 average.
⟦s000261⟧ The employment sector remains solid, recovering all jobs lost during the early months of the pandemic, and continuing to show year-over-year growth.
⟦s000262⟧ A lack of available housing supply and affordability challenges brought on by rising prices and mortgage rates led to seasonally adjusted new home sales declining to 714,000 transactions in the year ended July 2023, according to the U.

⟦s000268⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS For the existing home market, the national affordability is significantly worse than the historical normal level, owing to the level of increase in home prices since the beginning of the pandemic and the more-recent increase in mortgage rates.

⟦s000270⟧ Nationally, for-sale housing is overpriced by approximately 36%, with housing costs comprising nearly 44% of incomes as of July 2023, well above a more normal ratio of 31%.
⟦s000271⟧ Supply of listed existing homes for the year ended July 2023 totaled just over three months.
⟦s000272⟧ While this near-record-low level has likely been affected by greater efficiencies in the resale process, it is still a low number compared to the 1983-2019 average of 6.

⟦s000408⟧ We believe the following strengths create a significant competitive advantage as we execute upon our business strategy and pursue future growth.
⟦s000409⟧ Efficient, schedule driven manufacturing platform that drives strong construction cycle times and robust home closing gross margins We maintain a highly efficient homebuilding production model which results in robust home closing gross margins and profitability.
⟦s000410⟧ We achieved home closing gross margins of 29% for both the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022, which were among the highest in the public homebuilding sector, and also currently average a construction cycle time of approximately 64 business days.
⟦s000411⟧ We achieve economies of scale across our production model by offering a consistent set of core floor plan options across all our markets.
⟦s000412⟧ For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, for example, over 93% of our closings were derived from fewer than 30 floor plans.
⟦s000413⟧ We also seek to further improve our production efficiencies through the continuity of the trade partner construction teams we utilize across multiple job sites.
⟦s000414⟧ This continuity increases trade partner familiarity with our floor plans and building materials, which in turn increases productivity and allows us to target a minimum of one home start a day per Rteam.
⟦s000415⟧ We believe our Rteam philosophy is the foundation of our operational success and places significant focus on accountability and collaboration, emphasizing a mindset of shared success whereby each partner's contribution is critical to the success of everyone else and the overall success of a project.
⟦s000416⟧ To further facilitate our efficient homebuilding operations, we utilize an ERP system, SMART Builder, which is a real-time, schedule driven, single database that manages our entire homebuilding construction ecosystem, including sales, purchasing, scheduling, production, accounting, and servicing.
⟦s000417⟧ The combination of all of the above factors allows us to operate efficiently and ultimately supports our ability to drive our low cycle times, high inventory turnover and strong margins and returns.
⟦s000418⟧ Land-light business model that allows for both risk mitigation and enhanced returns Core to our success is the capital efficient, land-light operating strategy we have employed since our inception.
⟦s000419⟧ We believe this approach mitigates risk and, consistent with our efficiency focused culture, enhances our returns.
⟦s000420⟧ We primarily acquire finished lots from reputable third-party land developers and land bankers through lot-option contracts, thereby avoiding the financial requirements and risks associated with land ownership and land development.
⟦s000421⟧ Our primary obligation and potential economic risk for failure to perform under our lot-option contracts is typically 6
⟦s000422⟧ End Page 18
⟦s000423⟧ Begin Page 19
⟦s000424⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS limited to the amount of our deposit.
⟦s000425⟧ Additionally, we aim to limit our balance sheet risk by typically keeping less than two months of finished lots on our balance sheet at any given time.
⟦s000426⟧ By utilizing a “just-in-time” approach to lot acquisitions, we reduce our up-front capital commitments and in turn drive higher inventory turnover and returns.
⟦s000427⟧ As of September 30, 2023, we controlled 10,279 lots through option contracts, representing 96% of our total unstarted controlled lots, compared to an average of 49% for public company homebuilders.
⟦s000428⟧ Our inventory turnover was 3.
⟦s000429⟧ 0x for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, excluding our Houston segment acquired pursuant to the Devon Street Homes Acquisition, and 3.
⟦s000430⟧ 8x for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to an average inventory turnover of 1.
⟦s000431⟧ 2x and 1.
⟦s000432⟧ 3x, respectively, for the same periods, for public company homebuilders.
⟦s000433⟧ Our adjusted return on equity and adjusted return on inventory was 63% and 57%, respectively, for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, excluding our Houston segment acquired pursuant to the Devon Street Homes Acquisition, and 81% and 75%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the averages of 21% and 18%, respectively, for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, and 28% and 24%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022, for public company homebuilders.
⟦s000434⟧ Established presence in attractive, high growth markets We are focused on favorable, high growth housing markets primarily in the Southeastern and Southern United States.
⟦s000435⟧ Since establishing our initial presence in Atlanta, we have steadily expanded our footprint into Raleigh, Birmingham, Charlotte, Nashville, Huntsville, and Houston over the last nine years.
⟦s000436⟧ Our markets exhibit attractive demographic trends, including high employment growth, strong supply and demand fundamentals, positive net migration, home price appreciation, favorable land pricing, and low costs of living, which we believe will support the long-term growth of new home orders.
⟦s000437⟧ According to JBREC, the majority of our markets rank among the top ten in the Southeast for positive net migration over the last year.
⟦s000438⟧ We believe the combination of these compelling trends and our strong presence within these markets will help facilitate the execution of our growth strategy.
⟦s000439⟧ Scalable platform well positioned to expand in existing and new markets Since our inception in 2008, we have expanded our homebuilding operations through consistent organic growth.
⟦s000440⟧ We utilize our management team’s deep industry knowledge, disciplined underwriting and project management capabilities, and our scalable, process-driven, schedule-oriented platform to grow in submarkets within our existing footprint as well as enter new markets.
⟦s000441⟧ In Atlanta, we have rapidly and profitably grown our presence, celebrating our 5,000 th cumulative closing in 2020.
⟦s000442⟧ We have successfully scaled our business while maintaining strong margins by targeting markets where we can replicate our land-light strategy and Rteam production model, and also leverage our strong relationships with local developers, suppliers, and municipalities to grow communities.
⟦s000443⟧ For the year ended December 31, 2022, we closed 2,200 homes, achieving a 23% CAGR on closed homes from 2015 to 2022.
⟦s000444⟧ Among homebuilders that began operations after 2007, based off of the Builder Magazine Top 100 list, we believe we are the sixth largest homebuilder in the country and the second largest private builder, each based on number of 2022 home closings, which further highlights our platform’s ability to scale.
⟦s000445⟧ Going forward, we intend to apply our management team’s strong execution capabilities to capitalize on growth opportunities within our existing markets and new markets.

⟦s000449⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Differentiated ability to offer a personalized homebuying experience to price-conscious homebuyers Through our efficient and differentiated operating approach, we have the ability to offer our target homebuyers a personalized affordable luxury buying experience.
⟦s000450⟧ As part of our home offerings, we provide homebuyers a wide range of value engineered exterior and interior options.
⟦s000451⟧ Additionally, because we offer a consistent, optimized set of floor plans and home options across our markets, we can reduce costs, shorten construction cycle times, and ultimately deliver a high-quality personalized home at an attractive price point, which averaged approximately $333,000 on homes closed during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
⟦s000452⟧ Combined, our compelling value, high level of personalization, and superior home construction times have resulted in one of the lowest cancellation rates amongst all the public company homebuilders, which were 9% and 11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, meaningfully below public company homebuilders’ average of 15% and 21%, respectively, for the same periods.
⟦s000453⟧ We believe our ability to offer a personalized buying experience at an affordable price point will continue to create meaningful differentiation in the market for us.
⟦s000454⟧ Veteran management team with track record of success and significant public company experience We benefit from a seasoned management team with a long history of generating consistent positive financial results and strong returns for stockholders.
⟦s000455⟧ Our management team averages over 25 years of industry experience, with many of our executives and upper management having previously held senior roles at other public homebuilder companies, including KB Home, WCI Communities, Beazer Homes, Meritage Homes, Pulte, and NVR.
⟦s000456⟧ Our founder and Executive Chairman, Tom Bradbury, is a long-time industry veteran who previously founded Colony Homes.
⟦s000457⟧ Under his leadership, Colony Homes grew into one of the largest homebuilders in the Southeastern United States focused on entry-level homebuyers and was ultimately sold to KB Home in 2003.
⟦s000458⟧ Our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Vice Chairman, Greg Bennett, has spent most of his career working alongside Mr. Bradbury, starting in 1986 and through his last position as Region President of Colony Homes prior to its sale to KB Home.
⟦s000459⟧ In 2004, Greg founded his own homebuilding company, Greg Bennett Homes, which he operated until he joined Smith Douglas Homes in 2015.
⟦s000460⟧ Our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Russell Devendorf, has previously served as Chief Financial Officer at WCI Communities, where he helped spearhead the restructuring and turnaround of the company from 2008 to its successful initial public offering in 2013 and its eventual sale to Lennar in 2017.
⟦s000461⟧ Our management’s experience adds a level of expertise, governance, and accountability that we believe is distinct for companies of our size.
⟦s000462⟧ After the consummation of this offering, in the aggregate, management will continue to own 85.
⟦s000463⟧ 0% of outstanding common stock, assuming no exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, creating long-term alignment of interests between management and stockholders.
⟦s000464⟧ Conservative balance sheet and liquidity, with substantial capacity to drive growth We maintain a conservatively leveraged and flexible balance sheet which reflects our efficiency-minded operating philosophy.
⟦s000465⟧ As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, our debt-to-book capitalization was 29% and 8%, and our net-debt-to-net book capitalization was 26% and (10)%.

⟦s000471⟧ 0 million of undrawn capacity under the Existing Credit Facility (exclusive of outstanding letters of credit) as of September 30, 2023.
⟦s000472⟧ Following this transaction, we believe our enhanced liquidity position will allow us to react nimbly to market conditions and to pursue attractive organic growth or acquisition opportunities.
⟦s000473⟧ Our strategy We expect to execute on the strategies below to establish our legacy as one of the country’s leading homebuilders and to continue driving consistent growth, operating efficiency, and strong returns while delivering high-quality, personalized homes to homebuyers at affordable price points.
⟦s000474⟧ Through the execution of our business strategy, we will strive to expand our platform and become a top homebuilder in the United States.
⟦s000475⟧ Capitalize on our land-light capital strategy to efficiently build new communities and drive superior risk-adjusted returns We intend to continue our land-light lot acquisition strategy to support future growth while maintaining strong equity returns.
⟦s000476⟧ We believe this approach, combined with our primarily pre-selling / build-to-order strategy, allows us to efficiently build new communities while also limiting our operational and financial risk during various economic cycles.
⟦s000477⟧ Without the financial and operational risks of undeveloped land ownership, we create an even flow of lot purchases, better aligning the pace of home orders and home starts.
⟦s000478⟧ Furthermore, to drive greater inventory turnover, we utilize financial incentive structures within our market divisions to target no more than approximately two months of finished lots and four months of started lots at any given time.
⟦s000479⟧ We have utilized the land-light business model since our inception in 2008 and have forged strong relationships with land developers and land bankers that span multiple markets, which we believe give us an advantage when sourcing and executing lot option contracts.
⟦s000480⟧ Supported by these enduring relationships, we believe our land-light strategy differentiates us from peers and allows us to consistently achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns.
⟦s000481⟧ Increase presence and market share within our existing markets Our focused strategy of targeting entry-level and empty-nest homebuyers in our preferred markets has been at the core of our historical expansion and these homebuyer groups will continue to be our primary target demographic.
⟦s000482⟧ We leverage our strong relationships with local developers, suppliers, municipalities, and land bankers to give us deeper access in our existing markets to increase land positions and community count.
⟦s000483⟧ We have experienced rapid organic growth since our inception in 2008, expanding our geographic presence from our headquarters in Atlanta, a market where we are currently one of the largest homebuilders, to six additional key markets with robust growth outlooks: Raleigh, Charlotte, Birmingham, Houston, Huntsville, and Nashville.
⟦s000484⟧ We believe there remains significant opportunity to increase market share and meaningfully grow within our existing markets, driving economies of scale and overall platform growth.
⟦s000485⟧ Opportunistically expand to new markets We see attractive growth opportunities, particularly in the Southeastern and Southern United States, and intend to opportunistically expand into new geographies through organic growth and platform acquisitions.
⟦s000486⟧ We evaluate potential market expansion opportunities using a set of robust strategic market criteria, including availability of land and unmet demand in suburban-plus areas, as well as the ability to pursue a similar lot option strategy, house plans, and construction process while leveraging our Rteam philosophy.
⟦s000487⟧ As part of our new market expansion strategy, we target establishing critical scale of at least 200 annual starts within the first two years of entering a new market in order to maximize our Rteam efficiency.
⟦s000488⟧ Furthermore, we will selectively evaluate external growth opportunities where we can accretively gain scale in a market and enhance our position for future growth.
⟦s000489⟧ For example, our acquisition of Devon Street Homes has helped us enter the highly attractive Houston market, providing us immediate scale and positioning us to grow organically in neighboring Texas markets over time.
⟦s000490⟧ Looking ahead, we will continue to pursue attractive market expansion opportunities that align with our strategy.
⟦s000491⟧ Continue to target our key entry-level and empty-nest homebuyer demographics Our strategy is to target the entry-level and empty-nest demographics in the Southeastern and Southern regions of the U.
⟦s000492⟧ S.
⟦s000493⟧ We believe the fundamental drivers at both the national level and, more specifically, in our local markets have created an increased demand for entry-level priced homes, which we believe makes us well positioned to fulfill this 9
⟦s000494⟧ End Page 21
⟦s000495⟧ Begin Page 22
⟦s000496⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS demand as a result of our ASP of homes closed, which was approximately $333,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and one of the lowest among public company homebuilders.
⟦s000497⟧ According to a 2023 National Association of Home Builders (“NAHB”) housing affordability analysis, 73% of households cannot afford a median-priced single-family home (which was equal to $418,000 in 2022).
⟦s000498⟧ By targeting lower price point offerings, we are able to drive demand despite broader affordability concerns.
⟦s000499⟧ We operate in attractive market segments, where there is consistent demand for homes as homebuyers look for alternatives to renting, especially with rising rental rates.
⟦s000500⟧ We believe homebuyers appreciate our value proposition created by the combination of our home affordability and the level of personalization we provide.
⟦s000501⟧ Furthermore, in the current environment, the recent rise in interest rates has created a significant affordability problem, making our price points even more attractive.
⟦s000502⟧ In addition, we have significant experience working across multiple mortgage types including, but not limited to, FHA, USDA, and conventional mortgages, which allows us to offer financing support tailored to the needs of our homebuyers.
⟦s000503⟧ Focus on delivering a personalized build-to-order experience at attractive price points We believe a key differentiator of our business is how we redefine affordable luxury for the homebuilding sector.
⟦s000504⟧ Our home offerings address the strong market demand for an affordable luxury experience that provides homebuyer personalization, through an a-la-carte approach to various home design options, without sacrificing affordability.
⟦s000505⟧ Our unique affordable luxury business model is designed to balance an optimized and value-driven homebuyer experience with operational efficiency.
⟦s000506⟧ We have invested significant resources in perfecting approximately 30 value-engineered floor plans that our homebuyers have used in over 93% of total homes closed across all our markets for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
⟦s000507⟧ The streamlined floor plans and strong scheduling adherence allow us to offer high-quality homes at affordable prices with short turnaround times.
⟦s000508⟧ Going forward, we will continue to provide a select variety of home layout options and amenities for our homebuyers in a streamlined and cost-effective manner.
⟦s000509⟧ Lastly, we also consider our homebuyers’ living experience after buying a home in one of our communities, so we have structured our lot and land acquisition strategy to maximize streetscapes and create an efficient community layout.
⟦s000510⟧ We believe this compelling value proposition provides meaningful differentiation in the market, increasing the demand for our homes relative to our competitors, who do not offer the same level of personalization and value at comparable price points.
⟦s000511⟧ With our approach to offering affordable luxury in the homebuilding space, we intend to continue to expand our brand to reach more homebuyers with our unique value proposition.
⟦s000512⟧ Continue to utilize strong cash flow generation to grow platform and drive high return on equity We operate a highly efficient business model that has consistently generated strong margins and significant cash flow.
⟦s000513⟧ Our margin and cash flow profile has historically enabled us to simultaneously expand our business, maintain a conservative, durable balance sheet, and return capital to stockholders, which has in turn resulted in strong equity returns.
⟦s000514⟧ We intend to continue utilizing a nimble and balanced capital allocation strategy that prioritizes the growth of our platform, increased profitability, and the strength of our balance sheet while targeting a consistent, high return on equity for our stockholders.
⟦s000515⟧ This allows us to maintain long-term balance sheet durability to withstand multiple cycles and to execute operational and acquisition strategies when access to capital is scarce.
⟦s000516⟧ We believe this offering will diversify our access to capital and enhance our already strong liquidity position, further supporting our robust future growth plans and providing us with the flexibility to opportunistically deploy capital.
⟦s000517⟧ We plan to continue to be prudent with our use of leverage, which we believe is key to the long-term growth and financial stability of our business.
⟦s000518⟧ Recent developments Estimated preliminary operational results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 We are currently in the process of finalizing our consolidated financial results for our fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and, therefore, our actual results for these periods are not yet available and have not been audited.

⟦s000591⟧ Upon the occurrence of the Sunset Date, each share of Class B common stock will then be entitled to one vote per share.
⟦s000592⟧ This high/low vote structure will enable the Continuing Equity Owners to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our directors, as well as the overall management and direction of our company.
⟦s000593⟧ Furthermore, the Continuing Equity Owners will continue to exert a significant degree of influence, or actual control, over matters requiring stockholder approval.
⟦s000594⟧ We believe that maintaining this control by the Continuing Equity Owners will help enable them to successfully guide the implementation of our Company’s growth strategies and strategic vision.
⟦s000595⟧ Meanwhile, holders of our Class A common stock will have economic and voting rights similar to those of holders of common stock of non-Up-C structured public companies that have a high/low vote structure.
⟦s000596⟧ See “Description of capital stock.
⟦s000597⟧ ” As the sole managing member of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, we will operate and control all of the business and affairs of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and, through Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, conduct our business.
⟦s000598⟧ Following the Transactions, including this offering, Smith Douglas Homes Corp. will control the management of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC as its sole managing member.
⟦s000599⟧ As a result, Smith Douglas Homes Corp. will consolidate Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and record a significant non-controlling interest in a consolidated entity in Smith Douglas Homes Corp.’s consolidated financial statements for the economic interest in Smith Douglas Holdings LLC held by the Continuing Equity Owners.

⟦s000603⟧ ” Our corporate structure following this offering, as described below, is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership-C corporation (“Up-C”) structure, which is often used by partnerships and limited liability companies when they undertake an initial public offering of their business.
⟦s000604⟧ The Up-C structure will allow the Continuing Equity Owners to retain their equity ownership in Smith Douglas Holdings LLC following the offering and to continue to realize tax benefits associated with owning interests in an entity that is treated as a partnership, or “flow-through” entity, for U.
⟦s000605⟧ S.

⟦s000607⟧ Investors in this offering will, by contrast, hold their equity ownership in Smith Douglas Homes Corp., a Delaware corporation that is a domestic corporation for U.
⟦s000608⟧ S.
⟦s000609⟧ federal income tax purposes, in the form of shares of Class A common stock.
⟦s000610⟧ One of the tax benefits to the Continuing Equity Owners associated with this structure is that future taxable income of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC that is allocated to the Continuing Equity Owners will be taxed on a flow-through basis and, therefore, will not be subject to corporate taxes at the entity level.
⟦s000611⟧ Additionally, because the Continuing Equity Owners may have their LLC Interests redeemed by Smith Douglas Holdings LLC (or at our option, directly exchanged by Smith Douglas Homes Corp.) for newly issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to customary adjustments, including for stock splits, stock dividends, and reclassifications) or, at our option, for cash, the Up-C structure also provides the Continuing Equity Owners with potential liquidity that holders of non-publicly traded limited liability companies are not typically afforded.
⟦s000612⟧ In connection with any such redemption or exchange of LLC Interests, a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock held by the relevant Continuing Equity Owner will automatically be transferred to Smith Douglas Homes Corp. for no consideration and be canceled.
⟦s000613⟧ The Continuing Equity Owners and Smith Douglas Homes Corp. also each expect to benefit from the Up-C structure as a result of certain cash tax savings arising from redemptions or exchanges of the Continuing Equity Owner’s LLC Interests for Class A common stock or cash, and certain other tax benefits covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement discussed in “Certain relationships and related person transactions—Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s000614⟧ ” See “Risk factors—Risks related to our organizational structure.

⟦s000636⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Implications of being an emerging growth company We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”).
⟦s000637⟧ An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies.
⟦s000638⟧ As a result: • we are required to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related selected financial data and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure; • we are not required to engage an auditor to report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”); • we are not required to comply with the requirement of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”), regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor’s report on the financial statements; • we are not required to submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency,” and “say-on-golden parachutes;” and • we are not required to comply with certain disclosure requirements related to executive compensation, such as the requirement to present a comparison of our Chief Executive Officer’s compensation to our median employee compensation.
⟦s000639⟧ We may take advantage of these reduced reporting and other requirements until such time that we are no longer an emerging growth company.
⟦s000640⟧ We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of this offering; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.

⟦s000642⟧ 0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year; or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.
⟦s000643⟧ 0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.

⟦s000645⟧ We have elected to adopt the reduced requirements with respect to our financial statements and the related selected financial data and “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” disclosure, including in this prospectus.
⟦s000646⟧ In addition, the JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company like us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies.
⟦s000647⟧ We have chosen to “opt out” of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are adopted.

⟦s000818⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Risk factors An investment in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk.
⟦s000819⟧ Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the specific risk factors set forth below, together with the other information included elsewhere in this prospectus.
⟦s000820⟧ If any of the risks discussed in this prospectus occur, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially impaired, in which case the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
⟦s000821⟧ Some statements in this prospectus, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements.
⟦s000822⟧ Please refer to the section entitled “Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements.
⟦s000823⟧ ” Risks related to our business, industry, and the economy Our industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions.
⟦s000824⟧ Our business can be substantially affected by adverse changes in general economic or business conditions, and other events and conditions that are outside of our control, including: • increases in short- and long-term interest rates; • high inflation; • supply-chain disruptions and the cost or availability of building materials; • the availability of trade partners, vendors, or other third parties; • housing affordability; • the availability and cost of financing for homebuyers; • federal and state income and real estate tax laws, including limitations on, or the elimination of, the deduction of mortgage interest or property tax payments; • employment levels, job and personal income growth and household debt-to-income levels; • consumer confidence generally and the confidence of potential homebuyers in particular; • the ability of homeowners to sell their existing homes at acceptable prices; • the U.
⟦s000825⟧ S.
⟦s000826⟧ and global financial systems and credit markets, including stock market and credit market volatility; • inclement weather and natural and man-made disasters, including risks associated with global climate change, such as increased frequency or intensity of adverse weather events; • environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, and the environmental conditions of our properties; • civil unrest, acts of terrorism, other acts of violence, threats to national security, global economic and political instability, and conflicts such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict (including any escalation or expansion), escalating global trade tensions, the adoption of trade restrictions, or a public health issue such as COVID-19 or another major epidemic or pandemic; • mortgage financing programs and regulation of lending practices; • housing demand from population growth, household formations and demographic changes (including immigration levels and trends or other costs of home ownership in urban and suburban migration); • demand from foreign homebuyers for our homes; • the supply of available new or existing homes and other housing alternatives; • energy prices; and • the supply of developable land in our markets and in the United States generally.
⟦s000827⟧ Adverse changes in these conditions may affect our business nationally or may be more prevalent or concentrated in particular regions or localities in which we operate or may decide to operate in the future, which effects may be magnified where we have significant operations.
⟦s000828⟧ Additionally, governmental action and legislation related to economic stimulus, taxation, tariffs, spending levels and borrowing limits, interest rates, immigration, as well as 27

⟦s000832⟧ S.
⟦s000833⟧ economy and the housing market.
⟦s000834⟧ Any deterioration or significant uncertainty in economic or political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
⟦s000835⟧ These adverse changes in economic and other conditions can cause mortgage rates to rise, demand and prices for our homes to diminish, or cause us to take longer to build our homes and make it more costly for us to do so.
⟦s000836⟧ We may not be able to recover these increased costs by raising prices because of weak market conditions and because the price of each home we sell is usually set several months before the home is delivered, as many homebuyers sign their home purchase contracts before construction begins.
⟦s000837⟧ The potential difficulties described above could impact our homebuyers’ ability to obtain suitable financing and cause some homebuyers to cancel their home purchase contracts altogether.
⟦s000838⟧ The housing market may not continue to grow at the same rate, or may decline, and any reduced growth or decline in our markets or for the homebuilding industry generally may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.
⟦s000839⟧ We cannot predict whether and to what extent the housing markets in the geographic areas in which we operate or may decide to operate in the future will continue to grow, particularly if interest rates for mortgage loans, land costs, and construction costs rise.
⟦s000840⟧ Other factors that might impact growth in the homebuilding industry include uncertainty in domestic and international financial, credit, and consumer lending markets amid slow economic growth or recessionary conditions in various regions or industries around the world, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, tight lending standards and practices for mortgage loans that limit consumers’ ability to qualify for mortgage financing to purchase a home, including increased minimum credit score requirements, credit risk/mortgage loan insurance premiums and/or other fees and required down payment amounts, higher home prices, more conservative appraisals, changing consumer preferences, higher loan-to-value ratios and extensive homebuyer income and asset documentation requirements, changes to mortgage regulations, population decline or slower rates of population growth in our markets, or Federal Reserve policy changes.
⟦s000841⟧ Given these factors, we can provide no assurance that the present housing market will continue to be strong, whether overall or in our markets.
⟦s000842⟧ Because we depend on a limited number of markets for substantially all of our home orders, if these markets, and in particular, Atlanta, Georgia, our largest market, experience downturns in the housing market, our business, prospects, and results of operations would be adversely impacted even if conditions in the broader economy or housing market did not suffer such a decline.
⟦s000843⟧ If there is limited economic growth, declines in employment and consumer income, changes in consumer behavior, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and/or tightening of mortgage lending standards, practices and regulation in the geographic areas in which we operate or may decide to operate in the future, or if interest rates for mortgage loans or home prices rise, there could likely be a corresponding adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, including, but not limited to, the number of homes we sell, our ASP of homes closed, and the amount of revenues or profits we generate, and such effect may be material.
⟦s000844⟧ The tightening of mortgage lending standards and mortgage financing requirements, untimely or incomplete mortgage loan originations, and rising mortgage interest rates could adversely affect the availability of mortgage loans for potential purchasers of our homes and thereby materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s000845⟧ Almost all our homebuyers finance their home purchases through lenders that provide mortgage financing.
⟦s000846⟧ Mortgage interest rates have generally trended downward for the last several decades and reached historic lows in 2021, which made the homes we sell more affordable during that period.
⟦s000847⟧ Mortgage interest rates increased substantially during 2022 and 2023 in response to the Federal Reserve’s actions and future signaling to combat inflationary pressures, which negatively impacted consumer affordability.
⟦s000848⟧ We cannot predict future mortgage interest rates, and if mortgage interest rates continue to increase, the ability of prospective homebuyers to finance home purchases may be adversely affected, and our operating results may be significantly impacted.
⟦s000849⟧ Our homebuilding activities are dependent upon the availability of mortgage financing to homebuyers, which is expected to be impacted by continued regulatory changes and fluctuations in the risk appetites of lenders.
⟦s000850⟧ The financial documentation, down payment amounts, and income to debt ratio requirements are subject to change and could become more restrictive.

⟦s000854⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS The federal government has a significant role in supporting mortgage lending through its conservatorship of Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), both of which purchase or insure mortgage loans and mortgage loan-backed securities, and its insurance of mortgage loans through or in connection with the FHA, the Veterans Administration (“VA”), and the U.
⟦s000855⟧ S.
⟦s000856⟧ Department of Agriculture (“USDA”).
⟦s000857⟧ FHA and VA backing of mortgage loans has been particularly important to the mortgage finance industry and to our business.
⟦s000858⟧ Increased lending volume and losses insured by the FHA have resulted in a reduction of the FHA insurance fund.
⟦s000859⟧ If either the FHA or VA raised their down payment requirements or lowered maximum loan amounts, our business could be materially affected.
⟦s000860⟧ In addition, changes in governmental regulation with respect to mortgage lenders could adversely affect demand for housing.
⟦s000861⟧ The availability and affordability of mortgage loans, including mortgage interest rates for such loans, could also be adversely affected by a scaling back or termination of the federal government’s mortgage loan-related programs or policies.
⟦s000862⟧ Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, USDA, and VA backed mortgage loans have been an important factor in marketing and selling many of our homes.
⟦s000863⟧ Given that a majority of our homebuyers’ mortgages conform with terms established by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, FHA, USDA, and VA, any limitations or restrictions in the availability of, or higher consumer costs for, such government-backed financing could adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s000864⟧ The elimination or curtailment of state bonds to assist homebuyers could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s000865⟧ In addition, certain current regulations impose, and future regulations may strengthen or impose, new standards and requirements relating to the origination, securitization, and servicing of residential consumer mortgage loans, which could further restrict the availability and affordability of mortgage loans and the demand for such loans by financial intermediaries and, as a result, adversely affect our home orders, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s000866⟧ Further, if, due to credit or consumer lending market conditions, reduced liquidity, increased risk retention or minimum capital level obligations and/or regulatory restrictions related to certain regulations, laws or other factors or business decisions, these lenders refuse or are unable to provide mortgage loans to our homebuyers, or increase the costs to borrowers to obtain such loans, the number of homes we close and our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
⟦s000867⟧ Price-conscious entry-level and empty-nest homebuyers are the primary sources of demand for our new homes.
⟦s000868⟧ Entry-level homebuyers are generally more affected by the availability of mortgage financing than other potential homebuyers and many of our potential empty-nest homebuyers must sell their existing homes to buy a home from us.
⟦s000869⟧ A limited availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent homebuyers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our homebuyers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete such purchases, either of which could result in potential homebuyers’ inability to buy a home from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, cash flows, and ability to service our debt obligations.
⟦s000870⟧ Regional factors affecting the homebuilding industry in our current and future markets could materially and adversely affect us.
⟦s000871⟧ Our business strategy is focused on the acquisition of suitable land and the design, construction, and sale of primarily single-family homes in residential subdivisions, including planned communities, in Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
⟦s000872⟧ In addition, we have land banking contracts for the right to purchase land or lots at a future point in time in all our current markets.
⟦s000873⟧ A prolonged economic downturn or future adverse conditions in one or more of these areas, or a particular industry that is fundamental to one or more of these areas, particularly within Atlanta, Georgia, our largest market, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s000874⟧ Furthermore, if homebuyer demand for new homes in these markets decreases, home prices could decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
⟦s000875⟧ Interest rate changes, and the failure to hedge against them, may adversely affect us.
⟦s000876⟧ We have in the past and may in the future borrow money to finance acquisitions related to land, lots, home inventories, or other companies.
⟦s000877⟧ The borrowings may bear interest at variable rates.
⟦s000878⟧ Interest rate changes could affect our interest payments, and our future earnings, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected, assuming other factors are held constant.

⟦s000882⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS We currently do not hedge against interest rate fluctuations.
⟦s000883⟧ We may in the future obtain one or more forms of interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements, interest rate cap contracts or similar agreements to hedge against the possible negative effects of interest rate fluctuations.
⟦s000884⟧ However, we cannot assure you that any hedging will adequately relieve the adverse effects of interest rate increases or that counterparties under these agreements will honor their obligations thereunder.
⟦s000885⟧ In addition, we may be subject to risks of default by hedging counterparties.
⟦s000886⟧ Adverse economic conditions could also cause the terms on which we borrow to be unfavorable.
⟦s000887⟧ We could be required to liquidate one or more of our assets at times which may not permit us to receive an attractive return on our assets in order to meet our debt service obligations.
⟦s000888⟧ The homebuilding industry is highly competitive and, if our competitors are more successful or offer better value to our homebuyers, our business could decline.
⟦s000889⟧ We operate in a very competitive environment that is characterized by competition from a number of other homebuilders in each market in which we operate.
⟦s000890⟧ Additionally, there are relatively low barriers to entry into our business.
⟦s000891⟧ We compete with large national and regional homebuilding companies, some of which have greater financial and operational resources than us, and with smaller local homebuilders, some of which may have lower administrative costs than us.
⟦s000892⟧ We may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to certain of our large national and regional homebuilding competitors whose operations are more geographically diversified than ours, as these competitors may be better able to withstand any future regional downturns in the housing market.
⟦s000893⟧ Furthermore, our market share in certain of our markets may be lower as compared to some of our competitors.
⟦s000894⟧ Many of our competitors also have longer operating histories and longstanding relationships with trade partners and suppliers in the markets in which we operate or to which we may expand.
⟦s000895⟧ This may give our competitors an advantage in marketing their products, securing lots, materials, and labor at lower prices, and allowing their homes to be delivered to homebuyers more quickly and at more favorable prices.
⟦s000896⟧ We compete for homebuyers, desirable lots and lot options, financing, raw materials, skilled management, and other labor resources, among other things.
⟦s000897⟧ Our competitors may independently develop land and construct homes that are substantially similar to our products.
⟦s000898⟧ Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring desirable lots and lot options on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion, and cause us to increase our selling incentives and reduce our prices.
⟦s000899⟧ An oversupply of homes available for sale or discounting of home prices by competitors could periodically adversely affect demand for our homes in certain markets and could adversely affect pricing for homes in the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future.
⟦s000900⟧ If we are unable to compete effectively in our markets, our business could decline disproportionately to our competitors, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
⟦s000901⟧ We can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in any of our markets.
⟦s000902⟧ Our inability to continue to compete successfully in any of our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s000903⟧ Fluctuations in real estate values may require us to write-down the book value of our real estate assets.
⟦s000904⟧ The homebuilding and land development industries are subject to significant variability and fluctuations in real estate values.
⟦s000905⟧ As a result, we may be required to write-down the book value of our real estate assets in accordance with GAAP, and some of those write-downs could be material.
⟦s000906⟧ Any material write-downs of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s000907⟧ Natural and man-made disasters, severe weather, and adverse geologic conditions may increase costs, cause project delays, and reduce consumer demand for housing, all of which could materially and adversely affect us.
⟦s000908⟧ Our homebuilding operations are in many areas that are subject to natural and man-made disasters, severe weather, or adverse geologic conditions.
⟦s000909⟧ These include, but are not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, brushfires, wildfires, prolonged periods of precipitation, landslides, soil subsidence, earthquakes, and other natural and man-made disasters.
⟦s000910⟧ The occurrence of any of these events could damage our land parcels and projects, cause delays in completion of our communities, reduce consumer demand for housing, cause delays in our supply chain, and cause shortages and price increases in labor or raw materials, any of which could affect our sales and profitability.
⟦s000911⟧ In addition to directly damaging our land or projects, many of these natural events could damage roads and highways providing access to our assets or affect the desirability of our land or communities, 30

⟦s000913⟧ Begin Page 43
⟦s000914⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS thereby adversely affecting our ability to market or sell homes in those areas and possibly increasing the costs of homebuilding.
⟦s000915⟧ Furthermore, the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, severe weather, and other adverse geologic conditions has increased in recent years due to climate change and may continue to increase in the future.
⟦s000916⟧ Climate change may have the effect of making the risks described above occur more frequently and more severely, which could amplify the adverse impact in our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s000917⟧ There are some risks of loss for which we may be unable to purchase insurance coverage.
⟦s000918⟧ For example, losses associated with hurricanes, landslides, prolonged periods of precipitation, earthquakes, and other weather-related and geologic events may not be insurable, and other losses, such as those arising from terrorism, may not be economically insurable.
⟦s000919⟧ A sizeable uninsured loss could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s000920⟧ Because of the seasonal nature of our business, our quarterly operating results fluctuate.
⟦s000921⟧ We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in our results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry.
⟦s000922⟧ We generally close more homes in our second, third, and fourth quarters.
⟦s000923⟧ As a result, our revenues may fluctuate on a quarterly basis, and we may have higher capital requirements in our second, third, and fourth quarters in order to maintain our inventory levels.
⟦s000924⟧ Accordingly, there is a risk that we will invest significant amounts of capital in the acquisition and development of land and construction of homes that we do not sell at anticipated pricing levels or within anticipated time frames.
⟦s000925⟧ If, due to market conditions, construction delays or other causes, we do not complete home orders at anticipated pricing levels or within anticipated time frames, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.
⟦s000926⟧ We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long term, and we cannot make any assurances as to the degree to which our historical seasonal patterns will occur in the future.
⟦s000927⟧ Changes to population growth rates in certain of the markets in which we operate or plan to operate could affect the demand for homes in these regions.
⟦s000928⟧ Slower rates of population growth or population declines in our markets in Atlanta, Birmingham, Charlotte, Huntsville, Nashville, Raleigh, Houston, or other key markets in the United States we may decide to enter in the future, especially as compared to the high population growth rates in prior years, could affect the demand for housing, cause home prices in these markets to fall and adversely affect our plans for growth, business, financial condition, and operating results.
⟦s000929⟧ Furthermore, while we have recently observed an increase in our business from people moving to more geographically diverse submarkets during the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot assure you that this trend will continue or not reverse.
⟦s000930⟧ Volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our cost of capital and our ability to access necessary financing and the difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital could prevent us from acquiring lots for our construction or increase costs and delays in the completion of our homebuilding expenditures.

⟦s000945⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS available under our Existing Credit Facility and our Amended Credit Facility or to seek alternative financing, which might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable or at all.
⟦s000946⟧ If we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements, volatility in credit or capital markets may restrict our flexibility to successfully obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
⟦s000947⟧ If we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures, we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of homes then under construction, or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots.
⟦s000948⟧ Any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance, cash flows, and ability to service our debt obligations.
⟦s000949⟧ Inflation could adversely affect our business and financial results.
⟦s000950⟧ Currently, the United States is experiencing inflationary conditions.
⟦s000951⟧ Inflation could adversely affect our business and financial results by increasing the costs of land, raw materials, and labor needed to operate our business.
⟦s000952⟧ If our markets have an oversupply of homes relative to demand, we may be unable to offset any such increases in costs with corresponding higher sales prices for our homes.
⟦s000953⟧ Inflation may also accompany higher interest rates, which could adversely impact a potential homebuyer’s ability to obtain financing on favorable terms, thereby further decreasing demand.
⟦s000954⟧ If we are unable to raise the prices of our homes to offset the increasing costs of our operations, our margins could decrease.
⟦s000955⟧ Furthermore, if we need to lower the price of our homes to meet demand, our profitability may decrease.
⟦s000956⟧ Inflation may also raise our costs of capital and decrease our purchasing power, making it more difficult to maintain sufficient funds to operate our business.
⟦s000957⟧ Our operations may be negatively impacted by inflation due to increasing construction costs, labor, and materials, as well as land acquisition financing costs.
⟦s000958⟧ The Federal Reserve materially raised interest rates in the current year and signaled additional interest rate increases which increased our financing costs and has reduced demand for our homes.
⟦s000959⟧ Our geographic concentration could materially and adversely affect us if the homebuilding industry in our current markets should decline.
⟦s000960⟧ Our business strategy is focused on the design, construction, and sale of single-family homes in five states across the Southeastern and Southern United States.
⟦s000961⟧ While our operations are geographically diverse and we may expand into additional markets, a prolonged economic downturn in one or more of the areas in which we operate, particularly within Atlanta, Georgia, our largest market, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, and a disproportionately greater impact on us than other homebuilders with larger scale and more diversified operations and geographic footprint.
⟦s000962⟧ Difficulties with appraisal valuations in relation to the proposed sales price of our homes could force us to reduce the price of our homes for sale.
⟦s000963⟧ Each of our home orders may require an appraisal of the home value before closing.
⟦s000964⟧ These appraisals are professional judgments of the market value of the property and are based on a variety of market factors.
⟦s000965⟧ If our internal valuations of the market and pricing do not line up with the appraisal valuations, and appraisals are not at or near the agreed upon sales price, we may be forced to reduce the sales price of the home to complete the sale.
⟦s000966⟧ These appraisal issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
⟦s000967⟧ If the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines, our profits could decrease, and we may incur losses.
⟦s000968⟧ Inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders.
⟦s000969⟧ The market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly because of changing market conditions.
⟦s000970⟧ In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing community or market.
⟦s000971⟧ We must continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets, as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets, which we generally accomplish by entering finished lot option contracts or land bank option contracts.
⟦s000972⟧ In the event of adverse changes in economic, market, or community conditions, we may cease further building activities in certain communities, restructure existing land banking option contracts, or elect not to exercise our land banking options.
⟦s000973⟧ Such actions would result in our forfeiture of some or all of any deposits, fees, or investments paid or made in respect of such arrangements, including any cost overruns.
⟦s000974⟧ The forfeiture of land contract deposits or inventory impairments may result in a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations, and future cash flows.

⟦s000978⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS A major health and safety incident relating to our business could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage.
⟦s000979⟧ Building sites are inherently dangerous and operating in the homebuilding and land development industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks.
⟦s000980⟧ Due to health and safety regulatory requirements and the number of projects we work on, health and safety performance is critical to the success of all areas of our business.
⟦s000981⟧ Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties or a suspension or cessation of our operations for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements or litigation, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result.
⟦s000982⟧ Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on our reputation and our relationships with relevant regulatory agencies, governmental authorities, and local communities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s000983⟧ Risks related to the operation of our business Our business model, which is dependent upon our ability to purchase and develop land at competitive prices and the ability of our homebuyers to be able to finance their home purchases through mortgage financing at accessible rates, can be substantially impacted by adverse changes in general economic conditions outside our control.
⟦s000984⟧ Our business can be substantially impacted by adverse changes in general economic conditions outside our control, including increases in short- and long-term interest rates, high inflation, and availability and cost of financing for homebuyers.
⟦s000985⟧ These adverse changes in economic conditions can cause mortgage rates to rise, demand and prices for our homes to diminish, current and future land banking contracts to be negatively impacted, or lead to longer and more costly build times for our homes.
⟦s000986⟧ We may not be able to recover these increased costs by raising prices, because of weak market conditions and because the price of each home we sell is usually set several months before the home is delivered, as many homebuyers sign their home purchase contracts before construction begins.
⟦s000987⟧ The potential difficulties described above could increase our costs or impact our homebuyers’ ability to obtain suitable financing and cause some homebuyers to cancel or refuse to honor their home purchase contracts altogether, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
⟦s000988⟧ Our inability to successfully identify, secure, and control an adequate inventory of lots at reasonable prices could adversely impact our operations.
⟦s000989⟧ The results of our homebuilding operations depend in part upon our continuing ability to successfully identify, control, and acquire an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations.
⟦s000990⟧ There is no guarantee an adequate supply of homebuilding lots will continue to be available to us on terms like those available in the past, or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling homebuilding lots than we have in the past.
⟦s000991⟧ In addition, because we employ a land-light business model, we may have access to fewer and less attractive homebuilding lots than if we owned lots outright, like some of our competitors who do not operate under a land-light model.
⟦s000992⟧ An insufficient supply of homebuilding lots in one or more of our markets, an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion, a loss or limitation of access to capital by our land bankers, delays in recording deeds or in conveying controlled lots as a result of government shut downs, stay-at-home orders, or other reasons, or our inability to purchase or finance homebuilding lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations, and future cash flows.
⟦s000993⟧ Any land shortages or any decrease in the supply of suitable land at reasonable prices could limit our ability to develop new communities or result in increased lot deposit requirements or land costs.
⟦s000994⟧ We may not be able to pass any increased land costs to our homebuyers, which could adversely impact our revenues, earnings, and margins.
⟦s000995⟧ We consider a lot controlled when we hold an option to acquire the applicable lot for the relevant timeframe set forth in the option contract.
⟦s000996⟧ After we sign a finished lot option contract, but prior to the deposit becoming non-refundable (except for certain circumstances such as seller default or force majeure events), we have an initial inspection and due diligence period (“Inspection Period”).
⟦s000997⟧ The Inspection Period is typically 60-120 days, during which time we inspect the property to make sure it meets certain development requirements (e.g.
⟦s000998⟧ , zoning, environmental approvals, and other customary requirements).
⟦s000999⟧ If we discover that the property does not 33

⟦s001001⟧ Begin Page 46
⟦s001002⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS sufficiently meet the development requirements after the Inspection Period has passed, we could lose some or all of any deposits, fees, or investments paid or made in respect of such arrangements, including any cost overruns, which could adversely impact our profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations, and future cash flows.
⟦s001003⟧ If the property meets our development requirements and successfully exits the Inspection Period, the deposit becomes non-refundable (except for certain circumstances such as seller default and force majeure events), and we proceed under the finished lot option contract with the lots available to us for purchase on a staggered takedown schedule, which is designed to mirror our expected home orders.
⟦s001004⟧ Our options to purchase lots typically expire at the end of each purchase date as set forth in the staggered takedown schedule of the applicable option contract.
⟦s001005⟧ As the fair market value of controlled lots fluctuates from the contracted purchase prices in our land banking option contracts, we attempt to renegotiate the terms of the option contracts to ensure lot prices and yields are aligned with current market conditions.
⟦s001006⟧ If, ultimately, we do not exercise our option to purchase, the seller then would have the option to terminate the agreement, which would then result in the loss of the option to purchase all remaining unpurchased lots and forfeiture of the remaining deposit for the unpurchased lots.
⟦s001007⟧ We do not typically receive a return of our deposit upon expiration or termination of the contract unless it is due to seller default or a force majeure event.
⟦s001008⟧ The forfeiture of land contract deposits or inventory impairments may result in a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations, and future cash flows.
⟦s001009⟧ Our business and results of operations are dependent on the availability, skill, and performance of trade partners.
⟦s001010⟧ We engage trade partners to perform the construction of our homes.
⟦s001011⟧ Accordingly, the timing and quality of our construction depend on the availability and skill of our trade partners.
⟦s001012⟧ While we anticipate being able to obtain reliable trade partners and believe that our relationships with trade partners are good, we do not have long-term, exclusive contractual commitments with any trade partners, and we can provide no assurance that skilled trade partners will continue to be available at reasonable rates and in our markets.
⟦s001013⟧ In addition, as we expand into new markets, we must develop new relationships with trade partners in such markets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in a cost-effective and timely manner, or at all.
⟦s001014⟧ Further, our ability to engage qualified trade partners could be affected by various national, regional, local, economic, and political factors, including changes in immigration laws and trends in labor migration.
⟦s001015⟧ Additionally, our markets may exhibit a reduced level of skilled labor relative to increased homebuilding demand.
⟦s001016⟧ Skilled labor shortages in the regions where we operate have made in the past, and may make in the future, the engagement of trade partners more difficult.
⟦s001017⟧ The inability to contract with skilled trade partners at reasonable rates on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001018⟧ Despite our quality control efforts, we may discover from time to time that our trade partners have engaged in improper construction practices or have installed defective materials in our homes.
⟦s001019⟧ When we discover these issues, we utilize our trade partners to repair the homes in accordance with our new home warranty program and as required by law.
⟦s001020⟧ The adverse costs of satisfying our warranty program and other legal obligations in these instances may be significant, and we may be unable to recover the costs of warranty-related repairs from trade partners and insurers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001021⟧ We may also suffer reputational damage from the actions of trade partners, which are beyond our control.
⟦s001022⟧ A shortage or increase in the costs of building materials could delay or increase the cost of home construction, which could have an adverse material impact on our business.
⟦s001023⟧ The residential construction industry experiences building material shortages from time to time, including shortages in supplies of insulation, drywall, cement, steel, and lumber.
⟦s001024⟧ These building material shortages can be more severe during periods of strong demand for housing, during periods following natural disasters that have a significant impact on existing residential and commercial structures, or as a result of broader economic disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
⟦s001025⟧ For example, there has recently been a lingering national shortage of electrical transformers due to both natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic.
⟦s001026⟧ While this shortage has recently shown signs of easing, it is uncertain whether or how quickly this shortage will be alleviated and inventories return to normal levels.
⟦s001027⟧ Further, prices of building materials could be affected by the factors discussed above and various other national, regional, local, economic, and political factors, including changes in tariffs.
⟦s001028⟧ Our success in recently entered markets or those we may choose to enter in the future depends substantially on our ability to source local 34

⟦s001030⟧ Begin Page 47
⟦s001031⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS materials on terms that are favorable to us.
⟦s001032⟧ In the event of shortages in building materials in such markets, local and suppliers may choose to allocate their resources to homebuilders with an established presence in the market and with whom they have longer-standing relationships.
⟦s001033⟧ Building material shortages and price increases for building materials could cause delays in and increase our costs of home construction and our construction cycle time, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001034⟧ Utility shortages or price increases could have an adverse impact on operations.
⟦s001035⟧ Certain of the markets in which we operate or plan to operate in the future may experience utility shortages as well as significant increases in utility costs.
⟦s001036⟧ For example, certain areas of North Carolina have experienced temporary disruptions to sewer system capacity and development in response to municipal infrastructure delays.
⟦s001037⟧ Additionally, municipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as electricity, natural gas, water, and sewer taps.
⟦s001038⟧ We may incur additional costs and may not be able to complete construction on a timely basis if such utility shortages, restrictions, moratoriums, and rate increases continue.
⟦s001039⟧ In addition, these utility issues may adversely affect the local economies in which we operate, which may reduce demand for housing in those markets.
⟦s001040⟧ Our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if further utility shortages, restrictions, moratoriums, or rate increases occur in our markets.
⟦s001041⟧ Increases in our home cancellation rate could have a negative impact on our home closing revenue and home closing gross margins.
⟦s001042⟧ We recognize homebuilding revenue at the time of the closing of a sale, at which time title to and possession of the property are transferred to the homebuyer.
⟦s001043⟧ When we execute sales contracts with homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, the cash deposits received are recorded as contract liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled.
⟦s001044⟧ We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.
⟦s001045⟧ Cancellations negatively impact the number of closed homes, net new orders, homebuilding revenues, and results of operations, as well as contract liabilities.
⟦s001046⟧ Cancellations can result from declines or slow appreciation in the market value of homes, increases in the supply of homes available to be purchased, increased competition, higher mortgage interest rates, and adverse changes in economic conditions.
⟦s001047⟧ During 2022 and part of 2023, demand weakened in response to additional increases in mortgage rates.
⟦s001048⟧ The market’s reaction to the deteriorating economic conditions negatively affected net new orders and has had a negative impact on our cancellation rate.
⟦s001049⟧ Any continued increase in the level of our cancellations would have a negative impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001050⟧ We are subject to warranty and liability claims arising in the ordinary course of business that can be significant.
⟦s001051⟧ As a homebuilder, we are subject to construction defect, product liability, and home and other warranty claims, including moisture intrusion and related claims, arising in the ordinary course of business.
⟦s001052⟧ These claims are common to the homebuilding industry and can be costly.
⟦s001053⟧ There is no assurance that any developments we undertake will be free from defects once completed, and any defects attributable to us may lead to significant contractual or other liabilities.
⟦s001054⟧ Although we provide trade partners with detailed specifications and perform quality control procedures, trade partners may, in some cases, use improper construction processes or defective materials.
⟦s001055⟧ Defective products used in the construction of our homes can result in the need to perform extensive repairs.
⟦s001056⟧ Under our warranty program, each of our homes comes with a limited warranty against certain building defects for up to one year after closing and a limited warranty against structural claims for up to ten years after closing.
⟦s001057⟧ When we discover the above issues, we utilize our trade partners to repair the homes in accordance with our trade partner agreements, our warranty program and as required by law.
⟦s001058⟧ We maintain and require our trade partners to maintain general liability insurance (including construction defect and bodily injury coverage) naming us as an additional insured and workers’ compensation insurance and generally seek to require our trade partners to provide a warranty to us and to defend and indemnify us for liabilities arising from their work.
⟦s001059⟧ Therefore, any claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the trade partners’ responsibility.
⟦s001060⟧ While these indemnities and insurance policies, subject to deductibles and other coverage limits, protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims related to our land development and homebuilding activities, we cannot 35

⟦s001063⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS provide assurance that these indemnities and insurance policies will be adequate to address all of our home and other warranty, product liability, and construction defect claims in the future, or that any potential inadequacies will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
⟦s001064⟧ The cost of performing such repairs (not covered by trade partner warranty or indemnities) or litigation arising out of such issues may be significant if we are unable to recover certain costs from trade partners, suppliers and/or insurers.
⟦s001065⟧ Warranty and construction defect matters can also result in negative publicity, including on social media platforms, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our ability to sell homes.
⟦s001066⟧ Further, the coverage offered by, and the availability of, general liability insurance for completed operations and construction defects are currently limited and costly.
⟦s001067⟧ While we record an estimate of warranty expense based on historical warranty costs, we cannot provide assurance that coverage will not become costlier and/or be further restricted, increasing our risks and financial exposure to claims.
⟦s001068⟧ If we are unable to develop our communities successfully or within expected timeframes, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
⟦s001069⟧ Although our preference is to acquire finished lots, we also have acquired in the past and expect to acquire in the future, property that requires further development before we can begin building homes.
⟦s001070⟧ When a community requires additional development, we devote substantial time and capital to obtain development approvals, acquire land, and construct significant portions of project infrastructure and amenities before the community generates any revenue.
⟦s001071⟧ In addition, our land bank option contracts often include interest provisions under which delays in land development and/or longer land takedown periods cause us to incur additional cost.
⟦s001072⟧ It can take several years from the time we acquire control of an undeveloped property to the time we get our first home order on the site.
⟦s001073⟧ Delays in the development of communities, including delays associated with trade partners performing the development activities or entitlements, expose us to the risk of changes in market conditions for homes.
⟦s001074⟧ A decline in our ability to successfully develop and market one of our new undeveloped communities and to generate positive cash flow from these operations in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and on our ability to service our debt and to meet our working capital requirements.
⟦s001075⟧ In addition, higher than expected absorption rates in existing communities may result in lower-than-expected inventory levels until the development for replacement communities is completed.
⟦s001076⟧ We may be unable to obtain suitable bonding for the development of our communities.
⟦s001077⟧ We are often required to provide bonds, letters of credit, or guarantees to governmental authorities and others to ensure completion of our communities.
⟦s001078⟧ As a result of market conditions, some municipalities and governmental authorities have been reluctant to accept surety bonds and instead require credit enhancements, such as cash deposits or letters of credit, in order to maintain existing bonds or issue new bonds.
⟦s001079⟧ If we are unable to obtain required bonds in the future for our communities, or if we are required to provide credit enhancements with respect to our current or future bonds or in place of bonds, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
⟦s001080⟧ We may suffer significant financial harm and loss of reputation if we do not comply, cannot comply, or are alleged to have not complied with applicable laws, rules and regulations concerning our classification and compensation practices for independent contractors.
⟦s001081⟧ Each of our divisions retain various independent contractors, either directly or indirectly through third-party entities formed by these independent contractors for their business purposes, including, without limitation, some of our sales agents.
⟦s001082⟧ With respect to these independent contractors, we are subject to the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regulations, and applicable state law guidelines regarding independent contractor classification.
⟦s001083⟧ These regulations and guidelines are subject to judicial and agency interpretation, and it might be determined that the independent contractor classification is inapplicable to any sales agents, vendors, or any other individual or entity characterized as an independent contractor.
⟦s001084⟧ Further, if legal standards for the classification of independent contractors change or appear to be changing, we may need to modify our compensation and benefits structure for such independent contractors, including by paying additional compensation or benefits or reimbursing expenses.
⟦s001085⟧ There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, administrative, or regulatory (including tax) authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change the independent contractor classification of any individual or vendor currently characterized as independent contractors doing 36

⟦s001088⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS business with us.
⟦s001089⟧ Although management believes there are no proposals currently pending that would significantly change the independent contractor classification, potential changes, if any, with respect to such classification could have a significant impact on our operating model.
⟦s001090⟧ Further, the costs associated with any such potential changes could have a significant effect on our results of operations and financial condition if we were unable to pass through to our homebuyers an increase in price corresponding to such increased costs.
⟦s001091⟧ Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, penalties, and damages, including back pay, unpaid benefits, taxes, expense reimbursement and attorneys’ fees, in defending future challenges to our employment classification or compensation practices.
⟦s001092⟧ Poor relations with the residents of our communities could negatively impact sales, which could cause our revenues or results of operations to decline.
⟦s001093⟧ Residents of communities we develop rely on us to resolve issues or disputes that may arise in connection with the operation or development of their communities.
⟦s001094⟧ Efforts made by us to resolve these issues or disputes could be deemed unsatisfactory by the affected residents, and subsequent actions by these residents could adversely affect our sales or our reputation.
⟦s001095⟧ In addition, we could be required to make material expenditures related to the settlement of such issues or disputes or to modify our community development plans, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
⟦s001096⟧ Our business depends on our ability to build and maintain a strong reputation and to receive favorable homebuyer reviews.
⟦s001097⟧ If we receive negative reviews, complaints, negative publicity or otherwise fail to live up to expectations, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and growth prospects.
⟦s001098⟧ Homebuyer complaints or negative publicity about our materials, homes, delivery times, sales and customer support, or marketing strategies, even if not accurate, especially on our website, blogs, and social media websites could diminish homebuyers’ views of our homes and result in harm to our brand.
⟦s001099⟧ We may be subject to delays and construction or product quality issues due to circumstances beyond our control which may impact our perceived performance and homebuyer satisfaction with our services and our homes.
⟦s001100⟧ This may result in negative reviews and publicity, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and growth prospects.
⟦s001101⟧ We may engage in joint venture or other unconsolidated entity investments which could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on the financial condition of our joint venture partners, and disputes between us and our joint venture partners.
⟦s001102⟧ We have in the past or may in the future co-invest with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures, or other unconsolidated entities, to acquire non-controlling interests in, and/or sharing responsibility for, managing the affairs of, a land acquisition, development, title insurance, and/or mortgage lending activities.
⟦s001103⟧ In this event, we would not be able to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the acquisition, development, title insurance, and/or mortgage lending activities, and our investment may be illiquid due to our lack of control.
⟦s001104⟧ We have in the past or may in the future have investments in and commitments to certain unconsolidated entities with related and unrelated strategic partners generally involved in real estate development, homebuilding, title insurance, and/or mortgage lending activities.
⟦s001105⟧ Investments in partnerships, joint ventures, or other unconsolidated entities may, under certain circumstances, involve incremental risks from involving a third party, including the possibility that our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, make poor business decisions, or block or delay necessary decisions.
⟦s001106⟧ Our joint venture partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.
⟦s001107⟧ Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor our joint venture partners would have full control over the land acquisition or development.
⟦s001108⟧ If the other partners in our partnerships or joint ventures do not cooperate or fulfill their contractual obligations due to their financial condition, strategic business interests, or otherwise, we may be required to spend additional resources or suffer losses, each of which could be significant.
⟦s001109⟧ Moreover, our ability to recoup such expenditures and losses by exercising remedies against such partners may be limited due to the contractual terms of the agreements, potential legal defenses they may have, their respective financial condition, and other circumstances.
⟦s001110⟧ Furthermore, because we lack a controlling interest in our unconsolidated entities we cannot exercise sole decision-making authority, which could create the potential risk of impasses on decisions and prevent the unconsolidated entity from taking, or not taking, actions that we believe may be in our best interests.

⟦s001114⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS In addition, as our relationships with our partners are contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the applicable agreements, including buy-sell provisions, we may not continue to own or operate the interests or assets underlying such relationship or may need to purchase additional interests or assets in the venture to continue ownership.
⟦s001115⟧ Disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business.
⟦s001116⟧ In addition, we may be liable for the actions of our joint venture partners in certain circumstances.
⟦s001117⟧ We could be adversely affected by efforts to impose joint employer liability on us for labor, safety, or worker’s compensation law violations committed by our trade partners.
⟦s001118⟧ Our homes are constructed by employees of trade partners and other third parties.
⟦s001119⟧ We do not have the ability to control what these parties pay their employees or the rules they impose on their employees.
⟦s001120⟧ However, various governmental agencies have taken actions to hold parties like us responsible for violations of wage and hour laws and other labor laws, safety laws, or worker’s compensation laws by trade partners.
⟦s001121⟧ Governmental rulings that hold us responsible for labor practices by our trade partners could create substantial exposures for us under our trade partner relationships, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001122⟧ The fabrication and installation of building products may pose certain health and safety risks to the employees of our trade partners.
⟦s001123⟧ The operations of our trade partners and trade partners are subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (as enforced by the U.
⟦s001124⟧ S.
⟦s001125⟧ Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), and equivalent state laws.
⟦s001126⟧ Changes to OSHA requirements, or stricter interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could result in increased costs to our trade partners, which could be passed on to us.
⟦s001127⟧ If we fail to comply with applicable OSHA regulations, are determined to be responsible for compliance with certain OSHA regulations, or are found jointly liable for any violations of OSHA regulations, even if no work-related serious injury or death occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement and be required to pay substantial penalties, incur significant capital expenditures, or suspend or limit operations.
⟦s001128⟧ Any accidents, citations, violations, injuries, or failure to comply with industry best practices or applicable regulations may subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position, and adversely affect our business.
⟦s001129⟧ Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties for reasonable prices in response to changing economic, financial, and investment conditions may be limited, and we may be forced to hold non-income producing properties for extended periods of time.
⟦s001130⟧ Real estate investments are relatively difficult to sell quickly.
⟦s001131⟧ As a result, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in response to changing economic, financial, and investment conditions is limited, and we may be forced to hold non-income producing assets for an extended period.
⟦s001132⟧ We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms that we set or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us.
⟦s001133⟧ We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.
⟦s001134⟧ There are various potential conflicts of interest in our relationship with founder and Executive Chairman Tom Bradbury, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interest of our stockholders.
⟦s001135⟧ Conflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future with the Founder Fund, a trust for which Mr. Bradbury is the co-trustee.
⟦s001136⟧ The trust is our majority stockholder.
⟦s001137⟧ We have leased, and we expect to continue to lease, office space from JBB Cherokee Holdings LLC, an entity affiliated with the Founder Fund.
⟦s001138⟧ We also had related person receivables with an entity affiliated with the Founder Fund as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and 2021, related to various general and administrative expenses, including aviation expenses, and in part, related to insurance that was paid on behalf of the related person who reimbursed us at cost.
⟦s001139⟧ Historically, Mr. Bradbury has also supported our growth by hosting numerous events at personal properties that are intended to foster business development and vendor relations.
⟦s001140⟧ For fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, we paid an annual use fee to certain entities affiliated with the Founder Fund for use of facilities and related services.
⟦s001141⟧ Additionally, we have two uncollateralized notes payable to an entity affiliated with the Founder Fund for the purchase of airplanes totaling $1.

⟦s001156⟧ ” The estimates, forecasts, and projections relating to our markets prepared by JBREC are based upon numerous assumptions and have not been independently verified by us.
⟦s001157⟧ This prospectus contains estimates, forecasts, and projections relating to our markets that were prepared for us for use in connection with this offering by JBREC, an independent research provider and consulting firm focused on the housing industry.
⟦s001158⟧ See “Market opportunity” in this prospectus for additional information.
⟦s001159⟧ The estimates, forecasts, and projections relate to, among other things, employment, demographics, household income, home sales prices, and affordability.
⟦s001160⟧ These estimates, forecasts, and projections are based on data (including third-party data), significant assumptions, proprietary methodologies, and the experience and judgment of JBREC, and we have not independently verified this information.
⟦s001161⟧ The estimates, forecasts, and projections are forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to be materially different from the projections.
⟦s001162⟧ JBREC has made these estimates, forecasts, and projections based on studying the historical and current performance of the residential housing market and applying JBREC’s qualitative knowledge about the residential housing market.
⟦s001163⟧ The future is difficult to predict, particularly given that the economy and housing markets can be cyclical and are subject to changing consumer and market psychology and governmental policies related to mortgage regulations and interest rates.
⟦s001164⟧ There will usually be differences between projected and actual outcomes because events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected, and such differences may be material.
⟦s001165⟧ For the foregoing reasons, JBREC cannot provide any assurance that the estimates, forecasts, and projections contained in this prospectus are accurate, actual outcomes may vary significantly from those contained or implied by the estimates, forecasts, and projections and you should not place undue reliance on these estimates, forecasts, and projections.
⟦s001166⟧ We have not independently verified these estimates, forecasts, and projections.
⟦s001167⟧ Except as required by law, we are not obligated to, and do not intend to, update the statements in this prospectus to conform to actual outcomes or changes in our or JBREC’s expectations.
⟦s001168⟧ Our future success depends upon our ability to successfully adapt our business strategy to evolving home buying patterns and trends.
⟦s001169⟧ Future home buying patterns and trends could reduce the demand for our homes and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
⟦s001170⟧ Part of our business strategy is to offer homes that appeal to a broad range of price-conscious entry-level and empty-nest homebuyers based on each local market in which we operate.
⟦s001171⟧ However, given the significant increases in average home sales prices across our markets and the anticipated increased demand for more affordable homes due to generational shifts, changing demographics, and other factors, we have increased our focus on offering more affordable housing options in our markets.
⟦s001172⟧ We believe that, due to anticipated generational shifts, changing demographics, and other factors, the demand for more affordable homes will increase.
⟦s001173⟧ We cannot make any assurances that our growth or expansion strategies will be successful, and we may incur a variety of costs to engage in such strategies, including through targeted acquisitions, and the anticipated benefits may never be realized.
⟦s001174⟧ We have expanded our business through selected investments in new geographic markets and by capturing market-share within our existing markets.
⟦s001175⟧ Investments in land, developed lots, and home inventories can expose us to risks of economic loss and inventory impairments if housing conditions weaken or we are unsuccessful in 39

⟦s001178⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS implementing our growth strategies.
⟦s001179⟧ Our long-term success and growth strategies depend in part upon continued availability of suitable land at acceptable prices.
⟦s001180⟧ The availability of land, lots, and home inventories for purchase at favorable prices depends on several factors outside of our control.
⟦s001181⟧ We may compete for available land with entities that possess significantly greater financial, marketing, and other resources.
⟦s001182⟧ In addition, some state and local governments in markets where we operate have approved, and others may approve, slow-growth or no-growth initiatives and other ballot measures that could negatively impact the availability of land and building opportunities within those areas.
⟦s001183⟧ Approval of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to build and sell homes in the affected markets and/or could require the satisfaction of additional administrative and regulatory requirements, which could result in slowing the progress or increasing the costs of our homebuilding operations in these markets.
⟦s001184⟧ Finally, our ability to begin new projects could be negatively impacted if we elect not to purchase land under our land banking option contracts.
⟦s001185⟧ We intend to grow our operations in existing markets and to strategically expand into new markets or pursue opportunistic purchases of other homebuilders on attractive terms, as such opportunities arise.
⟦s001186⟧ We may be unable to achieve the anticipated benefits of any such growth or expansion, including through targeted acquisitions or through efficiencies that we may be unable to achieve, the anticipated benefits may take longer to realize than expected, or we may incur greater costs than expected in attempting to achieve the anticipated benefits.
⟦s001187⟧ In such cases, we will likely need to employ additional personnel or trade partners that are knowledgeable about such markets.
⟦s001188⟧ There can be no assurance that we will be able to recruit, develop, or retain the necessary personnel or trade partners to successfully implement a disciplined management process and culture with local management, that our expansion operations will be successful, or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired homebuilder.
⟦s001189⟧ This could disrupt our ongoing operations, including our Rteam production model, and divert management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business.
⟦s001190⟧ We can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify, acquire, or implement these new strategies in the future.
⟦s001191⟧ Accordingly, any such expansion, including through acquisitions, could expose us to significant risks beyond those associated with operating our existing business and may adversely affect our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001192⟧ We may experience difficulties in integrating the operations of Devon Street Homes or any potential future acquisitions into our business or we may experience challenges in realizing expected benefits of each such acquisition.
⟦s001193⟧ On July 31, 2023, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Devon Street Homes.
⟦s001194⟧ See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Devon Street Homes Acquisition.
⟦s001195⟧ ” The success of the Devon Street Homes Acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities from combining the operations of Devon Street Homes with our business in an efficient and effective manner.
⟦s001196⟧ The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses, tax costs or inefficiencies or inconsistencies in standards, controls, IT systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees or other third parties, or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Devon Street Homes Acquisition, and could harm our financial performance.
⟦s001197⟧ If we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of Devon Street Homes with our business, we may incur unanticipated liabilities and be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies and other anticipated benefits resulting from the Devon Street Homes Acquisition, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
⟦s001198⟧ From time-to-time, we may evaluate other possible future acquisitions, some of which may be material.
⟦s001199⟧ Any potential future acquisitions may pose significant risks to our existing operations if they cannot be successfully integrated.
⟦s001200⟧ These acquisitions would place additional demands on our managerial, operational, financial, and other resources and create operational complexity requiring additional personnel and other resources.
⟦s001201⟧ Furthermore, the integration of Devon Street Homes or any future acquisition may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations.
⟦s001202⟧ We may incur significant costs in the integration of Devon Street Homes or any future acquisition and may not achieve cost synergies and other benefits sufficient to offset the costs of the Devon Street Homes Acquisition or any future acquired business.
⟦s001203⟧ Moreover, even if we were successful in integrating newly acquired businesses or assets, expected synergies or cost savings may not materialize, resulting in lower-than-expected benefits to us from such transactions.
⟦s001204⟧ We may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenue.
⟦s001205⟧ Additionally, when making acquisitions, it may not be possible for us 40

⟦s001207⟧ Begin Page 53
⟦s001208⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS to conduct a detailed investigation of the nature of the business or assets being acquired due to, for instance, time constraints in making the decision, and other factors.
⟦s001209⟧ We may become responsible for additional liabilities or obligations not foreseen at the time of an acquisition.
⟦s001210⟧ To the extent we pay the purchase price of an acquisition in cash, such an acquisition would reduce our cash reserves, and, to the extent the purchase price of an acquisition is paid with our stock, such an acquisition could be dilutive to our stockholders.
⟦s001211⟧ To the extent we pay the purchase price of an acquisition with proceeds from incurring debt, such an acquisition would increase our level of indebtedness and interest expense and could negatively affect our liquidity and restrict our operations.
⟦s001212⟧ To the extent that the purchase price of an acquisition is paid in the form of an earn-out on future financial results, the success of such an acquisition will not be fully realized by us for a period of time as it is shared with the sellers.
⟦s001213⟧ In addition, changes to the fair value of estimated earn-out payments could significantly impact our results of operations.
⟦s001214⟧ All of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001215⟧ We rely on SMART Builder, an enterprise resource planning system that we nonexclusively license from an entity affiliated with the Founder Fund for managing our construction process and work-flow scheduling.
⟦s001216⟧ If SMART Builder fails to adequately perform these functions or experiences an interruption in its operation, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
⟦s001217⟧ The efficient operation of our business depends on SMART Builder, an enterprise resource planning system that we nonexclusively license from an entity affiliated with the Founder Fund.
⟦s001218⟧ We rely on SMART Builder to effectively manage sales, purchasing, scheduling, production, accounting, servicing, and other functions.
⟦s001219⟧ SMART Builder is vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses or hackers, natural or man-made disasters, vandalism, terrorist attacks, power loss, or other computer systems, internet, telecommunications, or data network failures.
⟦s001220⟧ Any such interruptions to SMART Builder could disrupt our business and could result in decreased revenues and increased overhead costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.
⟦s001221⟧ For further discussion on the risks related to our software and information systems, see “Risks related to other legal, regulatory, and tax matters” below.
⟦s001222⟧ Risks related to other legal, regulatory, and tax matters Any limitation on, or reduction or elimination of, tax benefits associated with homeownership would have an adverse effect upon the demand for homes, which could be material to our business.
⟦s001223⟧ While tax laws generally permit significant expenses associated with homeownership, primarily mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, to be deducted for the purpose of calculating an individual’s federal and, in many cases, state taxable income, the ability to deduct mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes for federal income tax purposes is limited.
⟦s001224⟧ The federal government or a state government may change its income tax laws by eliminating, limiting, or substantially reducing these income tax benefits without offsetting provisions, which may increase the after-tax cost of owning a new home for many of our potential homebuyers.
⟦s001225⟧ For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which became effective January 1, 2018, contained substantial changes to the Code, including (i) limitations on the ability of our homebuyers to deduct property taxes, (ii) limitations on the ability of our homebuyers to deduct mortgage interest, and (iii) limitations on the ability of our homebuyers to deduct state and local income taxes.
⟦s001226⟧ Any further future changes may have an adverse effect on the homebuilding industry in general.

⟦s001228⟧ Any such future changes could also have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001229⟧ New and existing laws and regulations or other governmental actions may increase our expenses, limit the number of homes that we can build, or delay completion of our communities.
⟦s001230⟧ We are subject to numerous local, state, federal, and other statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction, accessibility, anti-discrimination, and other matters, which, among other things, impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area.

⟦s001236⟧ We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or zoning changes.
⟦s001237⟧ Such moratoriums generally relate to insufficient water supplies, sewage facilities, delays in utility hook-ups, or inadequate road capacity within specific market areas or subdivisions.
⟦s001238⟧ Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction.
⟦s001239⟧ Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety, and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development.
⟦s001240⟧ As a result of any of these statutes, ordinances, rules, or regulations, the timing of our home orders could be delayed, the number of our home orders could decline, and/or our costs could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.

⟦s001244⟧ The state of relationships between other countries and the United States with respect to trade policies, taxes, government relations, and tariffs may impact our business.
⟦s001245⟧ The federal government has imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and goods that are used in connection with the construction and delivery of our homes, including steel, aluminum, lumber, solar panels, and appliances, raising our costs for these items (or products made with them).

⟦s001252⟧ We and our trade partners are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, which may increase our costs, result in liabilities, limit the areas in which we can build homes, and delay completion of our communities.
⟦s001253⟧ We and our trade partners are subject to a variety of local, state, federal, and other environmental, health, and safety laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations, including those governing storm water and surface water management, discharge and releases of pollutants and hazardous materials into the environment, including air, groundwater, subsurface and soil, remediation activities, handling of hazardous materials, protection of wetlands, endangered plant and animal species and sensitive habitats, climate change, and human health and safety.
⟦s001254⟧ The environmental requirements that apply to any given site vary according to multiple factors, including the site’s location, its present and former uses, its environmental conditions, the presence or absence of wetlands, endangered plant or animal species, sensitive habitats, or the existence of environmental conditions at nearby or adjoining properties.
⟦s001255⟧ There is no guarantee that we will be able to identify all these considerations during any pre-acquisition or pre-development review of project sites or that such factors will not develop during our development and homebuilding activities.
⟦s001256⟧ Environmental requirements and conditions, particularly those that have not been previously identified and incorporated into development plans, may result in project delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation and other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity in certain areas, including environmentally sensitive regions or contaminated areas.
⟦s001257⟧ In addition, in those cases where endangered or threatened plant or animal species, wetlands, or other protected environmental resources are involved and agency rulemaking and litigation are ongoing, the outcome of such rulemaking and litigation can be unpredictable and, at any time, can result in unplanned or unforeseeable restrictions on, or the prohibition of development in, identified environmentally sensitive areas.
⟦s001258⟧ In some instances, regulators from different governmental agencies do not concur on development, remedial standards, or property use restrictions for a project, and the resulting delays or additional costs can be material for a given project.
⟦s001259⟧ Certain environmental laws and regulations also impose strict joint and several liability on former and current owners and operators of real property and in connection with third-party sites where parties have sent waste.
⟦s001260⟧ As a result, we may be held liable for environmental conditions we did not create on properties we currently or formerly owned or operated, including properties we have developed or properties to which we sent waste.

⟦s001265⟧ We could be subject to liability claims related to certain naturally occurring conditions, such as methane or radon, or conditions that may develop during or after construction, such as mold.
⟦s001266⟧ A mitigation plan may be implemented if a cleanup does not remove all contaminants of concern or adequately address a condition.
⟦s001267⟧ Some homebuyers may not want to purchase a home that is, or that may have been, subjected to remediation or a mitigation plan.
⟦s001268⟧ In addition, we do not maintain separate insurance policies for claims related to hazardous materials, and insurance coverage for such claims under our general commercial liability insurance may be limited or nonexistent.
⟦s001269⟧ Pursuant to such environmental, health, and safety laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations, we may be required to obtain permits and other approvals from applicable authorities to commence and conduct our development and homebuilding activities.
⟦s001270⟧ These permits and other approvals may contain restrictions that are costly or difficult to comply with, or may be opposed or challenged by local governments, environmental advocacy groups, neighboring property owners, or other interested parties, which may result in delays, additional costs, and non-approval of our activities.

⟦s001273⟧ Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) or OSHA, and similar federal, state, or local agencies review land developers’ and homebuilders’ compliance with environmental, health, and safety laws, statutes, ordinance, rules, and regulations, including those relating to the storage, handling or discharge of hazardous substances or the control of storm water discharges during construction.
⟦s001274⟧ Failure to comply with such laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations may result in civil and criminal fines and penalties, injunctions, suspension of our activities, remedial obligations, third-party claims, enforcement actions or other sanctions, or additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures.
⟦s001275⟧ Similarly, spills or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment could expose us to additional costs or liabilities, including for site investigation, remediation of contamination, or third-party claims for personal injury property damage or natural resource damages.
⟦s001276⟧ Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs and result in project delays.
⟦s001277⟧ We expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on land developers and homebuilders in the future.
⟦s001278⟧ We cannot assure you that environmental, health, and safety laws will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that would not have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001279⟧ We have provided environmental indemnities to certain land bankers and various third-party land developers in connection with our option contracts with them.
⟦s001280⟧ These indemnities obligate us to reimburse the indemnified parties for damages related to environmental matters, and, generally, there is no expiration or damage limitations on these indemnities.
⟦s001281⟧ Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that can have an adverse impact on our activities, operations, and profitability and on the availability and price of certain raw materials.
⟦s001282⟧ There is a growing concern about the emission of greenhouse gases and other human activities that have caused, and will continue to cause, significant changes in weather patterns and temperatures and increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters.
⟦s001283⟧ Government mandates, standards, legislation, and regulations enacted in response to these current and projected climate change impacts and concerns could result in restrictions on land development in certain areas or increased energy, transportation, and raw material costs.
⟦s001284⟧ On February 19, 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions every five years.
⟦s001285⟧ New legislation has been enacted, or may be enacted in the future, or considered for enactment at the federal, state, and local levels relating to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy production and use, including in response to the United States’ reentry into the Paris Agreement and the Biden Administration’s focus on climate change.
⟦s001286⟧ This legislation could relate to, for example, matters such as greenhouse gas emissions control and building and other codes that impose energy efficiency standards or require use of energy-saving construction materials.
⟦s001287⟧ New building or other code requirements that impose stricter energy efficiency standards or requirements for building materials could significantly increase our cost to construct homes.
⟦s001288⟧ As climate change concerns continue to grow, legislation, regulations, mandates, standards, and other requirements of this nature are expected to continue to be enacted and impose additional costs on us.
⟦s001289⟧ Additionally, certain areas in the United 43
⟦s001290⟧ End Page 55
⟦s001291⟧ Begin Page 56
⟦s001292⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS States either have enacted or are considering a ban on the use of natural gas appliances and/or natural gas hookups in new construction.
⟦s001293⟧ Such bans, if enacted in areas in which we operate or may decide to operate in the future, could affect our cost to construct homes.
⟦s001294⟧ Similarly, climate change-related initiatives or requirements impacting the energy industry affect a wide variety of companies throughout the United States, and because our operations are heavily dependent on significant amounts of raw materials with energy-intensive manufacturing and supply processes, such as lumber, steel and concrete, these initiatives or requirements could increase the costs of such materials and have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability.
⟦s001295⟧ Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, increases in sea level, and changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events.
⟦s001296⟧ These physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect our business and operations and there is no guarantee that any losses incurred would be covered by applicable insurance policies.
⟦s001297⟧ Failure to keep up with evolving trends, regulations, and expectations relating to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues could adversely impact our reputation, access to and cost of capital, and financial results.
⟦s001298⟧ Certain institutional investors, investment funds, creditors, influential financial markets participants, and other stakeholders have become increasingly focused on companies’ ESG issues in evaluating their investments and business relationships.
⟦s001299⟧ Certain organizations also provide assessments of companies’ ESG practices.
⟦s001300⟧ Although there are no universally accepted standards for such assessments, they are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions.
⟦s001301⟧ Unfavorable press about, or assessments of, our ESG practices, including the environmental impact of our operations, regardless of whether we comply with applicable legal requirements, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward us.
⟦s001302⟧ A failure to comply with ESG expectations and standards, which are evolving, or if we are perceived to not have responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, could cause reputational harm to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and access to and cost of capital.
⟦s001303⟧ In addition, the adoption of new ESG-related regulations applicable to our business, or pressure from key stakeholders to comply with voluntary ESG-related initiatives or frameworks, could require us to make substantial investments which could impact the results of our operations and cash flows.
⟦s001304⟧ The success of our business depends on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights.
⟦s001305⟧ Our success depends, in part, on our ability protect our intellectual property, proprietary information, and technology.
⟦s001306⟧ We rely, or may in the future rely, on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, unfair competition and trade secret laws, and other intellectual property rights, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection.
⟦s001307⟧ We also rely on non-registered proprietary information, technology, and intellectual property rights, including with respect to our home designs, such as unregistered copyrights, confidential information, trade secrets, know-how and technical information.
⟦s001308⟧ The steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate and we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property.
⟦s001309⟧ We attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology, and confidential information in part through confidentiality, nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, and other third parties who develop intellectual property on our behalf or with whom we share information.
⟦s001310⟧ However, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party who has developed intellectual property on our behalf or each party that has or may have had access to our confidential information, know-how, and trade secrets.
⟦s001311⟧ These agreements may not be self-executing or may be insufficient or breached, or may not effectively prevent unauthorized access to or unauthorized use, disclosure misappropriation or reverse engineering of, our intellectual property, technology, or confidential information.
⟦s001312⟧ Additionally, these agreements may not provide an adequate remedy for breaches or unauthorized uses or disclosures of our intellectual property, technology, or confidential information.
⟦s001313⟧ Individuals not subject to invention assignment agreements may make adverse ownership claims in respect of our current and future intellectual property, and to the extent that our employees, independent contractors, or other third parties with whom we do business use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

⟦s001317⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Even if we successfully maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets, intellectual property and other proprietary information, competitors may independently develop products or technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our own.
⟦s001318⟧ Enforcing a claim that a party disclosed proprietary information in an unauthorized manner or infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated any intellectual property rights is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable.
⟦s001319⟧ In addition, some courts are less willing or unwilling to protect certain intellectual property rights, and agreement terms that address non-competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and might not be enforceable in certain cases.
⟦s001320⟧ If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies or intellectual property, our competitive position, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.
⟦s001321⟧ If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest.
⟦s001322⟧ Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our trademark or trade name rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
⟦s001323⟧ Our current and future trademark applications in the United States may not be allowed or may subsequently be opposed.
⟦s001324⟧ Once filed and registered, our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, or declared generic, or determined to be infringing on other marks.
⟦s001325⟧ As a means to enforce our trademark rights and prevent infringement, we may be required to file trademark claims against third parties or initiate trademark opposition proceedings.
⟦s001326⟧ This can be expensive and time-consuming, particularly for a company of our size.
⟦s001327⟧ We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners or homebuyers in our markets of interest.
⟦s001328⟧ At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion.
⟦s001329⟧ In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names.
⟦s001330⟧ Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.
⟦s001331⟧ Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights, or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.
⟦s001332⟧ Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001333⟧ If third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, our operating profits could be adversely affected.
⟦s001334⟧ We face the risk of claims that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated third parties’ intellectual property rights.
⟦s001335⟧ Any claims of trademark or other intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or violation, even those without merit, could (i) be expensive and time consuming to defend; (ii) require us to rebrand or cease using or offering certain of our products, packaging or services, or otherwise modify our operations; (iii) divert management’s attention and resources; or (iv) require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property.
⟦s001336⟧ Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
⟦s001337⟧ A successful claim against us of third-party intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or violation could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or cease the infringing activity, any of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects.
⟦s001338⟧ We rely on licenses to use the intellectual property rights of third parties which are incorporated into our products, services, and offerings.
⟦s001339⟧ We rely, and expect to continue to rely on, certain services and intellectual property that we license from third parties for use in our operations, particularly SMART Builder, which we license from an entity affiliated with the Founder Fund.
⟦s001340⟧ We cannot be certain that our suppliers and licensors are not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others or that our suppliers and licensors have sufficient rights to the third-party technology used in our business in all jurisdictions in which we may operate.

⟦s001349⟧ Our information systems, and the information systems of any third-party vendors or suppliers we may use, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, computer viruses, cybersecurity incidents or attacks (including malware, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, social engineering and attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or other electronic security breaches or similar events, or cybersecurity attacks carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on systems or websites and rendering them unavailable or ineffective), other security breaches, natural or man-made disasters, usage errors, negligence or intentional misuse by our employees or third parties, and other related risks.
⟦s001350⟧ The risk of such damage or interruption has grown with the increased frequency and sophistication of cybersecurity attacks on companies in recent years.
⟦s001351⟧ We have and may continue to have cybersecurity incidents, attacks, or disruptions and although we have implemented, and our third-party vendors and suppliers may implement, various controls, systems and processes intended to secure these information systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems will be effective or that future attempted cybersecurity incidents, attacks, or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.
⟦s001352⟧ Any perceived or actual cybersecurity incident or attack or other disruption or failure in these information systems, or other systems or infrastructure upon which they rely, could result in unauthorized access to and misappropriation of confidential, sensitive, proprietary, or personal information in our possession or control, or extended interruptions of our operations.
⟦s001353⟧ Furthermore, any perceived or actual failure or breach of any information systems, or related theft, misuse, or loss of data, could result in a violation of applicable data privacy, cybersecurity, and other laws and regulations.
⟦s001354⟧ In short, a perceived or actual cybersecurity incident, attack, or other disruption could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, cause significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in our security measures.
⟦s001355⟧ Any such incident could harm our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001356⟧ Given the variety and potential severity of cybersecurity threats, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate against all losses, and we cannot ensure that applicable insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that our insurer will not deny coverage as to any particular claim.
⟦s001357⟧ Our business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and cybersecurity.

⟦s001359⟧ We may transfer some of this personal information to third parties who assist us with certain aspects of our business for limited purposes under appropriate contractual arrangements.
⟦s001360⟧ The regulatory environment surrounding data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change.
⟦s001361⟧ Laws and regulations governing data privacy, cybersecurity, and the unauthorized disclosure of personal information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, including the potential for inconsistent interpretation, and the implementation and maintenance of compliance measures may potentially elevate our costs.
⟦s001362⟧ Additionally, laws, regulations, and standards covering marketing, advertising, and other activities conducted by telephone, email, mobile devices, and the internet may be or become applicable to our business, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003.
⟦s001363⟧ While we have taken commercially reasonable steps to comply with applicable data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations, these laws and regulations are in some cases relatively new and the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations are uncertain.
⟦s001364⟧ Thus, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be deemed effective by regulatory bodies.
⟦s001365⟧ Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with applicable data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business.

⟦s001373⟧ Upon the consummation of this offering and the Transactions, we will be a holding company and will have no material assets other than our ownership of LLC Interests.
⟦s001374⟧ As such, we will have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes and operating expenses or declare and pay dividends in the future, if any, will be dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and distributions we receive from Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s001375⟧ There can be no assurance that Smith Douglas Holdings LLC will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative covenants in any applicable debt instruments, will permit such distributions.
⟦s001376⟧ Smith Douglas Holdings LLC is currently subject to debt instruments or other agreements that restrict its ability to make distributions to us, which may in turn affect Smith Douglas Holdings LLC’s ability to pay distributions to us and thereby adversely affect our cash flows.

⟦s001384⟧ Under the terms of the Smith Douglas LLC Agreement, Smith Douglas Holdings LLC will be obligated, subject to various limitations and restrictions, including with respect to our debt agreements, to make tax distributions to holders of LLC Interests, including us.
⟦s001385⟧ In addition to tax expenses, we will also incur expenses related to our operations, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which we expect will be significant.
⟦s001386⟧ See “Certain relationships and related person transactions—Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001387⟧ ” We intend, as its managing member, to cause Smith Douglas Holdings LLC to make cash distributions to the holders of LLC Interests in an amount sufficient to (i) fund all or part of their tax obligations in respect of taxable income allocated to them and (ii) cover our operating expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001388⟧ However, Smith Douglas Holdings LLC’s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which Smith Douglas Holdings LLC is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering Smith Douglas Holdings LLC insolvent.
⟦s001389⟧ If we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities, or to fund our operations (including, if applicable, because of an acceleration of our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement), we may have to borrow funds, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any lenders of such funds.
⟦s001390⟧ To the extent we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting in the acceleration of payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001391⟧ See “Certain relationships and related person transactions—Tax Receivable Agreement” and “Certain relationships and related person transactions—Smith Douglas LLC Agreement—Agreement in effect upon consummation of the Transactions—Distributions.

⟦s001400⟧ We will have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash) to our stockholders.
⟦s001401⟧ No adjustments to the exchange ratio for LLC Interests and corresponding shares of Class A common stock will be made as a result of any cash dividend or distribution by us or any retention of cash by us.
⟦s001402⟧ As a result, the holders of LLC Interests (other than us) may benefit from any value attributable to such cash balances if they acquire shares of Class A common stock in exchange for their LLC Interests, notwithstanding that such holders may have participated previously as holders of LLC Interests in distributions that resulted in such excess cash balances to us.
⟦s001403⟧ See “Description of capital stock.
⟦s001404⟧ ” To the extent we do not distribute such excess cash as dividends on our Class A common stock we may take other actions with respect to such excess cash, for example, holding such excess cash, or lending or contributing it (or a portion thereof) to Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, which may result in shares of our Class A common stock increasing in value relative to the value of LLC Interests.
⟦s001405⟧ Following a contribution of such excess cash to Smith Douglas Holdings LLC we may make an adjustment to the outstanding number of LLC Interests held by holders of LLC Interests (other than us).
⟦s001406⟧ The Tax Receivable Agreement with the Continuing Equity Owners requires us to make cash payments to them in respect of certain tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and we expect that such payments will be substantial.
⟦s001407⟧ In connection with this offering, we will enter into a Tax Receivable Agreement with Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and each of the Continuing Equity Owners.
⟦s001408⟧ Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will be required to make cash payments to the Continuing Equity Owners equal to 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) Basis Adjustments; (ii) Section 704(c) Allocations; and (iii) certain tax benefits (such as interest deductions) arising from payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001409⟧ We will be required to make such payments to the Continuing Equity Owners even if all of the Continuing Equity Owners were to exchange or redeem their remaining LLC Interests.
⟦s001410⟧ The payment obligation is an obligation of Smith Douglas Homes Corp. and not of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s001411⟧ We expect that the amount of the cash payments we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial.
⟦s001412⟧ Any payments made by us to the Continuing Equity Owners under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not be available for reinvestment in our business and will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us.
⟦s001413⟧ To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting in the acceleration of payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001414⟧ See “Certain relationships and related person transactions—Tax Receivable Agreement” and “Certain relationships and related person transactions—Smith Douglas LLC Agreement—Agreement in effect upon consummation of the Transactions—Distributions.
⟦s001415⟧ ” Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC by the exchanging Continuing Equity Owners.
⟦s001416⟧ Furthermore, if we experience a change of control (as defined under the Tax Receivable Agreement), which includes certain mergers, asset sales, and other forms of business combinations, we would be obligated to make an immediate payment, and such payment may be significantly in advance of, and may materially exceed, the actual realization, if any, of the future tax benefits to which the payment relates.
⟦s001417⟧ This payment obligation could (i) make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) result in holders of our Class A common stock receiving substantially less consideration in connection with a change of control transaction than they would receive in the absence of such obligation.
⟦s001418⟧ Accordingly, the Continuing Equity Holders’ interests may conflict with those of the holders of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001419⟧ Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax laws and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we expect that the tax savings associated with the purchase of LLC Interests in connection with this offering, together with future redemptions or exchanges of all remaining LLC Interests owned by the Continuing Equity Owners pursuant to the Smith Douglas LLC Agreement as described above, would aggregate to approximately $215.
⟦s001420⟧ 8 million over 26 years from the date of this offering based on the assumed initial public offering price of $19.
⟦s001421⟧ 50 per share of our Class A common stock, which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and assuming all redemptions or exchanges would occur immediately after the initial public offering, which is assumed to occur on September 30, 2023 for 48

⟦s001424⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS purposes of the pro forma information presented herein and elsewhere in this prospectus.
⟦s001425⟧ Under such scenario, assuming future payments are made on the date each relevant tax return is due, without extensions, we would be required to pay approximately 85% of such amount, or approximately $183.
⟦s001426⟧ 5 million, over the 26-year period from the date of this offering.
⟦s001427⟧ The actual Basis Adjustments and Section 704(c) Allocations and the actual utilization of any resulting tax benefits, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors including: the timing of redemptions by the Continuing Equity Owners; the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange; the extent to which such exchanges are taxable; the amount of gain recognized by such Continuing Equity Owners; the amount and timing of the taxable income allocated to us or otherwise generated by us in the future; the portion of our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement constituting imputed interest; and the federal and state tax rates then applicable.
⟦s001428⟧ Our organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the Continuing Equity Owners that will not benefit holders of our Class A common stock to the same extent that it will benefit the Continuing Equity Owners.
⟦s001429⟧ Our organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the Continuing Equity Owners that will not benefit the holders of our Class A common stock to the same extent that it will benefit the Continuing Equity Owners.
⟦s001430⟧ We will enter into the Tax Receivable Agreement with Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and the Continuing Equity Owners in connection with this offering and the Transactions, which will provide for the payment by us to the Continuing Equity Owners of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) Basis Adjustments; (ii) Section 704(c) Allocations; and (iii) certain tax benefits (such as interest deductions) arising from payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001431⟧ See “Certain relationships and related person transactions—Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001432⟧ ” Although we will retain 15% of the amount of such tax benefits, this and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the future trading market for our Class A common stock.
⟦s001433⟧ In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the Continuing Equity Owners may be accelerated or significantly exceed any actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001434⟧ The Tax Receivable Agreement will generally apply to each of our taxable years, beginning with the first taxable year ending after the consummation of the Transactions.
⟦s001435⟧ There is no maximum term for the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001436⟧ However, the Tax Receivable Agreement will provide that if (i) we materially breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, (ii) certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control occur after the consummation of this offering, or (iii) we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then our obligations, or our successor’s obligations, under the Tax Receivable Agreement to make payments will be determined based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we will have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001437⟧ As a result of the foregoing, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, based on certain assumptions, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits.
⟦s001438⟧ Such cash payment to the Continuing Equity Owners could be greater than the specified percentage of any actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001439⟧ In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control.
⟦s001440⟧ For example, should we elect to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement immediately following this offering, assuming no material changes in the relevant tax laws or tax rates and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax potential benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we estimate that the aggregate of termination payments would be approximately $88.
⟦s001441⟧ 4 million based on the assumed initial public offering price of $19.
⟦s001442⟧ 50 per share of our Class A common stock, which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and assuming the discount rate were to be 10.
⟦s001443⟧ 31%.
⟦s001444⟧ There can be no assurance that we will be able to fund or finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001445⟧ We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.

⟦s001449⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS We will not be reimbursed for any payments made to the Continuing Equity Owners under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.
⟦s001450⟧ Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the IRS, or another tax authority, may challenge all or part of the Basis Adjustments, Section 704(c) Allocations, or other tax benefits we claim, as well as other related tax positions we take, and a court could sustain such challenge.
⟦s001451⟧ If the outcome of any such challenge would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the rights and obligations of Continuing Equity Owners under the Tax Receivable Agreement, then we will not be permitted to settle such challenge without the consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of Continuing Equity Owners.
⟦s001452⟧ The interests of Continuing Equity Owners in any such challenge may differ from or conflict with our interests and your interests, and Continuing Equity Owners may exercise their consent rights relating to any such challenge in a manner adverse to our interests and your interests.
⟦s001453⟧ We will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the Continuing Equity Owners under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits initially claimed by us and for which payment has been made to a Continuing Equity Owner are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed.
⟦s001454⟧ Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to a Continuing Equity Owner will be netted against future cash payments, if any, that we might otherwise be required to make to such Continuing Equity Owner, under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001455⟧ However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to a Continuing Equity Owner for a number of years following the initial time of such payment.
⟦s001456⟧ Moreover, the excess cash payments we made previously under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be greater than the amount of future cash payments against which we would otherwise be permitted to net such excess.
⟦s001457⟧ The applicable U.
⟦s001458⟧ S.
⟦s001459⟧ federal income tax rules for determining applicable tax benefits we may claim are complex and factual in nature, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with our tax reporting positions.
⟦s001460⟧ As a result, payments could be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement significantly in excess of any actual cash tax savings that we realize in respect of the tax attributes with respect to a Continuing Equity Owner that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001461⟧ Changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
⟦s001462⟧ We are subject to taxation by U.
⟦s001463⟧ S.
⟦s001464⟧ federal, state, and local tax authorities.
⟦s001465⟧ Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including: • allocation of expenses to and among different jurisdictions; • changes to our assessment about our ability to realize, or in the valuation of, our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business; • expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances; • tax effects of stock-based compensation; • costs related to intercompany restructurings; • changes in tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; • the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals; • lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates; and • limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.
⟦s001466⟧ Any changes in U.

⟦s001469⟧ In particular, new income or other tax laws or regulations could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.

⟦s001474⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS If we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), including as a result of our ownership of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
⟦s001475⟧ Under Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an “investment company” for purposes of the 1940 Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, or (ii) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.
⟦s001476⟧ S.
⟦s001477⟧ government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.
⟦s001478⟧ We do not believe that we are an “investment company,” as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.
⟦s001479⟧ We and Smith Douglas Holdings LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company.
⟦s001480⟧ As the sole managing member of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, we will control and operate Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s001481⟧ On that basis, we believe that our interest in Smith Douglas Holdings LLC is not an “investment security” as that term is used in the 1940 Act.
⟦s001482⟧ However, if we were to cease participation in the management of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, or if Smith Douglas Holdings LLC itself becomes an investment company, our interest in Smith Douglas Holdings LLC could be deemed an “investment security” for purposes of the 1940 Act.
⟦s001483⟧ We and Smith Douglas Holdings LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company.
⟦s001484⟧ If it were established that we were an unregistered investment company, there would be a risk that we would be subject to monetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by the U.
⟦s001485⟧ S.
⟦s001486⟧ Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties and that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company.
⟦s001487⟧ If we were required to register as an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
⟦s001488⟧ We depend on key management personnel and other experienced employees.
⟦s001489⟧ Our success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain key management personnel, including, but not limited to, our founder and Executive Chairman Tom Bradbury; our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Vice Chairman Greg Bennett; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Russell Devendorf.
⟦s001490⟧ Although we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Bennett and Mr. Devendorf, there is no guarantee that Mr. Bennett and Mr. Devendorf will remain employed by us.
⟦s001491⟧ Our ability to retain our key management personnel, or to attract suitable replacements should any existing members of our management team leave, is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market.
⟦s001492⟧ The loss of services from key management personnel or a limitation in their availability could materially and adversely impact our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001493⟧ Further, such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets.
⟦s001494⟧ We have not obtained key person life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our key management personnel.
⟦s001495⟧ Experienced employees in the homebuilding, land acquisition, development, and construction industries are fundamental to our ability to generate, obtain, and manage opportunities.
⟦s001496⟧ In particular, local knowledge and relationships are critical to our ability to source attractive land acquisition opportunities.
⟦s001497⟧ Experienced employees working in the homebuilding, development, and construction industries are highly sought after.
⟦s001498⟧ Failure to attract and retain such personnel or to ensure that their experience and knowledge is not lost when they leave the business through retirement, redundancy or otherwise may adversely affect the standards of our service and may have an adverse impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001499⟧ Our current financing arrangements contain, and our future financing arrangements likely will contain, restrictive covenants.
⟦s001500⟧ Our current financing arrangements (including the Existing Credit Facility and Amended Credit Facility) contain, and the financing arrangements we enter in the future likely will contain, covenants (financial and otherwise) affecting our ability to incur additional debt, make certain investments, reduce liquidity below certain levels, make distributions to our stockholders, and otherwise affect our operating policies.
⟦s001501⟧ The restrictions contained in our 51
⟦s001502⟧ End Page 63
⟦s001503⟧ Begin Page 64
⟦s001504⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS financing arrangements could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs, make acquisitions, or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans.
⟦s001505⟧ For example, the Amended Credit Facility’s financial covenants include (i) a minimum tangible net worth requirement, (ii) a maximum leverage ratio, (iii) a minimum ratio of EBITDA to interest incurred, and (iv) a minimum liquidity requirement.
⟦s001506⟧ If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants in our debt agreements, we would be in default under these agreements, and our lenders could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable, terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral, or enforce their respective interests against existing collateral.
⟦s001507⟧ A default also could significantly limit our financing alternatives, which could cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or dispose of assets when we otherwise would not choose to do so.
⟦s001508⟧ If we default on several of our debt agreements or any single significant debt agreement, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001509⟧ We expect to use leverage in executing our business strategy, which may adversely affect the return on our assets.
⟦s001510⟧ We may incur a substantial amount of debt in the future.
⟦s001511⟧ Our existing indebtedness is recourse to us, and we anticipate that future indebtedness will likewise be recourse.
⟦s001512⟧ As of September 30, 2023, we had $71.
⟦s001513⟧ 0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Existing Credit Facility bearing interest at the rate of 8.
⟦s001514⟧ 25% and $5.
⟦s001515⟧ 0 million outstanding under a three-year promissory note payable bearing interest at the rate of 8.
⟦s001516⟧ 0%.
⟦s001517⟧ Our board of directors will consider several factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the purchase price of assets to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our assets, and the ability of particular assets, and us as a whole, to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service.
⟦s001518⟧ Our governing corporate documents do not contain a limitation on the amount of debt we may incur, and our board of directors may change our target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders.
⟦s001519⟧ Incurring a substantial amount of debt could have important consequences for our business, including: • making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt or to our trade or other creditors; • increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; • limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited; • requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and the proceeds from this offering for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows and the proceeds from this offering to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate requirements; • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and • placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.
⟦s001520⟧ We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us through capital markets financings or under our credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.
⟦s001521⟧ We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before its maturity.
⟦s001522⟧ We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
⟦s001523⟧ In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness to finance our operations or to repay existing indebtedness.
⟦s001524⟧ If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional debt or equity, financing, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, and alliances.
⟦s001525⟧ We cannot assure you that any such actions, if necessary, could be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.
⟦s001526⟧ Our PPP Loan eligibility and forgiveness, while approved, remains subject to audit for compliance with applicable Small Business Administration (“SBA”) requirements.
⟦s001527⟧ As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we sought and obtained support through various business assistance programs.
⟦s001528⟧ We applied for and, on May 1, 2020, received a Paycheck Protection Program Loan in the amount of 52

⟦s001531⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS $5.
⟦s001532⟧ 1 million (the “PPP Loan”), under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), as administered by the SBA.
⟦s001533⟧ The application for receipt of the PPP Loan required us to certify, in good faith, that the attendant economic uncertainty made the loan necessary to support our ongoing operations.
⟦s001534⟧ On August 16, 2021, we received notice the full principal amount and all accrued interest thereon of the PPP Loan was formally forgiven by the SBA.
⟦s001535⟧ Under the terms of the PPP Loan, we must retain all related records for a period of six years from the date the loan was forgiven.
⟦s001536⟧ During this period, our PPP Loan eligibility and loan forgiveness application are subject to review and audit by the SBA.
⟦s001537⟧ We are aware of the requirements of the PPP Loan and believe we are within the eligibility threshold and have used the loan proceeds in accordance with the PPP Loan forgiveness requirements.
⟦s001538⟧ We have retained all necessary documentation supporting our eligibility.
⟦s001539⟧ If, despite our actions and good faith belief that we satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP Loan, we are made subject to an audit and are found to have been ineligible to receive the PPP Loan or forgiveness thereof, or are found in violation of any of the laws or regulations that apply to us in connection with the PPP Loan, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, and could be required to repay the PPP Loan.
⟦s001540⟧ An audit by the SBA could consume significant financial and management resources.
⟦s001541⟧ Any of these events could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
⟦s001542⟧ Risks related to this offering and ownership of our Class A common stock The Continuing Equity Owners will continue to have significant influence over us after this offering, including control over decisions that require the approval of stockholders.
⟦s001543⟧ Upon consummation of this offering, the Continuing Equity Owners will control, in the aggregate, approximately 98.
⟦s001544⟧ 3% of the voting power represented by all our outstanding shares of capital stock, assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock.
⟦s001545⟧ As a result, the Continuing Equity Owners will continue to exercise significant influence over all matters on which holders of Class B common stock are entitled to vote, including the election and removal of directors (subject to the rights of the holders of preferred stock, if any), amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, and any approval of significant corporate transactions (including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets), and will continue to have significant control over our business, affairs, and policies, including the appointment of our management, through their influence over the board composition.
⟦s001546⟧ The directors, whom the Continuing Equity Owners will have the ability to elect through their voting power, will have the authority to incur additional debt, issue or repurchase stock, declare dividends, and make other decisions that could be detrimental to stockholders.
⟦s001547⟧ We expect that certain members of our board will continue to be affiliated with the Continuing Equity Owners.
⟦s001548⟧ The Continuing Equity Owners can take actions that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares.
⟦s001549⟧ These actions may be taken even if other stockholders oppose them.
⟦s001550⟧ The concentration of voting power with the Continuing Equity Owners may have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001551⟧ The Continuing Equity Owners may have interests that are different from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests.
⟦s001552⟧ Our stock price may change significantly following the offering, and you may not be able to resell shares of our Class A common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.
⟦s001553⟧ The initial public offering price for the shares was determined by negotiations between us and the underwriters.
⟦s001554⟧ You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the initial public offering price due to a number of factors included herein, including the following: • results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors; • results of operations that vary from those of our competitors; • changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors; • technology changes, changes in consumer behavior in our industry; • security breaches related to our systems or those of our affiliates or strategic partners; 53

⟦s001558⟧ Furthermore, the stock market may experience extreme volatility that, in some cases, may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies.
⟦s001559⟧ These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
⟦s001560⟧ In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our Class A common stock is low.
⟦s001561⟧ In the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation.
⟦s001562⟧ If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.
⟦s001563⟧ We cannot predict the effect our dual class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001564⟧ We cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock, adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences.
⟦s001565⟧ For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indices.
⟦s001566⟧ In July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituents of its indices to have greater than 5% of the company’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it will no longer admit companies with multiple-class share structures to certain of its indices.
⟦s001567⟧ Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500.
⟦s001568⟧ Also in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indices and in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal voting structures” in its indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria.
⟦s001569⟧ Under such announced policies, the dual class structure of our stock would make us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to track those indices would not invest in our Class A common stock.
⟦s001570⟧ These policies are relatively new, and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of publicly traded companies excluded from such 54

⟦s001573⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS indices, but it is possible they may depress valuations, compared to similar companies that are included.
⟦s001574⟧ Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors.

⟦s001613⟧ Holders should consult their tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001614⟧ Upon the listing of our Class A common stock, we will be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of the Exchange and, as a result, will qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.
⟦s001615⟧ You may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such corporate governance requirements.
⟦s001616⟧ After the consummation of this offering, Founder Fund, a trust controlled by our founder and Executive Chairman Tom Bradbury, will have more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors, and, as a result, we will be considered a “controlled company” for the purposes of the corporate governance rules of the Exchange.
⟦s001617⟧ The corporate governance requirements and specifically the independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who are considered independent are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors.
⟦s001618⟧ Following this offering, we intend to utilize certain exemptions from corporate governance requirements that are afforded to a “controlled company” under the Exchange rules.
⟦s001619⟧ For example, we will not have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.
⟦s001620⟧ From time to time, we may rely on additional exemptions provided to controlled companies under the Exchange rules.
⟦s001621⟧ Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all the corporate governance requirements of the Exchange.
⟦s001622⟧ Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.
⟦s001623⟧ Certain provisions of Delaware law and antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.
⟦s001624⟧ Certain provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an antitakeover effect and may delay, defer, or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt, or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.
⟦s001625⟧ These provisions provide for, among other things: • the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval; • at any time prior to the Sunset Date, our stockholders may take action by consent without a meeting, and from and after the occurrence of the Sunset Date, our stockholders may not take action by consent without a meeting, but may only take action at a meeting of stockholders; 55

⟦s001627⟧ Begin Page 68
⟦s001628⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS • vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders; • advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders; • at any time prior to the Sunset Date, the Secretary (or other officer or our board of directors) at the request of any Continuing Equity Owner owning at least 5% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon may call a special meeting of stockholders, and from and after the occurrence of the Sunset Date, our stockholders will be unable to call a special meeting of stockholders; • no cumulative voting in the election of directors; • prior to the Sunset Date, directors may be removed at any time with or without cause upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon, and from and after the occurrence of the Sunset Date, directors may be removed with or without cause and only upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon; and • that certain provisions of amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended only by the affirmative vote of holder of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of our then-outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon.
⟦s001629⟧ These antitakeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders.
⟦s001630⟧ As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.
⟦s001631⟧ In addition, we have opted out of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), but our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder (generally defined as any stockholder with 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such stockholder) for a period of three years following the time on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions (except with respect to the Continuing Equity Owners and any of their respective affiliates and any of their respective direct or indirect transferees of our common stock).
⟦s001632⟧ See “Description of capital stock.
⟦s001633⟧ ” We will become subject to financial reporting and other requirements as a public company for which our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared.
⟦s001634⟧ As a public company with listed equity securities, we will need to comply with new laws, regulations, and requirements, including the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and related regulations and requirements of the SEC, with which we were not required to comply as a private company.
⟦s001635⟧ The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition.
⟦s001636⟧ The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting.
⟦s001637⟧ Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our management and independent auditors to report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
⟦s001638⟧ However, we are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), so for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404.
⟦s001639⟧ Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemptions, we will be required to include an opinion from our independent auditors on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
⟦s001640⟧ These reporting and other obligations will place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational, and accounting resources and will cause us to incur significant expenses.
⟦s001641⟧ We may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, create or outsource an internal audit function, and hire additional accounting and finance staff.
⟦s001642⟧ If we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired.
⟦s001643⟧ Any failure to maintain 56
⟦s001644⟧ End Page 68
⟦s001645⟧ Begin Page 69
⟦s001646⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001647⟧ We also expect that being a public company and these rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage.
⟦s001648⟧ These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.
⟦s001649⟧ As a result of disclosure of information in this prospectus and in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties.
⟦s001650⟧ If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.
⟦s001651⟧ The JOBS Act will allow us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information we provide in our reports filed with the SEC. We cannot be certain if this reduced disclosure will make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.
⟦s001652⟧ The JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on “emerging growth companies.
⟦s001653⟧ ” As defined in the JOBS Act, a public company whose initial public offering of common equity securities occurs after December 8, 2011, and whose annual net sales are less than $1.
⟦s001654⟧ 235 billion will, in general, qualify as an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of: • the last day of its fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of its initial public offering of common equity securities; • the last day of its fiscal year in which it has annual gross revenue of $1.
⟦s001655⟧ 235 billion or more; • the date on which it has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt; and • the date on which it is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” which will occur at such time as we (i) have an aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (ii) have been required to file annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange, for a period of at least 12 months, and (iii) have filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act.
⟦s001656⟧ Under this definition, we will be an “emerging growth company” upon completion of this offering and could remain an “emerging growth company” until as late as the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering.
⟦s001657⟧ For so long as we are an “emerging growth company,” we will, among other things: • not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; • not be required to hold a nonbinding advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation pursuant to Section 14A(a) of the Exchange Act; • not be required to seek stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved pursuant to Section 14A(b) of the Exchange Act; • be exempt from the requirement of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor’s report on the financial statements; and • be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
⟦s001658⟧ In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can use the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
⟦s001659⟧ This permits an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
⟦s001660⟧ We have chosen to “opt out” of this transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are adopted.
⟦s001661⟧ This decision to opt out of the extended transition period is irrevocable.

⟦s001665⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of our decision to take advantage of some or all of the reduced disclosure requirements above.
⟦s001666⟧ If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.
⟦s001667⟧ The historical and pro forma financial information in this prospectus may make it difficult to accurately predict our costs of operations in the future.
⟦s001668⟧ The historical financial information in this prospectus does not reflect the added costs we expect to incur as a public company or the resulting changes that will occur in our capital structure and operations.
⟦s001669⟧ In preparing our pro forma financial information we have given effect to, among other items, the Transactions, the Refinancing, and the Devon Street Homes Acquisition.
⟦s001670⟧ The estimates we used in our pro forma financial information may not be similar to our actual experience as a public company.
⟦s001671⟧ For more information on our historical financial information and pro forma financial information, see “Unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information,” “Selected historical and pro forma condensed consolidated financial and other data,” “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,” “Our organizational structure,” and our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.
⟦s001672⟧ Because we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our Class A common stock following this offering, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.
⟦s001673⟧ While Smith Douglas Holdings LLC has historically had high returns on equity, we do not anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our Class A common stock immediately following this offering.
⟦s001674⟧ Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, general and economic conditions, our results of operations and financial condition, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax, and regulatory restrictions, and such other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.
⟦s001675⟧ In addition, our ability to pay dividends is, and may be, limited by covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur.
⟦s001676⟧ Therefore, any return on investment in our Class A common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our Class A common stock on the open market, which may not occur.
⟦s001677⟧ See “Dividend policy” for more detail.
⟦s001678⟧ No market currently exists for our Class A common stock, and an active, liquid trading market for our Class A common stock may not develop, which may cause our Class A common stock to trade at a discount from the initial offering price and make it difficult for you to sell the Class A common stock you purchase.
⟦s001679⟧ Prior to this offering, there has not been a public market for our Class A common stock.
⟦s001680⟧ We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of a trading market or how active and liquid that market may become.
⟦s001681⟧ If an active and liquid trading market does not develop or continue, you may have difficulty selling any of our Class A common stock that you purchase, at a price above the price you purchase it or at all.
⟦s001682⟧ The initial public offering price for the shares was determined by negotiations between us and the underwriters and may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the open market following this offering.
⟦s001683⟧ The failure of an active and liquid trading market to develop and continue would likely have a material adverse effect on the value of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001684⟧ The market price of our Class A common stock may decline below the initial offering price, and you may not be able to sell your shares of our Class A common stock at or above the price you paid in this offering, or at all.
⟦s001685⟧ An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.
⟦s001686⟧ Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters and the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.
⟦s001687⟧ Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we otherwise consent in writing, (i) (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, other employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of 58

⟦s001690⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws (as either may be amended or restated) or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware); and (ii) the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act; provided, however, that the foregoing choice of forum provision shall not apply to claims seeking to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the United States federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.
⟦s001691⟧ The choice of forum provision is limited to the extent permitted by law, and it will not apply to claims brought to enforce any liability or duty arising under the Exchange Act, or for any other federal securities laws which provide for exclusive federal jurisdiction.
⟦s001692⟧ Additionally, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
⟦s001693⟧ Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions.
⟦s001694⟧ Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims.
⟦s001695⟧ To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated bylaws will provide that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.
⟦s001696⟧ While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring such a claim arising under the Securities Act against us, our directors, officers, or other employees in a venue other than in the federal district courts of the United States.
⟦s001697⟧ In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the choice of forum provisions of our amended and restated bylaws.
⟦s001698⟧ The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
⟦s001699⟧ Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001700⟧ Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws.
⟦s001701⟧ If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, or if there is any fluctuation in our credit rating, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
⟦s001702⟧ The trading market for our Class A common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business.
⟦s001703⟧ We do not control these analysts.
⟦s001704⟧ Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on our company.
⟦s001705⟧ If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of our shares would likely be negatively impacted.
⟦s001706⟧ Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline.
⟦s001707⟧ If one or more of these analysts stops covering us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which, in turn, could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
⟦s001708⟧ Additionally, any fluctuation in the credit rating of us or our subsidiaries may impact our ability to access debt markets in the future or increase our cost of future debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition, which in return, may adversely affect the trading price of shares of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001709⟧ If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
⟦s001710⟧ The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this prospectus.
⟦s001711⟧ We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other 59
⟦s001712⟧ End Page 71
⟦s001713⟧ Begin Page 72
⟦s001714⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Critical accounting policies and estimates.
⟦s001715⟧ ” The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses.
⟦s001716⟧ Significant estimates and judgments involve: revenue recognition, including revenue-related reserves; legal contingencies; valuation of our Class A common stock and equity awards; income taxes; and sales and indirect tax reserves.
⟦s001717⟧ Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001718⟧ Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market following this offering could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.
⟦s001719⟧ After this offering, the sale of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001720⟧ These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.
⟦s001721⟧ Upon consummation of the Transactions, we will have outstanding a total of 7,692,308 shares of Class A common stock.
⟦s001722⟧ Of the outstanding shares, the 7,692,308 shares sold in this offering (or 8,846,154 shares if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock) will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, other than any shares held by our affiliates.
⟦s001723⟧ Any shares of Class A common stock held by our affiliates will be eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, subject to the volume, manner of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144.
⟦s001724⟧ Our directors and executive officers, and substantially all of our stockholders, will enter into lock-up agreements with the underwriters prior to the commencement of this offering pursuant to which each of these persons or entities, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the sale of the shares of our Class A common stock and certain other securities held by them for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus.
⟦s001725⟧ J.
⟦s001726⟧ P.
⟦s001727⟧ Morgan Securities LLC and BofA Securities, Inc. may, in their sole discretion and at any time, release all or any portion of the shares or securities subject to any such lock-up agreements.
⟦s001728⟧ See “Underwriting (conflicts of interest).
⟦s001729⟧ ” In addition, we have reserved shares of Class A common stock for issuance under the 2024 Plan.
⟦s001730⟧ Any Class A common stock that we issue under the 2024 Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future would dilute the percentage ownership held by the investors who purchase Class A common stock in this offering.
⟦s001731⟧ As restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights, the market price of our shares of Class A common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.
⟦s001732⟧ These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of Class A common stock or other securities.
⟦s001733⟧ In the future, we may also issue securities in connection with investments, acquisitions, or capital raising activities.
⟦s001734⟧ In particular, the number of shares of our Class A common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition, or to raise additional equity capital, could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001735⟧ Any such issuance of additional securities in the future may result in additional dilution to you or may adversely impact the price of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001736⟧ If you purchase shares of Class A common stock in this offering, you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of your investment.
⟦s001737⟧ The initial public offering price of our Class A common stock is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001738⟧ Therefore, if you purchase shares of our Class A common stock in this offering, you will pay a price per share that substantially exceeds our net tangible book value per share after this offering.
⟦s001739⟧ You will experience immediate dilution of $14.
⟦s001740⟧ 03 per share, representing the difference between our net tangible book value per share after giving effect to this offering and the initial public offering price.
⟦s001741⟧ In addition, investors who purchase Class A common stock from us in this offering will have contributed 96.

⟦s001748⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS We have broad discretion to use the proceeds from this offering, and our investment of those proceeds may not yield a favorable return.
⟦s001749⟧ Our management has broad discretion to spend the proceeds from this offering in ways with which you may not agree.
⟦s001750⟧ See “Use of proceeds” and “Certain relationships and related person transactions.
⟦s001751⟧ ” The failure of our management to apply these funds effectively could result in unfavorable returns.
⟦s001752⟧ This could harm our business and could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.
⟦s001753⟧ General risk factors We are subject to litigation, arbitration, or other claims which could materially and adversely affect us.
⟦s001754⟧ We are subject to litigation, and we may in the future be subject to enforcement actions, such as claims relating to our operations, securities offerings, and otherwise in the ordinary course of business.
⟦s001755⟧ Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs and potentially significant judgments against us, some of which are not, or cannot be, insured against.
⟦s001756⟧ Although we have established warranty, claim, and litigation reserves that we believe are adequate, we cannot be certain of the ultimate outcomes of any claims that may arise in the future, and legal proceedings may result in the award of substantial damages against us beyond our reserves.
⟦s001757⟧ Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in our having to pay significant fines, judgments, or settlements, which, if uninsured or in excess of insured levels, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows, thereby materially and adversely affecting us.
⟦s001758⟧ Furthermore, plaintiffs may, in certain of these legal proceedings, seek class action status with potential class sizes that vary from case to case.
⟦s001759⟧ Class action lawsuits can be costly to defend, and if we were to lose any certified class action suit, it could result in substantial liability for us.
⟦s001760⟧ Certain litigation or the resolution thereof may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could materially and adversely impact us, expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured, and materially and adversely impact our ability to attract directors and officers.
⟦s001761⟧ We may suffer uninsured losses or material losses in excess of insurance limits.
⟦s001762⟧ We could suffer physical damage to property and liabilities resulting in losses that may not be fully recoverable by insurance.
⟦s001763⟧ Insurance against certain types of risks, such as terrorism, earthquakes, floods, or personal injury claims, may be unavailable, available in amounts that are less than the full market value or replacement cost of investment or underlying assets or subject to a large deductible or self-insurance retention amount.
⟦s001764⟧ In addition, there can be no assurance that certain types of risks that are currently insurable will continue to be insurable on an economically feasible basis.
⟦s001765⟧ Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur or be subject to deductibles or self-insurance retention, we could sustain financial loss or lose capital invested in the affected property, as well as anticipated future income from that property.
⟦s001766⟧ Furthermore, we could be liable to repair damage or meet liabilities caused by risks that are uninsured or subject to deductibles.
⟦s001767⟧ We may also be liable for any debt or other financial obligations related to affected property.
⟦s001768⟧ Acts of war or terrorism may seriously harm our business.
⟦s001769⟧ Acts of war, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the United States and any foreign power, or acts of terrorism may cause disruption to the U.

⟦s001771⟧ economy, or the local economies of the markets in which we operate, cause shortages of building materials, increase costs associated with obtaining building materials, result in building code changes that could increase costs of construction, result in uninsured losses, affect job growth and consumer confidence, or cause economic changes that we cannot anticipate, all of which could reduce demand for our homes and adversely impact our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001772⟧ Negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation as well as our business, financial results, and stock price.
⟦s001773⟧ Unfavorable media related to our industry, company, brands, marketing, personnel, operations, business performance, or prospects may affect our stock price and the performance of our business, regardless of its accuracy or inaccuracy.
⟦s001774⟧ The speed at which negative publicity can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of electronic communication, including social media outlets, websites, blogs, newsletters, and other digital platforms.
⟦s001775⟧ Our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to this rapidly changing media environment.
⟦s001776⟧ Adverse publicity or negative commentary from any media outlets could damage our reputation and reduce the demand for our homes, which would adversely affect our business.

⟦s001780⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Changes in accounting rules, assumptions, and/or judgments could materially and adversely affect us.
⟦s001781⟧ Accounting rules and interpretations for certain aspects of our financial reporting are highly complex and involve significant assumptions and judgment.
⟦s001782⟧ These complexities could lead to a delay in the preparation and dissemination of our financial statements.
⟦s001783⟧ Furthermore, changes in accounting rules and interpretations or in our accounting assumptions and/or judgments, such as those related to asset impairments, could significantly impact our financial statements.
⟦s001784⟧ In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in restating prior period financial statements.
⟦s001785⟧ Any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001786⟧ Access to financing sources may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, especially in light of current market conditions, which could adversely affect our ability to maximize our returns.
⟦s001787⟧ Our access to additional third-party sources of financing will depend, in part, on: • general market conditions, including inflation and rising interest rates; • the market’s perception of our growth potential; • with respect to acquisition and/or development financing, the market’s perception of the value of the land parcels to be acquired and/or developed; • our current debt levels; • our current and expected future earnings; • our cash flow; and • the market price per share of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001788⟧ The global credit and equity markets and the overall economy can be extremely volatile, which could have a number of adverse effects on our operations and capital requirements.
⟦s001789⟧ For the past decade, the domestic financial markets have experienced a high degree of volatility, uncertainty and, during certain periods, tightening of liquidity in both the high yield debt and equity capital markets, resulting in certain periods when new capital has been both more difficult and more expensive to access.
⟦s001790⟧ If we are unable to access the credit markets, we could be required to defer or eliminate important business strategies and growth opportunities in the future.
⟦s001791⟧ In addition, if there is prolonged volatility and weakness in the capital and credit markets, potential lenders may be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing that is attractive to us or may increase collateral requirements or may charge us prohibitively high fees in order to obtain financing.
⟦s001792⟧ Consequently, our ability to access the credit market in order to attract financing on reasonable terms may be adversely affected.
⟦s001793⟧ Investment returns on our assets and our ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected by our inability to secure additional financing on reasonable terms, if at all.
⟦s001794⟧ Depending on market conditions at the relevant time, we may have to rely more heavily on additional equity financings or on less efficient forms of debt financing that require a larger portion of our cash flow from operations, thereby reducing funds available for our operations, future business opportunities and other purposes.
⟦s001795⟧ We may not have access to such equity or debt capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all.
⟦s001796⟧ The failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could reduce the amount of cash we have available to pay distributions and make additional investments.
⟦s001797⟧ The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation only insures amounts up to $250,000 per depositor.
⟦s001798⟧ We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.
⟦s001799⟧ S.
⟦s001800⟧ financial institutions, and our deposits at certain of these institutions may exceed insured limits from time to time.
⟦s001801⟧ Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions, as we have seen recently with the abrupt failure of more than one regional bank.
⟦s001802⟧ Although we did not experience any loss related to these failures, if any of the banking institutions in which we deposit funds ultimately fails, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all.
⟦s001803⟧ The loss of our deposits could reduce the amount of cash we have available to distribute or invest and could result in a decline in the value of our stockholders’ investment.

⟦s001807⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS We may change our operational policies, investment guidelines and our business and growth strategies without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different and more significant risks in the future.
⟦s001808⟧ Our board of directors will determine our operational policies, investment guidelines, and business and growth strategies.
⟦s001809⟧ Our board of directors may make changes to, or approve transactions that deviate from, those policies, guidelines, and strategies without a vote of, or notice to, our stockholders.
⟦s001810⟧ This could result in us conducting operational matters, making investments, or pursuing different business or growth strategies than those contemplated in this prospectus.
⟦s001811⟧ Under any of these circumstances, we may expose ourselves to different and more significant risks in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
⟦s001812⟧ Future offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our Class A common stock upon our bankruptcy or liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities that may be senior to our Class A common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidation distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001813⟧ In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt securities or additional offerings of equity securities.
⟦s001814⟧ Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001815⟧ Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our Class A common stock, or both.
⟦s001816⟧ Our preferred stock will have a preference on liquidating distributions and dividend payments, which could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our Class A common stock.
⟦s001817⟧ Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control.
⟦s001818⟧ As a result, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings, and purchasers of our Class A common stock in this offering bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our Class A common stock and diluting their ownership interest in our company.

⟦s001884⟧ Our corporate structure following this offering, as described below, is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership-C corporation (“Up-C”) structure, which is often used by partnerships and limited liability companies when they undertake an initial public offering of their business.

⟦s001886⟧ S.
⟦s001887⟧ federal income tax purposes following the offering.
⟦s001888⟧ Investors in this offering will, by contrast, hold their equity ownership in Smith Douglas Homes Corp., a Delaware corporation that is a domestic corporation for U.
⟦s001889⟧ S.
⟦s001890⟧ federal income tax purposes, in the form of shares of Class A common stock.
⟦s001891⟧ One of the tax benefits to the Continuing Equity Owners associated with this structure is that future taxable income of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC that is allocated to the Continuing Equity Owners will be taxed on a flow-through basis and therefore will not be subject to corporate taxes at the entity level.
⟦s001892⟧ Additionally, because the Continuing Equity Owners may have their LLC Interests redeemed by Smith Douglas Holdings LLC (or at our option, directly exchanged by Smith Douglas Homes Corp.) for newly issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to customary adjustments, including for stock splits, stock dividends, and reclassifications) or, at our option, for cash, the Up-C 67

⟦s001895⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS structure also provides the Continuing Equity Owners with potential liquidity that holders of non-publicly traded limited liability companies are not typically afforded.
⟦s001896⟧ In connection with any such redemption or exchange of LLC Interests, a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock held by the relevant Continuing Equity Owner will automatically be transferred to Smith Douglas Homes Corp. for no consideration and be canceled.
⟦s001897⟧ The Continuing Equity Owners and Smith Douglas Homes Corp. also each expect to benefit from the Up-C structure as a result of certain cash tax savings arising from redemptions or exchanges of the Continuing Equity Owner’s LLC Interests for Class A common stock or cash, and certain other tax benefits covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement discussed in “Certain relationships and related person transactions—Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s001898⟧ ” See “Risk factors—Risks related to our organizational structure.
⟦s001899⟧ ” In general, the Continuing Equity Owners expect to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement of 85% of the amount of certain tax benefits, as described below, and Smith Douglas Homes Corp. expects to benefit in the form of cash tax savings in amounts equal to 15% of certain tax benefits, as described below.
⟦s001900⟧ Any payments made by us to the Continuing Equity Owners under the Tax Receivable Agreement will reduce cash otherwise arising from such tax savings.
⟦s001901⟧ We expect such payments will be substantial.
⟦s001902⟧ As described below under “Certain relationships and related person transactions—Tax Receivable Agreement,” prior to the completion of this offering, we will enter into a tax receivable agreement with Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and the Continuing Equity Owners that will provide for the payment by Smith Douglas Homes Corp. to the Continuing Equity Owners of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that Smith Douglas Homes Corp. actually realizes (or in some circumstances is deemed to realize) as a result of (i) Basis Adjustments, (ii) Section 704(c) Allocations, and (iii) certain tax benefits (such as interest deductions) arising from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement.

⟦s001914⟧ ” Reclassification and amendment and restatement of the Smith Douglas LLC Agreement Prior to the consummation of this offering, the existing limited liability company agreement of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC will be amended and restated to, among other things, recapitalize its capital structure by creating a single new class of units, or the common units or the LLC interests, and provide for a right of redemption of common units in exchange for, at our election (determined solely by our independent directors (within the meaning of the Exchange rules), who are disinterested), shares of our Class A common stock or cash provided that, at our election (determined solely by our independent directors (within the meaning of the Exchange rules) who are disinterested), we may effect a direct exchange by Smith Douglas Homes Corp. of such Class A common stock or such cash, as applicable, for such LLC Interests.

⟦s001923⟧ 4 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock), after deducting the underwriting discount.
⟦s001924⟧ We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to: (i) purchase 6,410,257 newly issued LLC Interests for approximately $116.
⟦s001925⟧ 3 million directly from Smith Douglas Holdings LLC at a price per unit equal to the initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock in this offering less the underwriting discount; and (ii) purchase 1,282,051 LLC Interests from the Continuing Equity Owners on a pro rata basis for $23.
⟦s001926⟧ 2 million in aggregate (or 2,435,897 LLC Interests from the Continuing Equity Owners for $44.
⟦s001927⟧ 2 million in aggregate if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock) at a price per unit equal to the initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock in this offering less the underwriting discount).
⟦s001928⟧ Upon each purchase of LLC Interests, the corresponding shares of Class B common stock will automatically be transferred to Smith Douglas Homes Corp. for no consideration and be canceled.
⟦s001929⟧ We will only retain the net proceeds that are used to purchase newly issued LLC Interests from Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, which, in turn, Smith Douglas Holdings LLC intends to use as follows: (i) to repay approximately $71.
⟦s001930⟧ 0 million of borrowings outstanding under our Existing Credit Facility as part of the Refinancing (see “Underwriting (conflicts of interest)”), (ii) redeem all outstanding Class C Units and Class D Units of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC at par aggregating $2.
⟦s001931⟧ 6 million, (iii) repay $1.
⟦s001932⟧ 2 million in notes payable to related parties and (iv) the remainder, if any, for general corporate purposes as described herein and under “Certain relationships and related person transactions.
⟦s001933⟧ ” As of September 30, 2023, outstanding borrowings under the Existing Credit Facility aggregated $71.
⟦s001934⟧ 0 million with no outstanding letters of credit.
⟦s001935⟧ Borrowings under the Existing Credit Facility bear interest at the Prime Rate plus the applicable margin, as defined therein, based on our leverage ratio and payable monthly (an effective rate of 8.
⟦s001936⟧ 25% as of September 30, 2023).
⟦s001937⟧ The maturity, among other provisions, under the Existing Credit Facility will be amended and restated by the Amended Credit Facility.
⟦s001938⟧ Following this offering and the Refinancing, we will have $250.

⟦s001941⟧ ” We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services, or technologies; however, we do not have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or investments at this time.
⟦s001942⟧ This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve.
⟦s001943⟧ We cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above.
⟦s001944⟧ As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.
⟦s001945⟧ Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this prospectus.
⟦s001946⟧ We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.
⟦s001947⟧ We may satisfy our future cash needs through the sale of equity securities, debt financings, working capital lines of credit, corporate collaborations, or license agreements, grant funding, interest income earned on invested cash balances or a combination of one or more of these sources.
⟦s001948⟧ We could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect, in which case we would need to obtain additional funding, which may not be available to use on acceptable terms, or at all.
⟦s001949⟧ Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.
⟦s001950⟧ Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term and intermediate-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments, and U.

⟦s001995⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Dividend policy We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business, and therefore we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future.
⟦s001996⟧ Except in certain limited circumstances, holders of our Class B common stock are not entitled to participate in any dividends declared by our board of directors.
⟦s001997⟧ Furthermore, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock depends on our receipt of cash distributions from Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s001998⟧ Our Existing Credit Facility and our Amended Credit Facility contain certain covenants that restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to pay dividends.
⟦s001999⟧ See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation—Liquidity and capital resources—Existing Credit Facility” and “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Liquidity and capital resources—Amended Credit Facility.
⟦s002000⟧ ” Our ability to pay dividends may be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of us.
⟦s002001⟧ See “Description of capital stock” and “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation—Liquidity and capital resources.
⟦s002002⟧ ” Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to the requirements of applicable law, compliance with contractual restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our future indebtedness.
⟦s002003⟧ Any such determination will also depend upon our business prospects, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and availability and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.
⟦s002004⟧ Accordingly, you may need to sell your shares of our Class A common stock to realize a return on your investment, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.
⟦s002005⟧ See “Risk factors—Risks related to this offering and ownership of our Class A common stock—Because we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our Class A common stock following this offering, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.
⟦s002006⟧ ” Immediately following this offering, we will be a holding company, and our principal asset will be the LLC Interests we purchase from Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and from each Continuing Equity Owner.
⟦s002007⟧ If we decide to pay a dividend in the future, we would need to cause Smith Douglas Holdings LLC to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to cover such dividend.
⟦s002008⟧ If Smith Douglas Holdings LLC makes such distributions to us, the other holders of LLC Interests will be entitled to receive pro rata distributions.
⟦s002009⟧ See “Risk factors—Risks related to our organizational structure—Our principal asset after the completion of this offering will be our interest in Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, and, as a result, we will depend on distributions from Smith Douglas Holdings LLC to pay our taxes and expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.

⟦s002014⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Dilution The Continuing Equity Owners will own LLC Interests after the Transactions.
⟦s002015⟧ Because the Continuing Equity Owners do not own any Class A common stock or have any right to receive distributions or dividends from Smith Douglas Homes Corp., we have presented dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share both before and after this offering assuming that all of the holders of LLC Interests (other than Smith Douglas Homes Corp.) had their LLC Interests redeemed or exchanged for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis (rather than for cash) and the transfer to us and cancellation for no consideration of all of their shares of Class B common stock (which are not entitled to receive distributions or dividends, whether cash or stock from Smith Douglas Homes Corp).
⟦s002016⟧ In order to more meaningfully present the dilutive impact on the investors in this offering.
⟦s002017⟧ We refer to the assumed redemption or exchange of all LLC Interests for shares of Class A common stock as described in the previous sentence as the “Assumed Redemption.
⟦s002018⟧ ” Dilution is the amount by which the offering price paid by the purchasers of the Class A common stock in this offering exceeds the pro forma net tangible book value per share of Class A common stock after the offering.
⟦s002019⟧ Smith Douglas Holdings Corp.’s pro forma net tangible book value as of September 30, 2023 prior to this offering and after giving effect to the recapitalization transaction and the Assumed Redemption was $171.
⟦s002020⟧ 3 million.
⟦s002021⟧ Pro forma net tangible book value per share prior to this offering is determined by subtracting our total liabilities from the total book value of our tangible assets and dividing the difference by the number of shares of Class A common stock deemed to be outstanding after giving effect to the Assumed Redemption.
⟦s002022⟧ If you invest in our Class A common stock in this offering, your ownership interest will be immediately diluted to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price per share and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Class A common stock after this offering.
⟦s002023⟧ Pro forma net tangible book value per share after this offering is determined by subtracting our total liabilities from the total book value of our tangible assets and dividing the difference by the number of shares of Class A common stock deemed to be outstanding, after giving effect to the Transactions, including this offering and the application of the proceeds from this offering as described in “Use of proceeds”, and the Assumed Redemption.
⟦s002024⟧ Our pro forma net tangible book value as of September 30, 2023, after giving effect to this offering would have been approximately $280.
⟦s002025⟧ 4 million, or $5.
⟦s002026⟧ 47 per share of Class A common stock.
⟦s002027⟧ This amount represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value of $1.
⟦s002028⟧ 65 per share to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution in pro forma net tangible book value of $14.
⟦s002029⟧ 03 per share to new investors purchasing shares of Class A common stock in this offering.
⟦s002030⟧ We determine dilution by subtracting the pro forma net tangible book value per share after this offering from the amount of cash that a new investor paid for a share of Class A common stock.

⟦s002085⟧ As a public company, we will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies.
⟦s002086⟧ We expect to incur additional annual expenses related to these steps and, among other things, additional directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, director fees, costs for reporting requirements of the SEC, transfer agent fees, costs for hiring additional accounting, legal, and administrative personnel, increased auditing and legal expenses, and other related costs.
⟦s002087⟧ Due to the scope and complexity of these activities, the amount of these costs would be based on subjective estimates and assumptions that could not be factually supported.
⟦s002088⟧ We have not included any pro forma adjustments related to these costs.
⟦s002089⟧ The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is provided for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred if the Transactions and the Devon Street Homes Acquisition, had been completed as of the dates set forth above, nor is it indicative of our future results.
⟦s002090⟧ The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information should be read together with “Our organizational structure,” “Capitalization,” “Use of proceeds,” “Summary historical and pro forma condensed consolidated financial and other data,” “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,” and our historical financial statements and related notes of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries, Smith Douglas Homes Corp., and Devon Street Homes, each included elsewhere in this prospectus.

⟦s002122⟧ Although we will have a minority economic interest in Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, we will have the sole voting interest in, and control of, the business and affairs of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s002123⟧ As a result, we will consolidate Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and record a significant non-controlling interest in equity in our consolidated financial statements for the economic interest in Smith Douglas Holdings LLC held directly or indirectly by the Continuing Equity Owners.
⟦s002124⟧ Under U.
⟦s002125⟧ S.
⟦s002126⟧ GAAP, since the members of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC prior to the exchange will continue to hold a controlling interest in Smith Douglas Holdings LLC after the exchange (i.e.
⟦s002127⟧ , there was no change in control of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC) and since Smith Douglas Homes Corp. is considered a “shell company” which does not meet the definition of a business, the financial statements of the consolidated entity represent a continuation of the financial position and results of operations of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s002128⟧ Accordingly, the historical cost basis of assets, liabilities, capital, and accumulated earnings of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC are carried over to the consolidated financial statements of the merged company as a common control transaction.
⟦s002129⟧ Also, after consummation of this offering, Smith Douglas Homes Corp. will become subject to U.

⟦s002162⟧ (2) The contingent consideration represents management’s preliminary estimate of the fair value of the future payment to be made to the former owner of Devon Street Homes under the terms of the Gross Margin Earnout feature included in the executed APA for the Devon Street Homes Acquisition.
⟦s002163⟧ Per the terms of the Gross Margin Earnout feature, the seller is entitled to receive a one time payment in the first quarter of 2025 based on the newly established Houston division’s gross margin (as defined) for the year ending December 31, 2024.
⟦s002164⟧ The payout will be determined in accordance with the Gross Margin Calculation Payout Grid and ranges from a minimum of zero to a maximum of $5.
⟦s002165⟧ 0 million.
⟦s002166⟧ We accounted for the Devon Street Homes Acquisition as a business combination, which requires us to record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the Acquisition Date.
⟦s002167⟧ The preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which are presented in the table below, and the related preliminary acquisition accounting, are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as information compiled by management, including the books and records of Devon Street Homes, as of the date these financial statements were available to be issued.
⟦s002168⟧ We believe that the information gathered to date provides a reasonable basis for estimating the preliminary fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
⟦s002169⟧ Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change during the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the Acquisition Date.
⟦s002170⟧ Any potential adjustments made could be material in relation to the values presented in the table below.

⟦s002173⟧ We will continue to evaluate these items until they are satisfactorily resolved and adjust our acquisition accounting accordingly within the allowable measurement period (not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition), as defined by ASC 805.

⟦s002303⟧ See “Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements.
⟦s002304⟧ ” Company overview We are one of the nation’s fastest growing private homebuilders by number of closings and are engaged in the design, construction, and sale of single-family homes in some of the highest growth and most desirable markets in the Southeastern and Southern United States.
⟦s002305⟧ We employ an efficient land-light, production focused, and conservatively leveraged business model, which we believe results in a compelling combination of strong home closing gross margins, construction cycle times, and returns.
⟦s002306⟧ Our communities are primarily targeted to entry-level and empty-nest homebuyers.
⟦s002307⟧ We offer our homebuyers an attractive value proposition by providing a personalized home buying experience at affordable price points.
⟦s002308⟧ With the goal of becoming one of the most dominant homebuilders in the Southeastern and Southern United States, we intend to grow operations within our existing footprint and to expand into new markets where we can most effectively implement our business strategy and maximize our profit and returns.
⟦s002309⟧ The homebuilding industry witnessed exceptional growth throughout the second half of 2020 and the entirety of 2021.
⟦s002310⟧ This expansion persisted into the first quarter of 2022.
⟦s002311⟧ However, the market gradually weakened for the remainder of 2022 as interest rates rapidly increased, cooling demand significantly during the latter half of the year.
⟦s002312⟧ Homebuyer hesitancy arose due to affordability constraints, uncertainty surrounding future interest rates and inflation levels, and a deteriorating general economy.
⟦s002313⟧ Consequently, there was a notable decline in housing demand across the country.
⟦s002314⟧ Despite these economic conditions exerting downward pressure on the housing market, we still achieved a slight increase in our net new home orders to 1,928 for the year ended December 31, 2022, from 1,920 net new home orders in 2021.
⟦s002315⟧ The first half of 2023 saw an increase in new home demand compared to the latter half of 2022 primarily driven by historically low levels of housing inventory.
⟦s002316⟧ However, the continued rise in interest rates has hampered affordability.
⟦s002317⟧ Despite the rise in rates, our net new orders increased by 22.
⟦s002318⟧ 6% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period a year ago.
⟦s002319⟧ We expect the housing undersupply in the resale market and favorable demographic trends to provide a strong, long-term runway for future new home buying demand.
⟦s002320⟧ We believe our dedication to entry-level and empty-nest homebuyers with a focus on price points that fall below FHA guidelines, our efficient construction process, and our affordable luxury sales experience caters to the desires of today’s aspiring homeowners and is resilient across economic cycles.
⟦s002321⟧ We believe our focus on affordable luxury will continue to serve us well as we remain optimistic about long-term demand due to favorable homebuyer demographics.
⟦s002322⟧ Additionally, we construct most of our homes on a pre-sold basis, where our homebuyers choose their homes based on a select number of value-engineered floor plans and are offered flexibility on the selection of home options.
⟦s002323⟧ The SMART Builder system and Rteam process allows this optionality for homebuyers based on just-in-time modifications.
⟦s002324⟧ As a result of our differentiated value proposition and efficient construction cycle times, we believe we typically achieve a high level of homebuyer satisfaction and experience low cancellation rates, which were 9% and 11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively.
⟦s002325⟧ At the core of our land-light operating strategy lies the principle and discipline of primarily acquiring finished lots from a diverse pool of third-party land developers or land bankers through the effective utilization of lot-option contracts.
⟦s002326⟧ Our lot acquisition strategy reduces our upfront capital requirements and generally provides for “just-in-time” lot delivery, better aligning our pace of home orders and home starts.

⟦s002331⟧ As of September 30, 2023, we had 395 owned unstarted lots in real estate inventory on our balance sheet which represented only 3.
⟦s002332⟧ 4% of our total controlled lot supply.
⟦s002333⟧ We carefully select the geographic markets that demonstrate strong population and employment growth trends, favorable migration patterns, and desirable lifestyle and weather conditions.
⟦s002334⟧ Our operations are currently organized into six geographical segments; our reportable segments include Atlanta (which includes certain Atlanta suburbs like Dalton, GA), Raleigh, Charlotte, Nashville, Alabama (which consists of both Birmingham and Huntsville), and Houston.
⟦s002335⟧ Each of our markets is experiencing strong momentum in housing demand drivers relative to historic averages, and we believe there is significant opportunity to expand our presence in each of our respective markets.
⟦s002336⟧ We intend to capitalize on our demonstrated operational experience to grow our market share within our existing markets and to opportunistically expand into new markets where we identify strong economic and demographic trends that provide opportunities to build homes that meet our profit and return objectives.
⟦s002337⟧ For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenue of $755.

⟦s002350⟧ Our reportable segments include Atlanta (which includes certain Atlanta suburbs like Dalton, GA), Raleigh, Charlotte, Nashville, Alabama (which consists of both Birmingham and Huntsville), and Houston.
⟦s002351⟧ Key factors affecting our performance We believe our future performance will depend on many factors, including those described below and in the sections titled “Risk factors” and “Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements” included elsewhere in this prospectus.
⟦s002352⟧ Availability of finished lots The availability of finished lots in the markets where we operate is significantly influenced by a number of factors generally beyond our control including, among other things, the cooperation and pricing of land sellers, governmental constraints and regulations on the development of land, and the ability to contract for the timely development of lots to meet demand.
⟦s002353⟧ Additionally, competition for available finished lots and prevailing market conditions play a crucial role in our ability to build and deliver homes to our homebuyers.
⟦s002354⟧ When the supply of finished lots is constrained due to these factors or others, it may lead to a decrease in the number of homes we can build and sell.
⟦s002355⟧ If we encounter challenges in acquiring finished lots at competitive prices or encounter difficulties in securing them altogether, it could have adverse effects on our revenues, margins, and overall operational outcomes.
⟦s002356⟧ We typically aim to control up to a five-year supply of lots, subject to market conditions.
⟦s002357⟧ As of September 30, 2023, we controlled 11,579 lots which, based on our home closings for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023 of 2,268, equals a 5.
⟦s002358⟧ 1-year supply.
⟦s002359⟧ Construction costs Our cost of home closings includes the construction costs of the home, the lot cost for the home, interest costs capitalized during the construction period until substantial completion, warranty costs for the home, indirect construction costs, and closing costs applicable to the home.
⟦s002360⟧ In general, the cost of building materials fluctuates with overall trends in the underlying prices of raw materials.
⟦s002361⟧ The cost of certain of our building materials, such as lumber and oil-based products, fluctuates with market-based pricing curves.
⟦s002362⟧ We often obtain volume discounts and/or rebates with certain suppliers of our building materials, which in turn reduces our cost of sales.
⟦s002363⟧ However, increases in the cost of building materials may negatively impact our cost of sales and, in turn, our home closing gross margin and net income to the extent market conditions prevent the recovery of increased costs through higher home order prices.

⟦s002366⟧ Begin Page 102
⟦s002367⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Changes in liquidity and land bank financing To effectively manage the acquisition and control of finished lots, we typically enter into lot-option agreements with third-party land bankers or land developers.
⟦s002368⟧ This financing strategy aligns with our land-light approach, minimizing the need for substantial upfront capital and facilitating a steady flow of lots that correspond to our home orders and construction pace.
⟦s002369⟧ By adopting this lot acquisition strategy, we mitigate the inherent risks associated with direct land ownership and land development.
⟦s002370⟧ Furthermore, it reduces our balance sheet exposure in comparison to other homebuilders who retain a larger proportion of their land supply.
⟦s002371⟧ While this approach allows us to maintain flexibility and help mitigate potential risks associated with financing and developing land, the recent challenges faced by regional banks may impact the ability of our third-party land bankers and land developers to secure financing and thereby impact our ability to maximize our land-light business model.
⟦s002372⟧ As of September 30, 2023, approximately 23% of our controlled lots were under option with our land bank partners while approximately 77% of lots were under option with traditional land sellers and developer partners.
⟦s002373⟧ Availability of mortgages; applicable interest rates In 2022, approximately 95.
⟦s002374⟧ 0% of our homebuyers utilized mortgages to purchase their homes.
⟦s002375⟧ The availability of affordable mortgage options for a wide range of consumers has a substantial impact on our business.
⟦s002376⟧ However, the accessibility of mortgages is influenced by factors beyond our control, such as prevailing interest rates and down payment requirements.
⟦s002377⟧ For instance, the significant increase in interest rates implemented by The Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023 has elevated our financing costs and those of our homebuyers.
⟦s002378⟧ Moreover, many of our homebuyers who obtain mortgages opt for loans that adhere to the terms set by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.
⟦s002379⟧ These entities purchase or insure mortgage loans and securities backed by them, which directly impacts the interest rates available to homebuyers with conforming loans.
⟦s002380⟧ Additionally, the federal government’s involvement in insuring mortgage loans through entities like the FHA, VA, and USDA holds particular importance in the mortgage finance industry and our business.
⟦s002381⟧ While our homes typically fall below FHA limits, adjustments made by these entities, such as raising down payment requirements or lowering maximum loan amounts, could have a material impact on our operations.
⟦s002382⟧ Disruptions in this mortgage supply chain can significantly affect our business if our homebuyers encounter difficulties in securing acceptable mortgage terms or face challenges in obtaining mortgages altogether.
⟦s002383⟧ Seasonality In all of our markets, we have historically experienced similar variability in our results of operations and capital requirements from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding industry.
⟦s002384⟧ We generally close more homes and record higher sales in our second, third, and fourth quarters.
⟦s002385⟧ As a result, our revenue may fluctuate on a quarterly basis, and we may have higher capital requirements in our second, third, and fourth quarters in order to maintain our inventory levels.
⟦s002386⟧ Our revenue and capital requirements are generally similar across our second, third, and fourth quarters.
⟦s002387⟧ As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular quarter, especially the first quarter, are not necessarily representative of the results we expect for the year.
⟦s002388⟧ We expect this seasonal pattern to continue in the long term.
⟦s002389⟧ Macroeconomic factors Commencing in the first half of 2022, we began to see certain macroeconomic trends that affected our markets and industry such as higher inflation, rising interest rates and associated decreases in consumer discretionary income, the effects of supply chain challenges, declining government stimulus following the COVID-19 pandemic, and uncertainty regarding an economic recession.
⟦s002390⟧ Despite the broader macroeconomic challenges, we have observed an increase in demand from entry-level and empty-nest homebuyers, and we expect the housing market in the Southeastern United States to remain healthy given supply dynamics.
⟦s002391⟧ Any worsening of macroeconomic conditions in future periods could have a negative effect on our financial results.

⟦s002416⟧ Devon Street Homes Acquisition On July 31, 2023, we consummated the Devon Street Homes Acquisition by acquiring substantially all of the assets of Devon Street Homes pursuant to the APA.
⟦s002417⟧ The purchase price equaled the net assets of Devon Street Homes on a cash-free, debt-free basis, plus an agreed upon premium which is comprised primarily of real estate inventory, subject to purchase price adjustments.
⟦s002418⟧ We funded the purchase price of $82.

⟦s002433⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Our interim financial statements as of September 30, 2023, include the results of operations of Devon Street Homes for the period between July 31, 2023, when the acquisition was consummated, and September 30, 2023.
⟦s002434⟧ As a result our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 may not be directly comparable to prior periods.
⟦s002435⟧ See “Unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information” in this prospectus for additional information.
⟦s002436⟧ Non-GAAP financial measures In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we have provided information in this prospectus relating to “adjusted home closing gross profit,” “adjusted home closing gross margin,” “adjusted net income,” “EBITDA” and “EBITDA margin.
⟦s002437⟧ ” We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance.
⟦s002438⟧ We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP.
⟦s002439⟧ However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with additional useful information in evaluating our performance and to more readily compare these financial measures between past and future periods.
⟦s002440⟧ There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this prospectus.
⟦s002441⟧ For example, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
⟦s002442⟧ Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
⟦s002443⟧ Adjusted home closing gross profit and adjusted home closing gross margin Adjusted home closing gross profit and adjusted home closing gross margin are non-GAAP financial measures used by management as supplemental measures in evaluating operating performance.
⟦s002444⟧ We define adjusted home closing gross profit as home closing revenue less cost of home closings, excluding capitalized interest charged to cost of home closings, impairment charges and adjustments resulting from the application of purchase accounting included in cost of sales, if applicable.
⟦s002445⟧ We define adjusted home closing gross margin as adjusted home closing gross profit as a percentage of home closing revenue.
⟦s002446⟧ Management believes this information is meaningful because it isolates the impact that capitalized interest has on home closing gross margin.
⟦s002447⟧ However, because adjusted home closing gross profit and adjusted home closing gross margin information excludes capitalized interest, which has real economic effects and could impact our results of operations, the utility of adjusted home closing gross profit and adjusted home closing gross margin information as a measure of our operating performance may be limited.
⟦s002448⟧ In addition, other companies may not calculate adjusted home closing gross profit and adjusted home closing margin information in the same manner we do.
⟦s002449⟧ Accordingly, adjusted home closing gross profit and adjusted home closing gross margin information should be considered only as a supplement to home closing gross profit and home closing gross margin information as a measure of our performance.
⟦s002450⟧ The following tables present a reconciliation of adjusted home closing gross profit and adjusted home closing gross margin to the GAAP financial measure of home closing gross profit and home closing gross margin for each of the periods indicated: Nine months ended September 30, (Unaudited, in thousands, except percentages) ​ ​ Smith Douglas Homes Corp. pro forma (1) ​ ​ Historical Smith Douglas Holdings LLC ​ 2023 ​ ​ 2023 ​ ​ 2022 Home closing revenue ​ ​ $ ​ 594,591 ​ ​ $ ​ 547,304 ​ ​ $ ​ 531,944 Cost of home closings ​ ​ 426,136 ​ ​ 388,983 ​ ​ 377,341 Home closing gross profit (2) ​ ​ $168,455 ​ ​ $ ​ 158,321 ​ ​ $ ​ 154,603 Capitalized interest charged to cost of home closings ​ ​ 1,715 ​ ​ 1,502 ​ ​ $ ​ 1,841 Adj.

⟦s002465⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Our adjusted home closing gross profit and adjusted home closing gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, decreased, primarily as a result of increased discounts and seller paid closing costs primarily due to a rise in mortgage rates.

⟦s002477⟧ (3) Calculated as a percentage of home closing revenue.
⟦s002478⟧ Our adjusted home closing gross profit and adjusted home closing gross margin increased from 2021 to 2022 primarily as a result of an increase in home closing revenue, an improvement in home closing gross margin as a percentage of home closing revenue, and decreased cost of home closings.
⟦s002479⟧ Adjusted net income Adjusted net income is not a measure of net income or net income margin as determined by GAAP.
⟦s002480⟧ Adjusted net income is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies.
⟦s002481⟧ We define adjusted net income as net income adjusted for the tax impact using our anticipated 25% federal and state blended tax rate (assuming 100% public ownership to adjust for the impact of taxes on earnings attributable to Smith Douglas Holdings LLC as if Smith Douglas Holdings LLC was a subchapter C corporation in the periods presented).
⟦s002482⟧ Management believes adjusted net income is useful because it allows management to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and comparability to industry peers who record income tax expense on their income before tax as opposed to the income of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC not being taxed at the entity level and, therefore, not reflecting a charge against earnings for income tax expense.
⟦s002483⟧ Adjusted net income should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or any other measure as determined in accordance with GAAP.
⟦s002484⟧ Our computation of adjusted net income may not be comparable to adjusted net income of other companies.
⟦s002485⟧ We present adjusted net income because we believe it provides useful information regarding our comparability to peers.
⟦s002486⟧ The following tables present a reconciliation of adjusted net income to the GAAP financial measure of net income for each of the periods indicated (unaudited): Nine months ended September 30, (Unaudited, in thousands, except percentages) ​ ​ Smith Douglas Homes Corp. pro forma (1) ​ ​ Historical Smith Douglas Holdings LLC ​ 2023 ​ ​ 2023 ​ ​ 2022 Net income ​ ​ $93,494 ​ ​ $93,500 ​ ​ $ ​ 99,136 Tax-effected adjustments (1) ​ ​ 20,641 ​ ​ 23,375 ​ ​ 24,784 Adjusted net income ​ ​ $ 72,853 ​ ​ $ ​ 70,125 ​ ​ $ ​ 74,352 (1) For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, our tax expenses assumes an anticipated 25% federal and state blended tax rate (assuming 100% public ownership to adjust for the impact of taxes on earnings attributable to Smith Douglas Holdings LLC as if Smith Douglas Holdings LLC was a subchapter C corporation in the periods presented) 93

⟦s002489⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Our adjusted net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased slightly, as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily as a result of lower home closing gross margin due to increased homebuyer incentives and discounts and increased sales, marketing and commissions offset by an overall increase in home closing revenue and related gross profit.

⟦s002491⟧ 0% increase in home closings, a 22.
⟦s002492⟧ 0% increase in the average sales price of homes closed and a 580 bps increase in home closing gross margin.
⟦s002493⟧ EBITDA and EBITDA margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are not measures of net income or net income margin as determined by GAAP.
⟦s002494⟧ EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies.
⟦s002495⟧ We define EBITDA as net income before (i) interest income, (ii) capitalized interest charged to cost of home closings, (iii) interest expense, (iv) income tax expense, and (v) depreciation.
⟦s002496⟧ We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA as a percentage of home closing revenue.
⟦s002497⟧ Management believes EBITDA and EBITDA margin are useful because they allow management to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare our results of operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure, or other items that impact comparability of financial results from period to period.
⟦s002498⟧ EBITDA and EBITDA margin should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income, net income margin, or any other measure as determined in accordance with GAAP.
⟦s002499⟧ Our computation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin may not be comparable to EBITDA and EBITDA margin of other companies.
⟦s002500⟧ We present EBITDA and EBITDA margin because we believe they provide useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business.

⟦s002524⟧ Our EBITDA and EBITDA margin increased from 2021 to 2022 primarily as a result of an increase in net income.
⟦s002525⟧ Components of results of operations Home closing revenue We recognize revenue when a home closes with a homebuyer and title and possession of the property are transferred to that homebuyer.
⟦s002526⟧ Our performance obligation, to deliver the home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date.
⟦s002527⟧ When we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes such as upgrades or options related to their homes, the cash deposits received are recorded as contract liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled.
⟦s002528⟧ We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts, depending on applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.
⟦s002529⟧ Home closing proceeds are generally received from the title company within a few business days after closing.
⟦s002530⟧ The pace of net new home orders, the ASP, discounts and incentives, and the level of upgrades and options selected by our homebuyer all impact our recognized revenues in a given period.
⟦s002531⟧ Cost of home closings Cost of home closings includes the costs of lot acquisition, development, direct home construction, capitalized interest, closing costs, direct and certain indirect overhead costs and estimated warranty for the homes.
⟦s002532⟧ Estimates of costs incurred or to be incurred but not paid are accrued and expensed at the time of closing.
⟦s002533⟧ We record real estate inventory at cost unless we determine the community to be impaired, at which point we write down the inventory to fair value as required by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment .
⟦s002534⟧ We review our real estate inventory for indicators of potential impairment on a quarterly basis at the community level considering market and economic conditions, current sales absorption rates and recent profitability of new home orders.
⟦s002535⟧ When an indicator of impairment is identified, we prepare and analyze cash flows at the community level on an undiscounted basis.
⟦s002536⟧ If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the community’s carrying value, we generally estimate the fair value using the estimated future discounted cash flows of the respective community.
⟦s002537⟧ We write down communities with a fair value less than their carrying value to such fair value, and report resulting losses within cost of home closings.
⟦s002538⟧ Home closing gross profit Home closing gross profit is home closing revenue less cost of home closings for the reported period.
⟦s002539⟧ Home closing gross margin is home closing gross profit expressed as a percentage of home closing revenue.

⟦s002543⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Selling, general, and administrative costs Selling, general and administrative costs consist of corporate and division overhead costs such as payroll and benefits, business insurance, information technology, office costs, outside professional services, travel costs, commissions paid to in-house sales personnel and third-party real estate brokers, and direct sales and marketing overhead costs related to our communities.
⟦s002544⟧ Sales and marketing overhead costs include advertising and marketing costs, model furnishings, costs to maintain our model homes and sales offices, and readying a completed model home for sale.
⟦s002545⟧ We recognize these costs in the period they are incurred.
⟦s002546⟧ We expect that our historical selling, general, and administrative costs will increase as we scale our business and incur incremental costs for personnel and professional services fees related to preparation for becoming, and operating as, a public company.
⟦s002547⟧ This includes, but is not limited to, regulatory and compliance costs applicable to listed public companies, and higher expenditures for compensation costs, insurance, technology, and professional services.

⟦s002549⟧ Therefore, no provision has been made for federal, state, or local income taxes.
⟦s002550⟧ Smith Douglas Holdings LLC incurs certain state franchise and gross receipts taxes that it includes in selling, general, and administrative costs in our statements of income.

⟦s002555⟧ Net new home orders for a period are gross new home orders less any cancellations of home order contracts during the same period.
⟦s002556⟧ We recognize a home order when we approve a contract signed by a homebuyer and collect any deposit required thereunder.
⟦s002557⟧ The contract value of net new home orders represents the sum of the contractual purchase prices of the homes included in net new home orders for the period presented.
⟦s002558⟧ Cancellation rate We record a cancellation when a homebuyer under contract desires to cancel their purchase prior to delivery of the home.
⟦s002559⟧ Increasing cancellations are a negative indicator of future performance and can be an indicator of decreased home closing revenue, cost of home closings and net income.
⟦s002560⟧ When a cancellation occurs, we generally retain the homebuyer deposit and resell the home to a new homebuyer.
⟦s002561⟧ Cancellations can occur due to homebuyer credit issues or changes to the homebuyer’s desires.
⟦s002562⟧ The cancellation rate is the total number of cancellations during the specified period divided by the total gross new home orders during the applicable period.
⟦s002563⟧ Backlog homes (period end) Backlog homes (period end) is the number of homes in backlog from the previous period plus the number of net new home orders generated during the current period minus the number of homes closed during the current period.
⟦s002564⟧ Backlog at period end includes homes currently under construction and homes that are sold where construction has not yet commenced.

⟦s002748⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS The decrease in the number of backlog homes and backlog value as of December 31, 2022, as compared to December 31, 2021, is primarily attributable to the downward demand from rising mortgage rates in the back half of 2022 and the increase in home closings in 2022 as previously described.

⟦s002952⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Liquidity and capital resources Overview As of September 30, 2023, we had $10.
⟦s002953⟧ 4 million of cash and cash equivalents.
⟦s002954⟧ We believe existing cash and cash equivalents, availability under our Existing Credit Facility and positive cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.
⟦s002955⟧ We have historically generated cash and fund our operations primarily from cash flows from operating activities as well as availability under our credit facilities and other borrowings.
⟦s002956⟧ We exercise strict controls and have a prudent strategy for our cash management, including those related to cash outlays for lot acquisitions and deposits on lot-option contracts.
⟦s002957⟧ We require multiple party account control and authorization for payments.
⟦s002958⟧ We competitively bid each phase of the development and construction process and closely manage production schedules and payments.
⟦s002959⟧ Land acquisitions are reviewed and analyzed by our senior management team and ultimately approved by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
⟦s002960⟧ Additionally, our land-light business model reduces our upfront capital requirements and generally provides for “just-in-time” lot delivery, which better aligns our pace of home orders and home starts.
⟦s002961⟧ Our principal uses of cash include deposits on lot-option contracts, acquisition of finished lots, home construction, operating expenses, and the payment of interest and routine liabilities.
⟦s002962⟧ In the coming 12 months, our primary funding needs will revolve around the construction of homes, acquisition of finished lots under new and existing contracts, and operating expenses.
⟦s002963⟧ Additionally, we may seek to use our capital to enter new markets through acquisition or greenfield startup if we believe such markets fit our business model.
⟦s002964⟧ To address these short-term liquidity requirements, we anticipate relying on our existing cash and cash equivalents, as well as the net cash flows generated by our operations and availability under our Amended Credit Facility.
⟦s002965⟧ However, the opportunity to purchase substantially finished lots in desired locations is becoming increasingly more competitive.
⟦s002966⟧ As a result, we remain open to seeking additional capital if necessary to enhance our liquidity position, further enable the acquisition of additional finished lot inventory in anticipation of improving market conditions and the competitive landscape, and fortify our long-term capital structure.
⟦s002967⟧ Looking beyond the next 12 months, our primary funding needs will continue to center around home construction, finished lot acquisitions necessary to maintain a minimum four-year lot supply, growing active community count, growth into new and existing markets, and interest payments on our Amended Credit Facility.
⟦s002968⟧ We expect our existing cash reserves, along with generated cash flows and availability under our Amended Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operational activities and provide the necessary capital for future lot purchases and related growth strategies.
⟦s002969⟧ To the extent our current liquidity is insufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional funds, such as refinancing or securing new secured or unsecured debt, common and preferred equity, disposing of certain assets to fund our operations, and/or other public or private sources of capital.
⟦s002970⟧ If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted.
⟦s002971⟧ The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations, and any future instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that could restrict our operations.
⟦s002972⟧ We cannot assure you that we could obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all.
⟦s002973⟧ See “Risk factors—General risk factors—Access to financing sources may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, especially in light of current market conditions, which could adversely affect our ability to maximize our returns.
⟦s002974⟧ ” Existing Credit Facility On October 28, 2021, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into a $175.

⟦s002993⟧ Subsequently, in June 2023, we received another waiver extending the requirement to July 31, 2023.

⟦s003002⟧ Amended Credit Facility Concurrently with, and conditioned upon, the closing of this offering, Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, as borrowers, intend to enter into the Amended Credit Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders, and the Lenders, and, as part of the Refinancing, we intend to use a portion of our net proceeds from this offering for the Debt Repayment, see “Use of proceeds.
⟦s003003⟧ ” The Amended Credit Facility is conditioned upon the closing of this offering and certain other customary conditions to effectiveness, however, this offering is not contingent upon the effectiveness of the Amended Credit Facility.
⟦s003004⟧ Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Amended Credit Facility, Smith Douglas Homes Corp. will not be a party to the Amended Credit Facility.
⟦s003005⟧ The Amended Credit Facility will, among other things, increase the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit commitments to $250.
⟦s003006⟧ 0 million and extend the maturity date to the date that is three years after the closing of the Amended Credit Facility, provided that the borrowers may request a one-year extension of its maturity date.
⟦s003007⟧ The Amended Credit Facility will also include a $100.
⟦s003008⟧ 0 million accordion feature, subject to additional commitments, and will provide that up to $20.
⟦s003009⟧ 0 million may be used for letters of credit.
⟦s003010⟧ The borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility may not exceed the borrowing base as defined in the Amended Credit Facility.
⟦s003011⟧ The borrowing base primarily consists of a percentage of commercial land, land held for development, lots under development and finished lots held by Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and certain of its wholly-owned its subsidiaries.
⟦s003012⟧ Borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility will bear interest, at the borrower’s option, at either a base rate or SOFR (which may be a daily simple rate or based on 1-, 3- or 6-month interest periods, in each case at the borrower’s option), plus an applicable margin.

⟦s003018⟧ The Amended Credit Facility will be unsecured.
⟦s003019⟧ Upon the occurrence of certain triggers set forth in the Amended Credit Facility, Smith Douglas Homes Corp. may be required to provide a guarantee of the obligations of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and the other borrowers under the Amended Credit Facility.
⟦s003020⟧ The Amended Credit Facility will contain certain financial covenants, among others, including requirements to maintain (i) a minimum tangible net worth equal to the sum of (a) $130.

⟦s003029⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS investments and distributions.
⟦s003030⟧ Additionally, the Amended Credit Facility will contain certain covenants that will restrict certain activities of Smith Douglas Homes Corp. The Amended Credit Facility also contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, failure to make payments, breach of covenants and breach of representations.
⟦s003031⟧ If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the borrowers may be required immediately to repay all amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility.
⟦s003032⟧ The foregoing description of the Amended Credit Facility is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Amended Credit Facility, a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit hereto.
⟦s003033⟧ There is no guarantee that we will enter into the Amended Credit Facility on the terms described herein or at all.
⟦s003034⟧ For additional information regarding our Existing Credit Facility, see the notes to the audited financial statements (Note 4, Notes Payable ) contained elsewhere in this prospectus.
⟦s003035⟧ Additional liquidity requirements after completion of offering After the completion of this offering, we will be a holding company and will have no material assets other than our ownership of LLC Interests.
⟦s003036⟧ We will have no independent means of generating revenue.
⟦s003037⟧ The Smith Douglas LLC Agreement that will be in effect at the time of this offering provides for the payment of certain distributions to the Continuing Equity Owners and to us in amounts sufficient to cover the income taxes imposed on such members with respect to the allocation of taxable income from Smith Douglas Holdings LLC as well as to cover our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and other administrative expenses.
⟦s003038⟧ Regarding the ability of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC to make distributions to us, the terms of their financing arrangements (including the Existing Credit Facility and the Amended Credit Facility) contain covenants that may restrict Smith Douglas Holdings LLC or its subsidiaries from paying such distributions, subject to certain exceptions.
⟦s003039⟧ Further, Smith Douglas Holdings LLC is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC (with certain exceptions), as applicable, exceed the fair value of its assets.
⟦s003040⟧ In addition, under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will be required to make cash payments to the Continuing Equity Owners equal to 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize (or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize), as a result of (i) Basis Adjustments; (ii) Section 704(c) Allocations; and (iii) certain tax benefits (such as interest deductions) arising from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s003041⟧ We expect the amount of the cash payments that we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be significant.
⟦s003042⟧ The actual amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions or exchanges by the Continuing Equity Owners, the amount of gain recognized by the Continuing Equity Owners, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future, and the federal tax rates then applicable.
⟦s003043⟧ Any payments made by us to the Continuing Equity Owners under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us.
⟦s003044⟧ Additionally, in the event we declare any cash dividends, we intend to cause Smith Douglas Holdings LLC to make distributions to us in amounts sufficient to fund such cash dividends declared by us to our stockholders.
⟦s003045⟧ Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings, or cash flow of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions.
⟦s003046⟧ If we do not have sufficient funds to pay taxes or other liabilities or to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders.
⟦s003047⟧ To the extent we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s003048⟧ In addition, if Smith Douglas Holdings LLC does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends will also be restricted or impaired.

⟦s003098⟧ See “—Liquidity and capital resources—Existing Credit Facility.
⟦s003099⟧ ” Off-balance sheet arrangements While using land bankers and third-party developers as part of our land-light operating strategy comes at an additional cost, we believe our lot acquisition strategy reduces our operating and financial risk relative to other homebuilders that own and develop a higher percentage of their land supply.
⟦s003100⟧ As of September 30, 2023, we had 395 owned unstarted lots in real estate inventory on our balance sheet which represented only 3.
⟦s003101⟧ 4% of our total controlled lot supply.
⟦s003102⟧ Under the umbrella of our land-light strategy, we generally seek to avoid engaging in land development.
⟦s003103⟧ Where possible, we prefer to work with third-party developers that will sell us finished lots under lot-option contracts.
⟦s003104⟧ In situations where we cannot find a developer partner, we will work with third-party land bankers.
⟦s003105⟧ Under these land bank arrangements, we typically assign the land or lots we have under contract to the land banker.
⟦s003106⟧ The land banker will acquire the land or lots directly, and if land development is necessary, we will simultaneously enter into a development agreement to complete the lots for the land banker.
⟦s003107⟧ Additionally, we will enter a lot-option contract to acquire the finished lots on a takedown to match our projected sales absorption and starts pace.
⟦s003108⟧ Typically, we are required to put up a deposit ranging between 5-20% on our lot-option contracts.
⟦s003109⟧ Our asset-light and capital efficient lot acquisition strategy is intended to avoid the financial commitments and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development by allowing us to control a significant number of lots for a relatively low capital cost.
⟦s003110⟧ These option contracts generally allow us, at our option, to forfeit our right to purchase the lots controlled by these option contracts for any reason, and our sole legal obligation and economic loss as a result of such forfeitures is limited to the amount of the deposits paid pursuant to such option contracts and, in the case of land bank option contracts, any related fees paid to the land bank partner.
⟦s003111⟧ We do not have any financial guarantees and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these agreements.
⟦s003112⟧ In certain circumstances, we may have a completion obligation under development agreements with land bankers where we may be at-risk for certain cost overruns.
⟦s003113⟧ As of September 30, 2023, we had $43.
⟦s003114⟧ 6 million of non-refundable cash deposits under land and lot-option contracts, including option contracts with unconsolidated entities, pertaining to 7,418 lots with a remaining aggregate purchase price of approximately $463.
⟦s003115⟧ 4 million.
⟦s003116⟧ Surety bonds and letters of credit From time to time, we may enter into surety bond and letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities, government agencies and developers.
⟦s003117⟧ These arrangements relate to certain performance or maintenance-related obligations.
⟦s003118⟧ As of September 30, 2023, there were no outstanding letters of credit.
⟦s003119⟧ Surety bonds do not have stated expiration dates, rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed.

⟦s003125⟧ 4 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, are typically outstanding over a period of approximately one to five years depending on the pace of development.
⟦s003126⟧ If banks were to decline to issue letters of credit or surety companies were to decline to issue surety bonds, our ability to operate could be restricted and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
⟦s003127⟧ Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk Market risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates.

⟦s003129⟧ As overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates, a significant increase in interest rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing.

⟦s003135⟧ We do not enter into, nor do we intend to enter into in the future, derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes to hedge against interest rate fluctuations.
⟦s003136⟧ Inflation and commodity risk We and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of higher land, financing, labor, and material construction costs.
⟦s003137⟧ In addition, higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers.
⟦s003138⟧ We attempt to pass through to our homebuyers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices.
⟦s003139⟧ However, during periods of soft housing market conditions, we may not be able to offset our cost increases with higher selling prices.
⟦s003140⟧ Critical accounting policies and estimates In preparing our financial statements in conformity with U.
⟦s003141⟧ S.
⟦s003142⟧ GAAP, we must make decisions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures.
⟦s003143⟧ Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates.
⟦s003144⟧ In reaching such decisions, we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances, historical experience, and business valuations.
⟦s003145⟧ Actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared.
⟦s003146⟧ Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, Description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies , to our accompanying financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this registration statement.
⟦s003147⟧ Some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments or estimates.
⟦s003148⟧ An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria: (i) the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (ii) different estimates reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations.
⟦s003149⟧ Our critical accounting estimates include the following: Revenue recognition We recognize revenue when a home closes with a homebuyer and title and possession of the property are transferred to that homebuyer.
⟦s003150⟧ Our performance obligation, to deliver the home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date.
⟦s003151⟧ When we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, the cash deposits received are recorded as contract liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled.
⟦s003152⟧ We either retain or refund to the 110

⟦s003155⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.
⟦s003156⟧ As of September 30, 2023, homebuyer deposits totaled $9.
⟦s003157⟧ 5 million.
⟦s003158⟧ As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, homebuyer deposits totaled $9.
⟦s003159⟧ 4 million and $9.
⟦s003160⟧ 9 million, respectively.
⟦s003161⟧ Substantially all homebuyer deposits are recognized in revenue within one year of being received from homebuyers.
⟦s003162⟧ Real estate inventory Real estate inventory consists primarily of the capitalized costs of finished homes, homes under construction, and residential lots.
⟦s003163⟧ We include the costs of lot acquisitions, development, direct home construction, capitalized interest, closing costs, and direct and certain indirect overhead costs incurred during home construction in inventories.
⟦s003164⟧ Real estate inventory is stated at cost unless the community is determined to be impaired, at which point the inventory is written down to fair value as required by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment.
⟦s003165⟧ We review our real estate inventory for indicators of potential impairment on a quarterly basis at the community level considering market and economic conditions, current sales absorption rates, and recent profitability of new home orders.
⟦s003166⟧ When an indicator of impairment is identified, we prepare and analyze cash flows at the community level on an undiscounted basis.
⟦s003167⟧ If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the community’s carrying value, we generally estimate the fair value using the estimated future discounted cash flows of respective inventories.
⟦s003168⟧ A community with a fair value less than its carrying value is written down to such fair value and resulting losses are reported within home closing gross profit.
⟦s003169⟧ No impairments were recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
⟦s003170⟧ Business combinations From time to time, we may enter into business combinations.
⟦s003171⟧ In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations , we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of acquisition.
⟦s003172⟧ We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
⟦s003173⟧ Goodwill is assigned to each reporting unit based upon the relative fair value of tangible assets acquired.
⟦s003174⟧ The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of real estate inventory and contingent consideration.
⟦s003175⟧ Significant estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value of the acquired real estate inventory include subjective and/or complex judgments regarding items such as estimates of future net proceeds, discount rate, and costs to complete.
⟦s003176⟧ Significant estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value of contingent consideration include subjective and/or complex judgments regarding items such as the gross margin discount rate, gross margin volatility, drift rate, and cost of debt.
⟦s003177⟧ The acquisition method of accounting also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date.
⟦s003178⟧ If we are required to adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
⟦s003179⟧ If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record future impairment charges.
⟦s003180⟧ We describe our accounting policy for business combinations in Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
⟦s003181⟧ In Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe the business combination completed during the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 and the estimates, assumptions used, and areas for which the acquisition accounting is not yet finalized.
⟦s003182⟧ Recent accounting pronouncements There are no recent accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us that have not been adopted in our financial statements presented elsewhere is this prospectus.

⟦s003189⟧ This decision to opt out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act is irrevocable.
⟦s003190⟧ We are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act.
⟦s003191⟧ Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if as an emerging growth company we choose to rely on such exemptions, we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our systems of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Act, (iii) comply with the requirement of the PCAOB regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor’s report on the financial statements, and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation-related items, such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.
⟦s003192⟧ These exemptions will apply until we no longer meet the requirements of being an emerging growth company.
⟦s003193⟧ We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.

⟦s003231⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS affordability, housing demand has improved, helped by relative strength in the overall economy.
⟦s003232⟧ Many economic gauges are stable and improving, namely employment and inflation, which gives prospective homebuyers more confidence.
⟦s003233⟧ Risks remain in the economy, and the risk of recession remains elevated given the magnitude of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.
⟦s003234⟧ The success of all housing projects depends partially on factors beyond the control of the builder, such as the economy, interest rates, and government policies.
⟦s003235⟧ On a national basis, we forecast that single-family home permits issued will decrease approximately 7% in 2023 and rise 2% in 2024 as housing demand stabilizes despite mortgage rates that are more than twice their 2020 and 2021 levels.
⟦s003236⟧ Land buying is beginning to pick up once again as builders become more confident about housing demand.
⟦s003237⟧ We estimate a decline of 1.
⟦s003238⟧ 9% in new home price appreciation in 2023 as builders continue to offer incentives, though to a lesser degree than in 2022.
⟦s003239⟧ Existing home supply remains at very low levels, which means home builders are providing a greater share of total housing supply than in recent history.
⟦s003240⟧ Our primary assumptions and conclusions are: • mortgage rates above 5.
⟦s003241⟧ 0% will continue through at least 2025; • housing affordability will improve as incomes rise, home prices fall, and mortgage rates decline from today’s elevated levels; and • the low unemployment rate will gradually recede, with flat job growth expected in 2025.
⟦s003242⟧ Housing demand Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, annual job growth had remained positive since 2010, and household formation was accelerating.
⟦s003243⟧ Job losses from the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession ceased in 2010.

⟦s003260⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Over the long-term, JBREC forecasts that an estimated 1.
⟦s003261⟧ 27 million net new households should be formed per year on average between 2020 and 2030, due largely to shifting demographics in the U.
⟦s003262⟧ S.
⟦s003263⟧ This pace is similar to that experienced in other post-recessionary periods.
⟦s003264⟧ A substantial portion of this net growth in households is expected to be owner households, which should strengthen demand for new for-sale housing.
⟦s003265⟧ Demographic trends also will contribute to this future household growth.
⟦s003266⟧ According to JBREC projections, demographic shifts will increase the 35-44-year-old cohort (a driver of household formation) by approximately 3.
⟦s003267⟧ 7 million people from 2020-2030, with this estimate influenced by immigration trends.
⟦s003268⟧ Additionally, entry-level household formation continues to benefit from the combination of the large number of people who were born during the 1990s and are coming of adult age, and the continued unfurling of pent-up household formation from slightly older young adults born in the 1980s.
⟦s003269⟧ While most of these newly formed households tend to rent first, most say they aspire to homeownership, which should continue to fuel the demand for entry-level owned homes The largest five-year age group in the country turns 31 to 35 years old in 2023, which is aligned with the typical ages of first-time homebuyers.

⟦s003280⟧ The average year-over-year income change is 2.
⟦s003281⟧ 9% over the past 30 years.

⟦s003283⟧ 5% year-over-year to $57,700 as of July 2023, based on 2013 chained dollars.
⟦s003284⟧ High inflation is causing real incomes to decline for middle-class households.
⟦s003285⟧ New home supply After elevated permit activity in 2021 and 2022, the new home construction industry has seen permit levels slow as the cost of capital has risen, and demand has slowed due to weakened affordability.
⟦s003286⟧ The number of single-family home permits issued rose to as high as 1,136,200 for the 12 months ended August 31, 2021, which is approximately 23% above the 1980-2019 average of approximately 924,000.
⟦s003287⟧ More recently, single-family home permits issued fell to 924,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis through July 2023.
⟦s003288⟧ JBREC is forecasting decreased new home permits and slower new residential construction activity in 2023, with a 7% decrease in single-family and 20% decrease in multifamily permit activity relative to 2022.

⟦s003327⟧ Existing home sale supply has risen to 3.
⟦s003328⟧ 3 months as of July 2023, which remains low by historical standards and has kept home prices from falling further in a rising-mortgage-rate environment.
⟦s003329⟧ Affordability As of July 2023, national affordability in the existing home market remains weaker than the historical normal level.
⟦s003330⟧ The ratio of annual housing costs for owning the median priced resale home compared to 125% of the median household income (a reasonable estimate of homeowners’ incomes) reached a 30+ year high in late 2022, due to rising mortgage interest rates coupled with elevated levels of home price appreciation.

⟦s004033⟧ There are approximately 19,900 permit offices called “places” throughout the country where builders go to get their permits.
⟦s004034⟧ These places can be incorporated cities, Census Designated Places (the “CDPs”) or unincorporated areas of a county.
⟦s004035⟧ Some of these places do not report to the Census Bureau throughout the year and report only at year end.
⟦s004036⟧ We have factored this understatement into our permit calculations.
⟦s004037⟧ We use the formula below to calculate permits for the last 12 months: The Census Bureau releases two datasets for permits every month.
⟦s004038⟧ One set contains monthly figures and the other are cumulative year-to-date figures for each of the “places” within the United States.
⟦s004039⟧ The monthly figures are never restated, but the cumulative year-to-date figures include any revisions made in the previous months.
⟦s004040⟧ We use the cumulative year-to-date figure for each place since it is more accurate than the sum of the monthly figures.
⟦s004041⟧ Both datasets are typically released four weeks after the end of each month.
⟦s004042⟧ The Census Bureau also releases annual figures incorporating all revisions.

⟦s004073⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Business Our company We are one of the nation’s fastest growing private homebuilders by number of closings and are engaged in the design, construction, and sale of single-family homes in some of the highest growth and most desirable markets in the Southeastern and Southern United States.
⟦s004074⟧ We employ an efficient land-light, production focused, and conservatively leveraged business model, which we believe results in a compelling combination of strong home closing gross margins, construction cycle times, and returns.
⟦s004075⟧ Our communities are primarily targeted to entry-level and empty-nest homebuyers.
⟦s004076⟧ We offer our homebuyers an attractive value proposition by providing a personalized home buying experience at affordable price points.
⟦s004077⟧ With the goal of becoming one of the most dominant homebuilders in the Southeastern and Southern United States, we intend to grow operations within our existing footprint and to expand into new markets where we can most effectively implement our business strategy and maximize our profit and returns.
⟦s004078⟧ Pursuant to our land-light business model, we typically purchase finished lots through lot-option contracts from third-party land developers or land bankers.
⟦s004079⟧ Our lot acquisition strategy reduces our up-front capital requirements and generally provides for “just-in-time” lot delivery, which closely aligns with our pace of home orders and home starts.
⟦s004080⟧ We believe our lot acquisition strategy reduces our operating and financial risk relative to other homebuilders that own a higher percentage of their land supply on balance sheet.
⟦s004081⟧ As of both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 96% of our unstarted controlled lots were controlled through finished lot option contracts.
⟦s004082⟧ Our strategy and focus on capital efficiency has delivered strong risk-adjusted returns, as evidenced by our adjusted return on equity and adjusted return on inventory of 63% and 57%, respectively, for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, excluding our Houston segment acquired pursuant to the Devon Street Homes Acquisition, and of 81% and 75%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022.
⟦s004083⟧ We are a disciplined, process driven, and schedule-oriented company.
⟦s004084⟧ We utilize a single database ERP system called SMART Builder (that we nonexclusively license from an entity affiliated with the Founder Fund) that is fully integrated with our homebuilding operations.
⟦s004085⟧ Through SMART Builder, we manage all aspects of our construction process and work-flow scheduling in real-time, enhancing our operating efficiency and helping us generate higher returns for our stockholders.
⟦s004086⟧ Additionally, we approach our homebuilding operations through a partnership-oriented and relationship-based process called Rteam.
⟦s004087⟧ The key tenet of Rteam is to enhance the collaboration, visibility, and mutual accountability between us and our key business partners, including the developers, suppliers, and trade partners within our production model.
⟦s004088⟧ The Rteam process is the foundation of our operational success and the key driver of our current strong construction cycle times of approximately 64 business days and high inventory turnover rate of 3.
⟦s004089⟧ 8x for the year ended December 31, 2022.
⟦s004090⟧ The combination of our production efficiency and real-time construction management capabilities allows us to generate strong home closing gross margins, which were 29% for both the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022.
⟦s004091⟧ We pride ourselves on offering our homebuyers a personalized, affordable luxury buying experience at attractive prices.
⟦s004092⟧ For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our ASP of homes closed was approximately $333,000, providing an attractive price point for our target homebuyers with starting base prices below FHA loan limits.
⟦s004093⟧ We construct most of our homes on a pre-sold basis, where our homebuyers choose their homes based on a select number of value-engineered floor plans and are offered flexibility on the selection of home options.
⟦s004094⟧ The SMART Builder system and Rteam process allows this optionality for homebuyers based on just-in-time modifications.
⟦s004095⟧ As a result of our differentiated value proposition and efficient construction cycle times, we believe we typically achieve a high level of homebuyer satisfaction and experience low cancellation rates, which were 9% and 11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively.
⟦s004096⟧ Our geographic footprint is concentrated in markets that demonstrate strong population and employment growth trends, favorable migration patterns, and desirable lifestyle and weather conditions.
⟦s004097⟧ Our operations are currently organized into six geographical segments; our reportable segments include Atlanta (which includes certain Atlanta suburbs like Dalton, GA), Raleigh, Charlotte, Nashville, Alabama (which consists of both Birmingham and Huntsville), and Houston.
⟦s004098⟧ Each of our markets is experiencing strong momentum in housing demand drivers relative to historic averages, and we believe there is significant opportunity to expand our presence in each of our respective markets.
⟦s004099⟧ We intend to utilize proceeds from this offering to continue the expansion of our communities and the overall growth of our platform.
⟦s004100⟧ We have demonstrated significant growth since our inception in 2008, joining the Builder 140

⟦s004103⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Magazine Top 100 list as the 83rd largest builder based on number of closings in 2014 and have grown to be ranked as the 38th largest builder for closings in 2022.
⟦s004104⟧ Additionally, based off of the Builder Magazine Top 100 list, we believe we are the second largest private builder founded after 2007 and sixth largest builder overall founded after 2007, each based on 2022 home closings.
⟦s004105⟧ During the year ended December 31, 2022, we closed 2,200 homes as compared to 526 homes in the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 23% CAGR over the last seven years.
⟦s004106⟧ In the same period, our revenue grew at a 32% CAGR from $109.
⟦s004107⟧ 3 million to $755.
⟦s004108⟧ 4 million.
⟦s004109⟧ Our history Our founder and Executive Chairman, Tom Bradbury, has almost 50 years of experience in the homebuilding industry.
⟦s004110⟧ Before founding Smith Douglas Homes, Mr. Bradbury founded Colony Homes in 1975, and built it into one of the largest and most recognized homebuilders in the Southeastern United States in the 1990s and early 2000s.
⟦s004111⟧ Our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Vice Chairman, Greg Bennett, worked alongside Mr. Bradbury at Colony Homes as Region President, where he helped drive the growth of the company.
⟦s004112⟧ While running Colony Homes, Mr. Bradbury and Mr. Bennett developed and refined the disciplined operating philosophy and integrated ERP system (SMART Builder) that we nonexclusively license for use today.
⟦s004113⟧ Like Smith Douglas Homes, Colony Homes catered to the entry-level homebuyer segment, and it had peak closings of over 2,200 homes in 2001 before its eventual sale to KB Home in 2003.
⟦s004114⟧ In 2008, in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, Mr. Bradbury saw a unique opportunity to re-enter the homebuilding industry, creating Smith Douglas Homes and breaking ground on its first home in Atlanta, Georgia.
⟦s004115⟧ In 2014, we surpassed 500 cumulative closings in Atlanta and began to establish our regional presence with an organic expansion into the Raleigh market followed by Birmingham in 2016, and Charlotte and Nashville in 2017.
⟦s004116⟧ In 2017, across all our existing markets, we delivered over 1,000 homes and generated approximately $240.
⟦s004117⟧ 3 million of home closing revenue.
⟦s004118⟧ In 2020, we continued to scale within our markets, completing over 900 annual home closings in Atlanta while also closing on over 200 homes in each of our other markets.
⟦s004119⟧ In addition, in that year we continued our organic expansion by entering the Huntsville market.
⟦s004120⟧ In 2023, we were ranked the second largest private builder by 2022 closings by the Atlanta Real Estate Forum, and in 2022 Atlanta became our first market to account for over 1,000 home closings in a calendar year.
⟦s004121⟧ During the year ended December 31, 2022, we closed 2,200 homes across all our markets while surpassing 10,000 cumulative home closings.
⟦s004122⟧ As part of the next phase of our growth, we intend to expand operations within the Southern United States.
⟦s004123⟧ On July 31, 2023, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Devon Street Homes, a high-quality regional homebuilder based in Houston, Texas that closed 324 homes in 2022.
⟦s004124⟧ We believe the acquisition of Devon Street Homes will create a launching point for our company within the Texas market and will allow us to pursue expansion opportunities across the Southern United States.

⟦s004136⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Our competitive strengths We strive to generate consistent growth and strong risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through our attractive operational and financial profile supported by our combination of operating efficiencies, a land-light business model, and a conservative balance sheet.
⟦s004137⟧ Our track record of successful financial performance and growth is driven by our relentless focus on optimizing our homebuilding operations and the efficient use of our capital.
⟦s004138⟧ We believe the following strengths create a significant competitive advantage as we execute upon our business strategy and pursue future growth.
⟦s004139⟧ Efficient, schedule driven manufacturing platform that drives strong construction cycle times and robust home closing gross margins We maintain a highly efficient homebuilding production model which results in robust home closing gross margins and profitability.
⟦s004140⟧ We achieve economies of scale across our production model by offering a consistent set of core floor plan options across all our markets, which in turn creates a streamlined process for our construction partners.
⟦s004141⟧ For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, for example, over 93% of our closings were derived from fewer than 30 floor plans.
⟦s004142⟧ Based on prior management experience, we believe this number of floor plans is much smaller than other comparably sized public company homebuilders.
⟦s004143⟧ We seek to further improve our production efficiencies through the continuity of the trade partner construction teams we utilize across multiple job sites.
⟦s004144⟧ This approach increases trade partner familiarity with our floor plans and building materials, which in turn increases their productivity and allows us to target a minimum of one home start a day per Rteam.
⟦s004145⟧ As a result of our differentiated operating model, we have achieved an average construction cycle time of approximately 64 business days, which is among the lowest average construction cycle times in the public homebuilding sector, and a high adjusted return on inventory, which was 57% and 75% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, excluding our Houston segment acquired pursuant to the Devon Street Homes Acquisition, and for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively.
⟦s004146⟧ We believe our Rteam philosophy is the foundation of our operational success.
⟦s004147⟧ As part of our operating philosophy, we maintain a high level of transparency, communication, and partnership between our employees and our business partners, including our developers, our suppliers, and our trade partners.
⟦s004148⟧ We place significant focus on accountability and collaboration, emphasizing a mindset of shared success whereby each partner’s contribution is critical to the success of everyone else and the overall success of a project.
⟦s004149⟧ Lastly, we focus on maintaining long-term partnerships with our suppliers, collaborating with them across multiple communities and markets whenever possible.
⟦s004150⟧ This approach provides our suppliers with more scale and allows us to procure building materials more efficiently at favorable prices.

⟦s004154⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS To facilitate our efficient homebuilding operations, we utilize an ERP system, SMART Builder, which is a real-time, schedule driven, single database that manages our entire homebuilding construction ecosystem, including sales, purchasing, scheduling, production, accounting, and servicing.
⟦s004155⟧ To increase planning and organization efficiency, our trade partners can also access SMART Builder to have visibility into the status of various workstreams.
⟦s004156⟧ Utilizing SMART Builder helps us drive a consistent and repeatable process, eliminate unnecessary site visits, and create a steadier workflow by avoiding variance orders and peak staffing from our trade partners, all contributing to lower overall costs.
⟦s004157⟧ SMART Builder also integrates daily expense information on a unit level basis, helping us accurately monitor project costs in real-time and ensure our projects stay within budget.
⟦s004158⟧ Our ability to streamline production and reduce operating costs has resulted in high home closing gross margins, which were 29% for both the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2022, among the highest in the public homebuilding sector.
⟦s004159⟧ Land-light business model that allows for both risk mitigation and enhanced returns Core to our success is the capital efficient, land-light operating strategy we have employed since our inception.
⟦s004160⟧ We believe this approach mitigates risk and, consistent with our efficiency focused culture, enhances our returns.
⟦s004161⟧ We primarily acquire finished lots from reputable third-party land developers and land bankers through lot-option contracts, thereby avoiding the financial requirements and risks associated with land ownership and land development.
⟦s004162⟧ Our primary obligation and potential economic risk for failure to perform under our lot-option contracts is typically limited to the amount of our deposit.
⟦s004163⟧ Additionally, we aim to limit our balance sheet risk by typically keeping less than two months of finished lots on our balance sheet at any given time.
⟦s004164⟧ By utilizing a “just-in-time” approach to lot acquisitions, we reduce our up-front capital commitments and in turn drive higher inventory turnover and returns.
⟦s004165⟧ As of September 30, 2023, we controlled 10,279 lots through option contracts, representing 96% of our total unstarted controlled lots, compared to an average of 49% for public company homebuilders.
⟦s004166⟧ Our inventory turnover was 3.
⟦s004167⟧ 0x for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, excluding our Houston segment acquired pursuant to the Devon Street Homes Acquisition, and 3.
⟦s004168⟧ 8x for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to an average inventory turnover of 1.
⟦s004169⟧ 2x and 1.
⟦s004170⟧ 3x, respectively, for the same periods, for public company homebuilders.
⟦s004171⟧ Our adjusted return on equity and adjusted return on inventory was 63% and 57%, respectively, for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, excluding our Houston segment acquired pursuant to the Devon Street Homes Acquisition, and 81% and 75%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the averages of 21% and 18%, respectively, for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, and 28% and 24%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022, for public company homebuilders.
⟦s004172⟧ Established presence in attractive, high growth markets We are focused on favorable, high growth housing markets primarily in the Southeastern and Southern United States.
⟦s004173⟧ Since establishing our initial presence in Atlanta, we have steadily expanded our footprint into Raleigh, Birmingham, Charlotte, Nashville, Huntsville, and Houston over the last nine years.

⟦s004177⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Our markets exhibit attractive demographic trends, including high employment growth, strong supply and demand fundamentals, positive net migration, home price appreciation, favorable land pricing, and low costs of living, which we believe will support the long-term growth of new home orders.
⟦s004178⟧ According to JBREC, the majority of our markets rank among the top ten in the Southeast for positive net migration over the last year.
⟦s004179⟧ We believe the combination of these compelling trends and our strong presence within these markets will help facilitate the execution of our growth strategy.
⟦s004180⟧ Scalable platform well positioned to expand in existing and new markets Since our inception in 2008, we have expanded our homebuilding operations through consistent organic growth.
⟦s004181⟧ We utilize our management team’s deep industry knowledge, disciplined underwriting and project management capabilities, and our scalable, process-driven, schedule-oriented platform to grow in submarkets within our existing footprint as well as enter new markets.
⟦s004182⟧ In Atlanta, we have rapidly and profitably grown our presence, celebrating our 5,000th cumulative closing in 2020.
⟦s004183⟧ We have successfully scaled our business while maintaining strong margins by targeting markets where we can replicate our land-light strategy and Rteam production model, and also leverage our strong relationships with local developers, suppliers, and municipalities to grow communities.
⟦s004184⟧ For the year ended December 31, 2022, we closed 2,200 homes, achieving a 23% CAGR on closed homes from 2015 to 2022.
⟦s004185⟧ Among homebuilders that began operations after 2007, based off of the Builder Magazine Top 100 list, we believe we are the sixth largest homebuilder in the country and the second largest private builder, each based on number of 2022 home closings, which further highlights our platform’s ability to scale.
⟦s004186⟧ Going forward, we intend to apply our management team’s strong execution capabilities to capitalize on growth opportunities within our existing markets and new markets.

⟦s004190⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Differentiated ability to offer a personalized homebuying experience to price-conscious homebuyers Through our efficient and differentiated operating approach, we have the ability to offer our target homebuyers a personalized affordable luxury buying experience.
⟦s004191⟧ As part of our home offerings, we provide homebuyers a wide range of value engineered exterior and interior options.
⟦s004192⟧ Additionally, because we offer a consistent, optimized set of floor plans and home options across our markets, we can reduce costs, shorten construction cycle times, and ultimately deliver a high-quality personalized home at an attractive price point, which averaged approximately $333,000 on homes closed during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
⟦s004193⟧ Combined, our compelling value, high level of personalization, and superior home construction times have resulted in one of the lowest cancellation rates amongst all the public company homebuilders, which were 9% and 11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, meaningfully below public company homebuilders’ average of 15% and 21%, respectively, for the same periods.
⟦s004194⟧ We believe our ability to offer a personalized buying experience at an affordable price point will continue to create meaningful differentiation in the market for us.
⟦s004195⟧ Veteran management team with track record of success and significant public company experience We benefit from a seasoned management team with a long history of generating consistent positive financial results and strong returns for stockholders.
⟦s004196⟧ Our management team averages over 25 years of industry experience, with many of our executives and upper management having previously held senior roles at other public homebuilder companies, including KB Home, WCI Communities, Beazer Homes, Meritage Homes, Pulte, and NVR.
⟦s004197⟧ Our founder and Executive Chairman, Tom Bradbury, is a long-time industry veteran who previously founded Colony Homes.
⟦s004198⟧ Under his leadership, Colony Homes grew into one of the largest homebuilders in the Southeastern United States focused on entry-level homebuyers and was ultimately sold to KB Home in 2003.
⟦s004199⟧ Our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Vice Chairman, Greg Bennett, has spent most of his career working alongside Mr. Bradbury, starting in 1986 and through his last position as Region President of Colony Homes prior to its sale to KB Home.
⟦s004200⟧ In 2004, Greg founded his own homebuilding company, Greg Bennett Homes, which he operated until he joined Smith Douglas Homes in 2015.
⟦s004201⟧ Our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Russell Devendorf, has previously served as Chief Financial Officer at WCI Communities, where he helped spearhead the restructuring and turnaround of the company from 2008 to its successful initial public offering in 2013 and its eventual sale to Lennar in 2017.
⟦s004202⟧ Our management’s experience adds a level of expertise, governance, and accountability that we believe is distinct for companies of our size.
⟦s004203⟧ After the consummation of this offering, in the aggregate, management will continue to own 85.
⟦s004204⟧ 0% of outstanding common stock, assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, creating long-term alignment of interests between management and stockholders.
⟦s004205⟧ Conservative balance sheet and liquidity, with substantial capacity to drive growth We maintain a conservatively leveraged and flexible balance sheet which reflects our efficiency-minded operating philosophy.
⟦s004206⟧ As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, our debt-to-book capitalization was 29% and 8%, and our net-debt-to-net book capitalization was 26% and (10)%.
⟦s004207⟧ We maintain significant liquidity, with $10.
⟦s004208⟧ 4 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and $85.
⟦s004209⟧ 0 million of undrawn capacity under the Existing Credit Facility (exclusive of outstanding letters of credit) as of September 30, 2023.
⟦s004210⟧ Following this transaction, we believe our enhanced liquidity position will allow us to react nimbly to market conditions and to pursue attractive organic growth or acquisition opportunities.
⟦s004211⟧ Our strategy We expect to execute on the strategies below to establish our legacy as one of the country’s leading homebuilders and to continue driving consistent growth, operating efficiency, and strong returns while delivering high-quality, personalized homes to homebuyers at affordable price points.
⟦s004212⟧ Through the execution of our business strategy, we will strive to expand our platform and become a top homebuilder in the United States.
⟦s004213⟧ Capitalize on our land-light capital strategy to efficiently build new communities and drive superior risk-adjusted returns We intend to continue our land-light lot acquisition strategy to support future growth while maintaining strong equity returns.
⟦s004214⟧ We believe this approach, combined with our primarily pre-selling / build-to-order strategy, allows us to efficiently build new communities while also limiting our operational and financial risk during various 145

⟦s004217⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS economic cycles.
⟦s004218⟧ Without the financial and operational risks of undeveloped land ownership, we create an even flow of lot purchases, better aligning the pace of home orders and home starts.
⟦s004219⟧ Furthermore, to drive greater inventory turnover, we utilize financial incentive structures within our market divisions to target no more than approximately two months of finished lots and four months of started lots at any given time.
⟦s004220⟧ We have utilized the land-light business model since our inception in 2008 and have forged strong relationships with land developers and land bankers that span multiple markets, which we believe give us an advantage when sourcing and executing lot option contracts.
⟦s004221⟧ Supported by these enduring relationships, we believe our land-light strategy differentiates us from peers and allows us to consistently achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns.
⟦s004222⟧ Increase presence and market share within our existing markets Our focused strategy of targeting entry-level and empty-nest homebuyers in our preferred markets has been at the core of our historical expansion and these homebuyer groups will continue to be our primary target demographic.
⟦s004223⟧ We leverage our strong relationships with local developers, suppliers, municipalities, and land bankers to give us deeper access in our existing markets to increase land positions and community count.
⟦s004224⟧ We have experienced rapid organic growth since our inception in 2008, expanding our geographic presence from our headquarters in Atlanta, a market where we are currently one of the largest homebuilders, to six additional key markets with robust growth outlooks: Raleigh, Charlotte, Birmingham, Houston, Huntsville, and Nashville.
⟦s004225⟧ We believe there remains significant opportunity to increase market share and meaningfully grow within our existing markets, driving economies of scale and overall platform growth.
⟦s004226⟧ Opportunistically expand to new markets We see attractive growth opportunities, particularly in the Southeastern and Southern United States, and intend to opportunistically expand into new geographies through organic growth and platform acquisitions.
⟦s004227⟧ We evaluate potential market expansion opportunities using a set of robust strategic market criteria, including availability of land and unmet demand in suburban-plus areas, as well as the ability to pursue a similar lot option strategy, house plans, and construction process while leveraging our Rteam philosophy.
⟦s004228⟧ As part of our new market expansion strategy, we target establishing critical scale of at least 200 annual starts within the first two years of entering a new market in order to maximize our Rteam efficiency.
⟦s004229⟧ Furthermore, we will selectively evaluate external growth opportunities where we can accretively gain scale in a market and enhance our position for future growth.
⟦s004230⟧ For example, our acquisition of Devon Street Homes has helped us enter the highly attractive Houston market, providing us immediate scale and positioning us to grow organically in neighboring Texas markets over time.
⟦s004231⟧ Looking ahead, we will continue to pursue attractive market expansion opportunities that align with our strategy.
⟦s004232⟧ Continue to target our key entry-level and empty-nest homebuyer demographics Our strategy is to target the entry-level and empty-nest demographics in the Southeastern and Southern regions of the U.
⟦s004233⟧ S.
⟦s004234⟧ We believe the fundamental drivers at both the national level and, more specifically, in our local markets have created an increased demand for entry-level priced homes, which we believe makes us well positioned to fulfill this demand as a result of our ASP of homes closed, which was approximately $333,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and one of the lowest among public company homebuilders.
⟦s004235⟧ According to a 2023 NAHB housing affordability analysis, 73% of households cannot afford a median-priced single-family home (which was equal to $418,000 in 2022).
⟦s004236⟧ By targeting lower price point offerings, we are able to drive demand despite broader affordability concerns.
⟦s004237⟧ We operate in attractive market segments, where there is consistent demand for homes as homebuyers look for alternatives to renting, especially with rising rental rates.
⟦s004238⟧ We believe homebuyers appreciate our value proposition created by the combination of our home affordability and the level of personalization we provide.
⟦s004239⟧ Furthermore, in the current environment, the recent rise in interest rates has created a significant affordability problem, making our price points even more attractive.
⟦s004240⟧ In addition, we have significant experience working across multiple mortgage types including, but not limited to, FHA, USDA, and conventional mortgages, which allows us to offer financing support tailored to the needs of our homebuyers.
⟦s004241⟧ Focus on delivering a personalized build-to-order experience at attractive price points We believe a key differentiator of our business is how we redefine affordable luxury for the homebuilding sector.
⟦s004242⟧ Our home offerings address the strong market demand for an affordable luxury experience that provides homebuyer personalization, through an a-la-carte approach to various home design options, without sacrificing affordability.
⟦s004243⟧ Our unique affordable luxury business model is designed to balance an optimized and value-driven 146

⟦s004246⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS homebuyer experience with operational efficiency.
⟦s004247⟧ We have invested significant resources in perfecting approximately 30 value-engineered floor plans that our homebuyers have used in over 93% of total homes closed across all our markets for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
⟦s004248⟧ The streamlined floor plans and strong scheduling adherence allow us to offer high-quality homes at affordable prices with short turnaround times.
⟦s004249⟧ Going forward, we will continue to provide a select variety of home layout options and amenities for our homebuyers in a streamlined and cost-effective manner.
⟦s004250⟧ Lastly, we also consider our homebuyers’ living experience after buying a home in one of our communities, so we have structured our lot and land acquisition strategy to maximize streetscapes and create an efficient community layout.
⟦s004251⟧ We believe this compelling value proposition provides meaningful differentiation in the market, increasing the demand for our homes relative to our competitors, who do not offer the same level of personalization and value at comparable price points.
⟦s004252⟧ With our approach to offering affordable luxury in the homebuilding space, we intend to continue to expand our brand to reach more homebuyers with our unique value proposition.
⟦s004253⟧ Continue to utilize strong cash flow generation to grow platform and drive high return on equity We operate a highly efficient business model that has consistently generated strong margins and significant cash flow.
⟦s004254⟧ Our margin and cash flow profile has historically enabled us to simultaneously expand our business, maintain a conservative, durable balance sheet, and return capital to stockholders, which has in turn resulted in strong equity returns.
⟦s004255⟧ We intend to continue utilizing a nimble and balanced capital allocation strategy that prioritizes the growth of our platform, increased profitability, and the strength of our balance sheet while targeting a consistent, high return on equity for our stockholders.
⟦s004256⟧ This allows us to maintain long-term balance sheet durability to withstand multiple cycles and to execute operational and acquisition strategies when access to capital is scarce.
⟦s004257⟧ We believe this offering will diversify our access to capital and enhance our already strong liquidity position, further supporting our robust future growth plans and providing us with the flexibility to opportunistically deploy capital.
⟦s004258⟧ We plan to continue to be prudent with our use of leverage, which we believe is key to the long-term growth and financial stability of our business.
⟦s004259⟧ Our products and customers Our homes and homebuyers We design, sell, and build a range of single-family homes in each of our markets, with a core focus on the entry-level and empty-nest homebuyer segments.
⟦s004260⟧ Our business is driven by our commitment to building high quality homes at affordable prices in attractive locations while delivering an exceptional level of customer service through providing the flexibility to choose from a wide selection of floor plans, finishes, and upgrades to best fit their tastes and needs.
⟦s004261⟧ We strive to be the most cost-effective provider of homes in each of our submarkets with price points below FHA limits.
⟦s004262⟧ Although we are more cost-effective than most of our competitors, we believe we offer our homebuyers an affordable luxury homebuying experience that is unique compared to our peers and the resale homes with which we compete.
⟦s004263⟧ We offer a variety of floor plans ranging from 1,100 square feet to over 3,000 square feet.
⟦s004264⟧ Our plan library includes popular open-concept homes with single-level living, modern villas, and townhomes, and functional two and three-story homes, with extra space for conveniences like laundry, flex offices, and lofts upstairs.
⟦s004265⟧ Although we have a wide array of plans in our library, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, over 93% of our home closings were from less than 30 house plans.
⟦s004266⟧ Most of our homes are available at a variety of elevations, allowing us to create different and appealing streetscapes across our communities with a streamlined lineup of floor plans.

⟦s004281⟧ Land acquisition strategy Locating and acquiring quality land positions is critical to our overall success and profitability.
⟦s004282⟧ We generally aim to maintain a four-year finished lot supply in all our markets, although we may adjust our targets based on macroeconomic and market-specific trends.
⟦s004283⟧ We utilize a comprehensive underwriting process that includes reviewing the key economic drivers in a particular market, including population, demographic, and employment trends, in order to determine appropriate positioning in the market and the probability of success.
⟦s004284⟧ We typically get a “first look” at many quality land opportunities in our existing and target markets due to our reputation and local relationships with land sellers and brokers.
⟦s004285⟧ Our land selection process starts with our local division leadership.
⟦s004286⟧ Each division has a team of qualified and experienced land managers and support personnel to identify potential new community opportunities within their markets.
⟦s004287⟧ Our divisions work with senior management throughout the underwriting process and are given the authority to put deals under contract with refundable deposits.
⟦s004288⟧ Prior to the expiration of our negotiated inspection period, the division leadership presents each land acquisition opportunity to the Corporate Investment Committee (the “CIC”).
⟦s004289⟧ The CIC consists of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Executive Vice President of Sales & Marketing, Corporate Vice President of Operations, and other members of senior management.
⟦s004290⟧ All land opportunities are presented to it by our divisions and reviewed by the CIC.
⟦s004291⟧ Typically, multiple members of our senior management team have physically toured every new deal location before the deal is presented and reviewed by the CIC.
⟦s004292⟧ The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with input from the other CIC members, approve all new deals.
⟦s004293⟧ We operate a land-light and capital efficient lot acquisition strategy and generally seek to avoid engaging in land development, which requires significant capital expenditures and can take several years to realize returns on investment.
⟦s004294⟧ Our strategy is intended to avoid the financial commitments and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development by allowing us to control a significant number of lots for a relatively low capital 148

⟦s004296⟧ Begin Page 161
⟦s004297⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS cost.
⟦s004298⟧ We consider a lot controlled when we hold an option to acquire the applicable lot for the relevant timeframe set forth in the option contract.
⟦s004299⟧ We primarily employ two variations of our land-light land financing strategy—finished lot option contracts and land bank option contracts—pursuant to which we secure the right to purchase finished lots at market prices from various land sellers and land bank partners, including through our unconsolidated entities, by paying deposits based on the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots (typically ranging between 5.
⟦s004300⟧ 0-20.
⟦s004301⟧ 0%) and, in the case of land bank option contracts, interest on the price of the outstanding lots to the land bank partner.
⟦s004302⟧ After we sign a finished lot option contract, but prior to the deposit becoming non-refundable (except for certain circumstances such as seller default or force majeure events), we have an initial inspection and due diligence period (“Inspection Period”).
⟦s004303⟧ The Inspection Period is typically 60-120 days, during which time we inspect the property to make sure it meets certain development requirements (e.g.
⟦s004304⟧ , zoning, environmental approvals, and other customary requirements).
⟦s004305⟧ If the property meets our development requirements and successfully exits the Inspection Period, the deposit becomes non-refundable (except for certain circumstances such as seller default and force majeure events), and we proceed under the finished lot option contract with the lots available to us for purchase on a staggered takedown schedule, which is designed to mirror our expected home orders.
⟦s004306⟧ Our options to purchase lots typically expire at the end of each purchase date as set forth in the staggered takedown schedule of the applicable option contract.
⟦s004307⟧ For example, if we are a party to an option contract to purchase sixty lots aggregate (fifteen lots to be purchased on each of four staggered, sequential purchase dates), the option for each tranche of fifteen lots would typically expire on the purchase date for the applicable tranche.
⟦s004308⟧ If we do not exercise our option to purchase, the seller then would have the option to terminate the agreement, which would then result in the loss of the option to purchase all remaining unpurchased lots and forfeiture of the remaining deposit for the unpurchased lots.
⟦s004309⟧ We do not typically receive a return of our deposit upon expiration or termination of the contract unless it is due to seller default or a force majeure event.
⟦s004310⟧ Generally, all rights and obligations regarding maintenance, development, taxes, insurance, and any other expenses associated with the properties remain with the seller until we close on the purchase of the lots.
⟦s004311⟧ As of September 30, 2023, our lot deposits relating to lot and land option contracts, including option contracts with unconsolidated entities, totaled $46.
⟦s004312⟧ 7 million, which controlled 10,279 option lots.
⟦s004313⟧ As of December 31, 2022, our lot deposits relating to lot and land option contracts, including option contracts with unconsolidated entities, totaled $33.
⟦s004314⟧ 3 million, which controlled 7,848 option lots.
⟦s004315⟧ When a land seller desires to sell finished lots in bulk or does not wish to develop finished lots, we often enter into land bank option contracts with land bank partners whereby we assign the underlying finished lot option or raw land purchase contract to a land bank partner, who then funds the land development costs and sells the finished lots to us, at our option, over a period of time with staggered takedown schedules.
⟦s004316⟧ These option contracts allow us, at our option, to forfeit our right to purchase the option lots for any reason.
⟦s004317⟧ Our sole legal obligation and economic loss as a result of such forfeitures is limited to the amount of the deposits paid pursuant to such option contracts and any related fees paid to the land bank partner.
⟦s004318⟧ As of September 30, 2023, our land bank deposits amounted to $24.
⟦s004319⟧ 6 million, which controlled 2,335 lots.
⟦s004320⟧ As of December 31, 2022, our land bank deposits amounted to $18.
⟦s004321⟧ 1 million, which controlled 2,097 lots.
⟦s004322⟧ We also have non-controlling equity interests in various investments in unconsolidated entities to acquire rights under options to purchase land to be used in home building operations at future dates.
⟦s004323⟧ We do not consolidate the investments as we do not have a majority ownership interest.
⟦s004324⟧ We also do not have a right to receive a majority of the investment’s expected residual returns or an obligation to absorb a majority of the investment’s expected losses, and we determined we do not exert control over these entities.
⟦s004325⟧ As of September 30, 2023, the total purchase price applicable to land under options was $572.
⟦s004326⟧ 4 million, inclusive of estimated contractual price escalators, which controlled 10,279 lots.
⟦s004327⟧ As of December 31, 2022, the total purchase price applicable to land under options was $423.
⟦s004328⟧ 3 million, inclusive of estimated contractual price escalators, which controlled 7,848 lots.
⟦s004329⟧ As part of our land acquisition strategy and in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of lots, we also enter into agreements with lot sellers, which allow us to evaluate the land and potential transaction without entering into a binding agreement to control the lots or requiring us to pay a non-refundable deposit.
⟦s004330⟧ As of September 30, 2023, we have signed agreements covering 2,861 lots included in our total controlled lots which we are still in the due diligence and investigation period and for which our earnest money deposits are still refundable.

⟦s004336⟧ Our homebuyer-centric homebuilding process begins with a variety of floor plans.
⟦s004337⟧ Our architectural design team improves these plans over time based on homebuyer buying trends in our markets while offering a wide range of materials and upgrades to meet the varying needs of entry-level and empty-nest homebuyers.
⟦s004338⟧ We believe every home is important, regardless of price, and that every homebuyer deserves the chance to personalize in order to build a home that suits their needs.
⟦s004339⟧ Accordingly, we offer an array 150
⟦s004340⟧ End Page 162
⟦s004341⟧ Begin Page 163
⟦s004342⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS of personalization options to our homebuyers in the majority of our product offerings, including cabinetry, countertops, fixtures, home automation and other technologies, energy efficiency, appliances, and flooring, as well as certain structural modifications.
⟦s004343⟧ We empower our homebuyers with the flexibility to visualize, experience, and select these personalization options for their future homes, both at our community sales centers in collaboration with our sales and design consultants, and also virtually using our Interactive Home Designer tools.
⟦s004344⟧ This process affords our homebuyers the opportunity to work with our sales and design consultants or to use interactive tools to make their new house feel like home.
⟦s004345⟧ We provide direct oversight in the construction of our homes.
⟦s004346⟧ Our employees provide the purchasing, construction management, and quality assurance support on the homes we build while independent, third-party trade partners provide the material and labor services.
⟦s004347⟧ Our construction managers oversee construction, manage trade partner adherence to the SMART Builder generated construction schedule, review the work for budget adherence, and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes.
⟦s004348⟧ At all stages of construction, are focused on meeting our production schedules and quality standards.
⟦s004349⟧ We typically do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials, except for work in progress materials for our homes under construction.
⟦s004350⟧ Our trade partner agreements require our trade partners to complete specified work in accordance with price and time schedules and in compliance with applicable building codes and laws.
⟦s004351⟧ All our trade partners are required to carry appropriate types and levels of insurance, as well as any required licenses.
⟦s004352⟧ The price schedules provided by our trade partners may be subject to change based on the fluctuations in labor and material costs or for other reasons.
⟦s004353⟧ Our homes are typically completed within 64 business days from the start of construction but completion may vary based on several factors including the availability of labor, materials, and supplies, and weather conditions.
⟦s004354⟧ We hire experienced trade partners to supply labor and procure some or all the building materials required for homebuilding.
⟦s004355⟧ As is typical in the homebuilding industry, we generally do not have long-term contractual commitments with our trade partners or suppliers.
⟦s004356⟧ However, we maintain long-standing, mutually beneficial relationships with many of them, and we leverage our size and extensive relationships to maximize efficiencies, achieve cost savings, and ensure consistent practices.
⟦s004357⟧ We compete with other homebuilders for qualified construction managers, trade partners, and raw materials.
⟦s004358⟧ SMART Builder and Rteam We incorporate technology into our construction process through SMART Builder, a customized enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system that is a schedule driven, real time, single data base, customized construction and homebuyer relationship management software and the backbone of our process.
⟦s004359⟧ Through SMART Builder, we manage our construction process and work-flow scheduling in real-time with our trade partners.
⟦s004360⟧ This gives those involved in the construction process access to information such as home starts and closings, potential delays, and other issues, as they happen, which maximizes efficiency in the construction process and reduces time and materials waste.
⟦s004361⟧ SMART Builder utilizes a paperless purchase order system throughout the construction process to conduct business with our trade partners and provides them cloud-based access to check their job schedules and purchase orders on a real-time basis.
⟦s004362⟧ Typically, our trade partners are paid every week to ensure regularity and commitment to our shared objectives and all of our trade partners and suppliers are paid via direct deposit, further automating and streamlining the process.
⟦s004363⟧ SMART Builder is the pillar of our Rteam operational model, which views each portion of the home building, selling, and servicing process as integral to every other portion.
⟦s004364⟧ Our Rteam model enhances collaboration, visibility, and mutual accountability between us and the stakeholders with whom we do business, including our developers, municipalities, trade partners, and homebuyers.
⟦s004365⟧ To the extent possible, we structure each Rteam of trade partners within close geographic proximity, creating a more cohesive and efficient working relationship.
⟦s004366⟧ Within each Rteam, every trade partner is responsible for ensuring the job is complete before handing it off to the next trade partner and not starting a job until the specifications, as designated by the team, are correct.
⟦s004367⟧ This relationship-based approach to doing business has the goal of creating better quality homes, a more consistent and predictable homebuilding cycle, and increased profitability.
⟦s004368⟧ We define Rteam with these key themes and train our trade partners on this philosophy: • Real Time • Readiness & responsibility 151
⟦s004369⟧ End Page 163
⟦s004370⟧ Begin Page 164
⟦s004371⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS • Respect • Repeatable & responsible growth • Reliable workmanship • Recession resistant • Recognition Each Rteam is structured to produce one home start per day.
⟦s004372⟧ After accounting for holidays, weather, and other unexpected events, the goal of each Rteam is to start and deliver 208 homes per year, or a minimum of four per week, on an even-flow basis.
⟦s004373⟧ Our aim is for each of our divisions to operate multiple Rteams as we drive scale through our markets.
⟦s004374⟧ Marketing We generally target and market our homes and communities to entry-level and empty-nest homebuyers, which we believe are the most underserved homebuyers groups in each of our markets.
⟦s004375⟧ Our sales, marketing, and architectural design teams work with our forward planning and land teams in each division to secure lots that permit the building of floor plans we believe will appeal to our target homebuyers.
⟦s004376⟧ Our sales and marketing program employs a multi-faceted approach to source and attract potential homebuyers.
⟦s004377⟧ While we occasionally utilize traditional printed media, digital marketing is the primary component of our marketing strategy, and we have refined our digital sales efforts in recent years through the work of our dedicated digital sales coordinators as well as our automated homebuyer assistance tools.
⟦s004378⟧ We believe our online marketing efforts have become a key strength of our business, allowing us to reach a broad range of potential homebuyers at relatively low cost compared to traditional advertising platforms.
⟦s004379⟧ In particular, we are focused on capturing potential homebuyers when we are contemplating opening a new community.
⟦s004380⟧ This is enabled by our multi-faceted digital marketing efforts, which include strategic e-marketing to our current database of potential homebuyers, real estate search site campaigns, internet advertising enhanced by search engine marketing and search engine optimization, and campaigns and promotions across an array of social media platforms.
⟦s004381⟧ We target both in-state and out-of-state potential homebuyers.
⟦s004382⟧ Our proficiency with digital marketing and our commitment to meeting the needs of our homebuyers leads to increased use of our virtual home tours and our automated homebuyer assistance tools, which have become increasingly popular and effective marketing and sales strategies.
⟦s004383⟧ Offsite and onsite signage are also used in our communities to advertise our availability and accessibility every day of the week.
⟦s004384⟧ We also develop communications and promotions targeted specifically to the third-party real estate broker network in each of our markets as they are an integral part of our marketing process and impact sales activities in many of our communities.
⟦s004385⟧ During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022, 76% and 74%, respectively of our gross new orders had a third-party broker.
⟦s004386⟧ Our sales efforts are supported by our sales centers which are typically housed within our professionally decorated model homes demonstrating the features of the homes in each of our communities.
⟦s004387⟧ In general, our model homes are distinguished by well-landscaped entryways, digital sales kiosk with touchscreen displays, and design option selection areas for the homebuyer to create their personalized home.
⟦s004388⟧ The sales centers are staffed with in-house commissioned sales personnel who have in-depth knowledge of our products, communities, and the markets in which they work.
⟦s004389⟧ Sales representatives assist potential homebuyers by providing them with basic floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, tours of model homes, and the selection of home personalization options.
⟦s004390⟧ Sales representatives are trained by us and generally have had prior experience selling new homes in the local market.
⟦s004391⟧ We have implemented standard model home design features that offer consistency to homebuyers across all our communities.
⟦s004392⟧ Backlog, orders, and closings Home construction generally does not start without a binding sales agreement; however, we employ a limited speculative homebuilding program where we construct a home without an associated contract.
⟦s004393⟧ We continually monitor our unsold homes under construction based on market demand and will typically limit our communities to no more than five unsold homes under construction.
⟦s004394⟧ As of September 30, 2023, we had 175 unsold homes under construction, only 23 of which were completed.

⟦s004398⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS A new sale is reported when the homebuyer has received preliminary mortgage approval through one of our preferred lender relationships and the sales contract has been signed by the homebuyer, approved by us, and secured by a typically non-refundable deposit.
⟦s004399⟧ Furthermore, homebuyers are generally required to pay additional deposit when they select options or upgrade features for their home.
⟦s004400⟧ As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, homebuyer deposits averaged approximately 3% and 4% of the average sales price of our backlog homes.

⟦s004402⟧ Backlog (period end) represents the number of homes in backlog from the previous period plus the number of new home orders generated during the current period minus the number of homes closed during the current period.
⟦s004403⟧ Our backlog at any given time will be affected by cancellations and the number of our active communities.
⟦s004404⟧ Homes in backlog are generally closed within one to six months, although we may experience cancellations of purchase contracts at any time prior to such home closings.
⟦s004405⟧ It is important to note that new home orders, backlog, and cancellation metrics are operational, rather than accounting, data and should be used only as a general gauge to evaluate performance.
⟦s004406⟧ Backlog may be impacted by homebuyer cancellations for various reasons beyond our control.
⟦s004407⟧ We recognize our homebuilding revenue at the time of the closing of a sale, at which time the title to and possession of the property are transferred to the homebuyer.
⟦s004408⟧ If a homebuyer cancels its contract, we typically keep the deposit and record it as income at the time of cancellation.
⟦s004409⟧ We believe the combination of our sales process, affordable and personalized product offering, and our industry leading construction cycle times have led to lower cancellation rates on average compared to our industry peers.
⟦s004410⟧ For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, our cancellation rate was approximately 9%.
⟦s004411⟧ For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our cancellation rate was approximately 11% and 7%, respectively.

⟦s004420⟧ It typically takes us approximately 64 business days to construct a single-family home.
⟦s004421⟧ Our materials are subject to price fluctuations until construction on a home begins, at which point prices for that home are locked in via purchase orders.
⟦s004422⟧ Such price fluctuations may be caused by several factors, including seasonal variation in availability of materials, labor and supply chain disruptions, international trade disputes and resulting tariffs, and increased demand for materials in the markets where we operate.
⟦s004423⟧ See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Factors affecting our results of operations” and “Risk factors—A shortage or increase in the costs of building materials could delay or increase the cost of home construction, which could have an adverse material impact on our business.
⟦s004424⟧ ” in this prospectus for additional information.
⟦s004425⟧ The principal raw materials used in the construction of our homes are lumber and concrete.
⟦s004426⟧ In addition, we use various other materials, including drywall, plumbing, and electrical components.
⟦s004427⟧ Typically, all raw materials and most components used in our business are readily available in the United States.
⟦s004428⟧ Our objective in procurement is to maximize efficiencies at local, regional, and national levels and to consistently utilize established contractual arrangements.
⟦s004429⟧ We employ a comprehensive procurement program that leverages our size and regional presence to achieve attractive cost savings and, whenever possible, to utilize standard products available from multiple suppliers.
⟦s004430⟧ We currently determine national specifications for many of our installed products and with our distributors.
⟦s004431⟧ This helps us streamline our offerings, maintain service levels and delivery commitments, and protect our pricing.
⟦s004432⟧ It also gives us the benefit of complimentary model home products and a pre-negotiated rebate amount.
⟦s004433⟧ We currently have distribution agreements in place for lumber, appliances, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, insulation, stucco, and other supplies.

⟦s004440⟧ Ridgeland Title LLC’s staff includes experienced attorneys, state licensed title agents, escrow officers, and support personnel.
⟦s004441⟧ Closing, escrow, and title insurance is primarily regulated at a state level, requiring that operations be conducted by skilled attorneys and/or licensed title insurance agents.
⟦s004442⟧ Expansion of title operations into other markets is ongoing and consideration of new markets is driven by unit volume, ASP for homes sold in the market, and regulatory compliance environment.
⟦s004443⟧ Ridgeland Title LLC collects fees and risk premiums for closing services, based incrementally on unit price, which are shared by the agent and the underwriter on a pro rata basis for each transaction completed.

⟦s004454⟧ Our people We are extremely proud of our employees and their commitment to collaborating as a team to uphold our values.
⟦s004455⟧ Our purpose is to enhance people’s quality of life, whether that be our associates, homebuyers, or trade partners.
⟦s004456⟧ As of September 30, 2023, we employed 353 full-time employees and 11 part-time employees in the United States.
⟦s004457⟧ None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages.
⟦s004458⟧ We believe we have good relationships with our employees.
⟦s004459⟧ In order to be successful, we encourage each of our employees to embrace our “Our House” philosophy, which holds integrity, people, excellence, teamwork, and continuous improvement as the key values that drive our business.
⟦s004460⟧ To uphold our values, we are intensely focused on maintaining our culture, recruiting, retaining, and incentivizing our employees, and employee development and engagement.
⟦s004461⟧ Our culture We take pride in our collaborative, win-win culture.
⟦s004462⟧ From our sales team to our construction managers, trade partners, and support staff, our team works together to deliver each home.
⟦s004463⟧ This collaboration allows us to provide a superior experience for our homebuyers, because they are part of our team as well.
⟦s004464⟧ Our culture has been recognized by several industry publications, including Great Place to Work Certifications in 2022 and 2023 and recognition on the Fortune Best Workplaces in Construction list in 2022.
⟦s004465⟧ As we continue to grow, we are proactive in ensuring that our foundational purpose, embodied in our “Our House” culture of collaboration, discipline and efficiency is preserved, giving us the ability to continue to recruit, develop, and retain associates and trade partners.
⟦s004466⟧ Customer relations, quality control, and warranty program We pay close attention to the product design process and carefully consider quality and choice of materials to minimize building deficiencies and reduce warranty expenses.
⟦s004467⟧ We require all our vendors and trade partners to adhere to our work quality standards.
⟦s004468⟧ Adherence to these standards is monitored in the ordinary course of business by our construction managers, and we do regular inspections and evaluations of our trade partners to ensure these standards are being met.
⟦s004469⟧ In addition, local governing authorities in all our markets require the homes we build pass a variety of inspections at various stages of construction, including a final inspection in which a certificate of occupancy is issued.
⟦s004470⟧ We also, in certain situations, use professionally licensed engineers to do various inspections on our homes.

⟦s004474⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS We maintain professional staff whose roles include providing a positive experience for each homebuyer throughout the sale, building, closing, and post-closing warranty periods.
⟦s004475⟧ Our quality and service initiatives include multiple homebuyer walkthroughs throughout construction and prior to closing, and homebuyer surveys post-closing.
⟦s004476⟧ We maintain an open line of communication between each homebuyer and our sales and construction teams throughout the homebuying process.
⟦s004477⟧ Each of our homes comes with a limited warranty against certain building defects for one year after closing and a limited warranty against structural claims for ten years after closing.
⟦s004478⟧ We believe our warranty program meets or exceeds those customarily offered in the homebuilding industry.
⟦s004479⟧ The trade partners who perform most of the actual construction of the home also provide us with customary warranties on workmanship.
⟦s004480⟧ Through our online portal, which is integrated with SMART Builder, our homebuyers can easily submit warranty requests post-closing.
⟦s004481⟧ It is our goal to resolve any homebuyer warrantable claims within 14 days of receipt.
⟦s004482⟧ Competition The homebuilding industry is characterized by moderately low barriers to entry.
⟦s004483⟧ Among other things, homebuilders compete for homebuyers, desirable lots, financing, raw materials, and skilled labor.
⟦s004484⟧ Increased competition may prevent us from acquiring attractive lots or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market expansion, or lead to pricing pressures on our homes that may adversely impact our margins and revenues.
⟦s004485⟧ Our competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products and, because they are or may be significantly larger or have greater resources or lower cost of capital than we do, may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future.
⟦s004486⟧ We also compete with other homebuilders that have longstanding relationships with trade partners and suppliers in the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future, and we compete for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing.
⟦s004487⟧ The housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels, prevailing economic conditions, and interest rates.
⟦s004488⟧ Other factors that affect the industry and the demand for new homes include: the availability and cost of land, labor, and materials; changes in consumer preferences; demographic trends; and the availability and interest rates of mortgage finance programs.
⟦s004489⟧ See “Risk factors” for additional information regarding these risks.
⟦s004490⟧ We are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of materials.
⟦s004491⟧ Whenever possible, we attempt to utilize standard products available from multiple sources.
⟦s004492⟧ In the past, such materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply.
⟦s004493⟧ See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Factors affecting our results of operations” in this prospectus for additional information.
⟦s004494⟧ Seasonality The homebuilding industry generally exhibits seasonality.
⟦s004495⟧ We have historically experienced, and in the future expect to continue to experience, variability in our results on a quarterly basis.
⟦s004496⟧ See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Factors affecting our results of operations—Seasonality” in this prospectus for additional information.
⟦s004497⟧ Intellectual property and other proprietary rights To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, and contractual restrictions such as confidentiality agreements and licenses.
⟦s004498⟧ We strive to protect the proprietary information we believe is important to our business.
⟦s004499⟧ We have registered or applied to register certain of our trademarks in the United States.
⟦s004500⟧ We pursue the registration of domain names for websites that we use and consider material to our business.
⟦s004501⟧ While much of the intellectual property we use is owned by us, we also use various third-party licensed software in connection with our business.
⟦s004502⟧ Although we believe these licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business, these licenses typically limit our use of such third-party software to specific uses and for specific time periods.

⟦s004506⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Facilities We are headquartered in Woodstock, Georgia where we lease approximately 13,750 square feet of office space under a lease agreement that expires on August 31, 2028.
⟦s004507⟧ We use this location for our Atlanta Division and corporate employee offices.
⟦s004508⟧ We also lease local offices in the markets in which we conduct homebuilding operations.
⟦s004509⟧ We believe these facilities are sufficient to meet our current and anticipated future needs and that suitable additional space will be available as needed to accommodate expansion of our operations.
⟦s004510⟧ Legal proceedings From time to time, we are subject to mediation, arbitration, litigation, or claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
⟦s004511⟧ The results of any current or future claims or proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and litigation costs, diversion of management resources, reputational harm, and other factors.
⟦s004512⟧ Government regulation and environmental, health, and safety matters We are subject to numerous local, state, federal, and other statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction, and similar matters, which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area.
⟦s004513⟧ Projects that are not entitled may be subject to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development, or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations.
⟦s004514⟧ We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future.
⟦s004515⟧ Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction.
⟦s004516⟧ Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety, and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development.
⟦s004517⟧ We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal, and other statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning the environment, health, and safety, including those governing storm water and surface water management, discharge and releases of pollutants and hazardous materials into the environment, including air, groundwater, subsurface and soil, remediation activities, handling of hazardous materials, protection of wetlands, endangered plant and animal species, sensitive habitats, climate change, and human health and safety.
⟦s004518⟧ In addition, pursuant to such statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations, we are generally required to obtain permits and other approvals from applicable authorities to commence and conduct our development and homebuilding activities.
⟦s004519⟧ The environmental requirements that apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to the site’s location, its present and former uses, and its environmental conditions, including the presence or absence of contamination, wetlands, endangered plant or animal species or sensitive habitats at the site or any nearby or adjoining properties.
⟦s004520⟧ Environmental requirements and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas.
⟦s004521⟧ From time to time, EPA or OSHA and similar federal, state, or local agencies may review land developers’ and homebuilders’ compliance with environmental, health, and safety requirements and may levy fines and penalties, among other sanctions, for failure to comply with such requirements, or impose additional requirements for future compliance because of past failures.
⟦s004522⟧ Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs and result in project delays.
⟦s004523⟧ Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders in the future.
⟦s004524⟧ In particular, new legislation has been enacted, or may be enacted in the future, relating to such matters as climate change, energy efficiency standards, requirements for building materials and bans on the use of natural gas appliances and/or natural gas hookups.
⟦s004525⟧ Environmental requirements, including those relating to climate change, can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials, such as lumber, and may increase our energy costs.
⟦s004526⟧ Under various environmental requirements, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up spills or releases of hazardous substances or petroleum products and may be held strictly and/or jointly and severally liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including for property damage, bodily injury, the cost of investigation and cleanup in 157

⟦s004529⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS connection with the contamination, and damages to natural resources.
⟦s004530⟧ We could also be held liable if the past or present use of building materials or fixtures that contain hazardous materials results in site contamination or other damages, such as property damage or bodily injury.
⟦s004531⟧ A mitigation plan may be implemented during the construction of a home if a cleanup does not remove all contaminants of concern or address a naturally occurring condition, such as methane or radon.
⟦s004532⟧ Some homebuyers may not want to purchase a home that is, or that may have been, subject to a mitigation plan.
⟦s004533⟧ In addition, in those cases where wetlands, endangered plant or animal species or sensitive habitats are present, environmental requirements can result in the delay or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas.

⟦s004732⟧ In the event of his death or disability, Mr. Steele would have received a portion of the earned AIP bonus, pro-rated based on the number of full calendar months during which he was employed during the applicable fiscal year.
⟦s004733⟧ Our Board has not yet made determinations regarding annual incentive bonus payments with respect to 2023, but anticipates that such determinations will be made in the first quarter of 2024.
⟦s004734⟧ Such annual incentive amounts for Messrs.
⟦s004735⟧ Devendorf and Steele are reflected above in the “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation Table.
⟦s004736⟧ Pursuant to his existing employment agreement, Mr. Bennett is not eligible to participate in any annual incentive program so long as he directly or indirectly holds any ownership interest in the Company.
⟦s004737⟧ Long-Term Incentives Mr. Devendorf .

⟦s004755⟧ In 2023, Mr. Bennett received an annual non-pro rata distribution in the amount of $750,000 and an additional non-pro rata distribution in the amount of $1,000,000, which amounts are reflected in the “All Other Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation Table.
⟦s004756⟧ Equity compensation plan In connection with this offering, we have adopted, and our stockholders approved, the 2024 Incentive Award Plan (the “2024 Plan”) in order to facilitate the grant of cash and equity incentives to directors, employees (including our named executive officers) and our consultants and certain of our affiliates and to enable us to obtain and retain services of these individuals, which is essential to our long-term success.
⟦s004757⟧ For additional information about the 2024 Plan, please see the section titled “Equity compensation plan” below.
⟦s004758⟧ IPO equity awards Our board of directors has approved the grant of restricted stock unit awards pursuant to the 2024 Plan to certain of our directors and employees, including Messrs.
⟦s004759⟧ Devendorf and Steele, which grants will become effective in connection with the completion of this offering.
⟦s004760⟧ The aggregate dollar-denominated value of the awards to be granted to our employees and directors is approximately $9,220,000.
⟦s004761⟧ Of this amount, the dollar-denominated value of Messrs.
⟦s004762⟧ Devendorf’s and Steele’s awards is $6,000,000 and $150,000, respectively.
⟦s004763⟧ The aggregate number of shares of our Class A common stock that will be subject to the awards will be determined based on the initial public offering price per share of our common stock in this offering.
⟦s004764⟧ The employee awards will vest in full upon the one-year anniversary of the closing date of this offering, subject to the employee’s continued employment; however, Mr. Devendorf’s award will vest in six substantially equal installments on each of the first six anniversaries of the closing date of this offering, subject to his continued employment through the applicable vesting date.
⟦s004765⟧ Additionally, subject to the grantee’s timely execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in our favor, the employee awards will accelerate and vest in full upon a termination of the grantee’s employment by us without “cause” (as defined in the 2024 Plan) or, if the grantee is party to an employment agreement or other individual compensation agreement with us that contains a definition of “good reason”, by the grantee for “good reason” (as defined in the applicable agreement), in either case, that occurs following (or, for Mr. Devendorf, within two years following) a “change in control” (as defined in the 2024 Plan).
⟦s004766⟧ The awards that our non-employee directors will receive are further described under the section titled “Director compensation—Director IPO equity awards” below.
⟦s004767⟧ Mr. Bennett will not be granted an equity award in connection with this offering.
⟦s004768⟧ Other elements of compensation Retirement plans We currently maintain a 401(k) retirement savings plan for our employees, including our named executive officers, who satisfy certain eligibility requirements.
⟦s004769⟧ Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan on the same terms as other full-time employees.
⟦s004770⟧ The Internal Revenue Code allows eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation, within prescribed limits, on a pre-tax basis through contributions to the 401(k) plan.
⟦s004771⟧ Currently, we make safe harbor matching contributions in the 401(k) plan up to a specified percentage of the employee contributions, and these matching contributions are fully vested as of the date on which the contribution is made.
⟦s004772⟧ We believe that providing a vehicle for tax-deferred retirement savings through our 401(k) plan and making fully vested matching contributions adds to the overall desirability of our executive compensation package and further incentivizes our employees, including our named executive officers, in accordance with our compensation policies.
⟦s004773⟧ Health and welfare benefits and perquisites All of our full-time employees, including our named executive officers, are eligible to participate in our health and welfare plans, including medical, dental and vision benefits (including telemedicine and a high-deductible health plan with a health savings account); health and dependent care flexible spending accounts; short-term and long-term disability insurance; critical illness and accident insurance; and life and AD&D insurance.

⟦s004823⟧ 2024 Incentive Award Plan In connection with this offering, we have adopted, and our stockholders approved, the 2024 Plan, under which we may grant cash and equity incentive awards to eligible service providers in order to attract, motivate and retain the talent for which we compete, subject to stockholder approval.
⟦s004824⟧ The material terms of the 2024 Plan are summarized below.
⟦s004825⟧ Eligibility and Administration .
⟦s004826⟧ Our employees, consultants and directors and employees and consultants of our subsidiaries will be eligible to receive awards under the 2024 Plan.
⟦s004827⟧ Following the completion of this offering, the 2024 Plan will be administered by our board of directors with respect to awards to non-employee directors and by our compensation committee with respect to other participants, each of which may delegate its duties and responsibilities to one or more committees of its directors and/or officers (referred to collectively as the plan administrator), subject to the limitations imposed under the 2024 Plan, Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and/or stock exchange rules and other applicable laws.
⟦s004828⟧ The plan administrator will have the authority to take all actions and make all determinations under the 2024 Plan, to interpret the 2024 Plan and award agreements and to adopt, amend and repeal rules for the administration of the 2024 Plan as it deems advisable.
⟦s004829⟧ The plan administrator will also have the authority to determine which eligible service providers receive awards, grant awards, and set the terms and conditions of all awards under the 2024 Plan, including any vesting and vesting acceleration provisions, subject to the conditions and limitations in the 2024 Plan.
⟦s004830⟧ Limitation on Awards and Shares Available .
⟦s004831⟧ The initial aggregate number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 2024 Plan is equal to 4 % of the number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding as of immediately following the completion of this offering (which is expected to be 2,051,282 shares, assuming an initial public offering price of $19.
⟦s004832⟧ 50 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus) .
⟦s004833⟧ In addition, the number of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 2024 Plan will be subject to an annual increase on the first day of each calendar year beginning on and including January 1, 202 5 and ending on and including January 1, 203 4 , equal to the lesser of (A) 1 % of the aggregate number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year and (B) such smaller number of shares as is determined by our board of directors.
⟦s004834⟧ The maximum number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options (“ISOs”) granted under the 2024 Plan, is 10,000,000 .
⟦s004835⟧ Any shares issued pursuant to the 2024 Plan may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued common stock, treasury common stock or common stock purchased on the open market.
⟦s004836⟧ If an award under the 2024 Plan expires, lapses or is terminated, exchanged for, or settled in cash, any shares subject to such award (or portion thereof) may, to the extent of such expiration, lapse, termination, or cash settlement, be used again for new grants under the 2024 Plan.

⟦s004843⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Awards granted under the 2024 Plan upon the assumption of, or in substitution for, awards authorized or outstanding under a qualifying equity plan maintained by an entity with which we enter into a merger or similar corporate transaction will not reduce the shares available for grant under the 2024 Plan but will count against the maximum number of shares that may be issued upon the exercise of ISOs.
⟦s004844⟧ The 2024 Plan provides that the sum of any cash compensation and the aggregate grant date fair value (determined as of the date of the grant under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, or any successor thereto) of all awards granted to a non-employee director as compensation for services as a non-employee director during any fiscal year, or director limit, may not exceed an amount equal to $500,000 (increased to $1,000,000 in the calendar year of a non-employee director’s initial service as a non-employee director or any calendar year during which a non- employee director serves as lead independent director), which limits shall not apply to the compensation for any non-employee director who serves in any capacity in addition to that of a non-employee director for which he or she receives additional compensation or any compensation paid prior to the calendar year following the calendar year in which the 2024 Plan becomes effective.
⟦s004845⟧ Awards .
⟦s004846⟧ The 2024 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, including ISOs and nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), SARs, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and other stock or cash based awards.
⟦s004847⟧ Certain awards under the 2024 Plan may constitute or provide for payment of “nonqualified deferred compensation” under Section 409A of the Code, which may impose additional requirements on the terms and conditions of such awards.
⟦s004848⟧ All awards under the 2024 Plan will be evidenced by award agreements, which will detail the terms and conditions of awards, including any applicable vesting and payment terms and post-termination exercise limitations.
⟦s004849⟧ Awards other than cash awards generally will be settled in shares of our common stock, but the applicable award agreement may provide for cash settlement of any award.
⟦s004850⟧ A brief description of each award type follows.
⟦s004851⟧ • Stock Options and SARs .
⟦s004852⟧ Stock options provide for the purchase of shares of our common stock in the future at an exercise price set on the grant date.
⟦s004853⟧ ISOs, in contrast to NSOs, may provide tax deferral beyond exercise and favorable capital gains tax treatment to their holders if certain holding period and other requirements of the Code are satisfied.
⟦s004854⟧ SARs entitle their holder, upon exercise, to receive from us an amount equal to the appreciation of the shares subject to the award between the grant date and the exercise date.
⟦s004855⟧ Unless otherwise determined by our board, the exercise price of a stock option or SAR may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the underlying share on the grant date (or 110% in the case of ISOs granted to certain significant stockholders), except with respect to certain substitute awards granted in connection with a corporate transaction.
⟦s004856⟧ The term of a stock option or SAR may not be longer than ten years (or five years in the case of ISOs granted to certain significant stockholders).
⟦s004857⟧ Conditions applicable to stock options and/or SARs may be based on continuing service, the attainment of performance goals and/or such other conditions as the plan administrator may determine.
⟦s004858⟧ • Restricted Stock and RSUs .
⟦s004859⟧ Restricted stock is an award of nontransferable shares of our common stock that are subject to certain vesting conditions and other restrictions.
⟦s004860⟧ RSUs are contractual promises to deliver shares of our common stock in the future, which may also remain forfeitable unless and until specified conditions are met and may be accompanied by the right to receive the equivalent value of dividends paid on shares of our common stock prior to the delivery of the underlying shares (i.e.
⟦s004861⟧ , dividend equivalent rights).
⟦s004862⟧ The plan administrator may provide that the delivery of the shares underlying RSUs will be deferred on a mandatory basis or at the election of the participant.
⟦s004863⟧ The terms and conditions applicable to RSUs will be determined by the plan administrator, subject to the conditions and limitations contained in the 2024 Plan.
⟦s004864⟧ Conditions applicable to restricted stock and RSUs may be based on continuing service, the attainment of performance goals and/or such other conditions as the plan administrator may determine.
⟦s004865⟧ • Other Stock or Cash Based Awards .
⟦s004866⟧ Other stock or cash based awards are awards of cash, fully vested shares of our common stock and other awards valued wholly or partially by referring to, or otherwise based on, shares of our common stock.
⟦s004867⟧ Other stock or cash based awards may be granted to participants and may also be available as a payment form in the settlement of other awards, as standalone payments and as payment in lieu of compensation to which a participant is otherwise entitled.
⟦s004868⟧ • Dividend Equivalents .
⟦s004869⟧ Dividend equivalents represent the right to receive the equivalent value of dividends paid on shares of our common stock and may be granted alone or in tandem with awards other than stock options or SARs.
⟦s004870⟧ Dividend equivalents are credited as of the dividend record dates during the period between the date an 171

⟦s004873⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS award is granted and the date such award vests, is exercised, is distributed, or expires, as determined by the plan administrator.
⟦s004874⟧ Dividend equivalents payable with respect to an award prior to the vesting of such award instead will be paid out to the participant only to the extent that the vesting conditions are subsequently satisfied and the award vests.
⟦s004875⟧ Certain transactions.
⟦s004876⟧ The plan administrator has broad discretion to act under the 2024 Plan, as well as make adjustments to the terms and conditions of existing and future awards, to prevent the dilution or enlargement of intended benefits and facilitate necessary or desirable changes in the event of certain transactions and events affecting our common stock, such as stock dividends, stock splits, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations and other corporate transactions.
⟦s004877⟧ In addition, in the event of certain non-reciprocal transactions with our stockholders known as “equity restructurings,” the plan administrator will make equitable adjustments to the 2024 Plan and outstanding awards.
⟦s004878⟧ In the event of a change in control (as defined in the 2024 Plan), to the extent that the surviving entity declines to continue, convert, assume, or replace outstanding awards, then all such awards will become fully vested and exercisable in connection with the transaction.
⟦s004879⟧ Upon or in anticipation of a change in control, the plan administrator may cause any outstanding awards to terminate at a specified time in the future and give the participant the right to exercise such awards during a period of time determined by the plan administrator in its sole discretion.
⟦s004880⟧ Individual award agreements may provide for additional accelerated vesting and payment provisions.
⟦s004881⟧ Repricing .
⟦s004882⟧ Our board of directors may, without approval of the stockholders, reduce the exercise price of any stock option or SAR, or cancel any stock option or SAR in exchange for cash, other awards or stock options or SARs with an exercise price per share that is less than the exercise price per share of the original stock options or SARs.
⟦s004883⟧ Plan Amendment and Termination .
⟦s004884⟧ Our board of directors may amend or terminate the 2024 Plan at any time; however, no amendment, other than an amendment that increases the number of shares available under the 2024 Plan, may materially and adversely affect an award outstanding under the 2024 Plan without the consent of the affected participant, and stockholder approval will be obtained for any amendment to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws.
⟦s004885⟧ The 2024 Plan will remain in effect until terminated by the plan administrator in accordance with the 2024 Plan .
⟦s004886⟧ No awards may be granted under the 2024 Plan after its termination.
⟦s004887⟧ Foreign Participants, Claw-back Provisions, Transferability and Participant Payments .
⟦s004888⟧ The plan administrator may modify award terms, establish subplans and/or adjust other terms and conditions of awards, subject to the share limits described above, in order to facilitate grants of awards subject to the laws and/or stock exchange rules of countries outside of the United States.
⟦s004889⟧ All awards will be subject to any Company clawback policy as set forth in such clawback policy or the applicable award agreement.
⟦s004890⟧ Awards under the 2024 Plan are generally non-transferrable, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or, subject to the plan administrator’s consent, pursuant to a domestic relations order, and are generally exercisable only by the participant.
⟦s004891⟧ With regard to tax withholding, exercise price and purchase price obligations arising in connection with awards under the 2024 Plan, the plan administrator may, in its discretion, accept cash or check, shares of our common stock that meet specified conditions, a “market sell order” or such other consideration as it deems suitable.

⟦s004980⟧ Tax Receivable Agreement As described in “Our organizational structure,” and in “The Transactions” above, we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to purchase newly issued LLC Interests directly from Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and from each Continuing Equity Owner.
⟦s004981⟧ The Continuing Equity Owners immediately following the consummation of the Transactions will be Founder Fund and GSB Holdings, who may, following the consummation of this offering, exchange at each of their respective options, in whole or in part from time to time, their LLC Interests, as applicable, for, at our election (determined solely by our independent directors (within the meaning of the Exchange rules) who are disinterested), cash or newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock as described in this section under “—Smith Douglas LLC Agreement—Agreement in effect upon consummation of the Transactions.
⟦s004982⟧ ” Thomas Bradbury, our Executive Chairman of the board of directors, is co-trustee of Founder Fund and Gregory Bennett, our Chief Executive Officer, and Vice Chairman of our board of directors, is sole member of GSB Holdings.
⟦s004983⟧ As a result of our post-offering organizational structure, Smith Douglas Homes Corp. expects to obtain (i) an allocable share (and increases thereto) of existing tax basis in Smith Douglas Holdings LLC’s assets and tax basis adjustments with respect to such assets resulting from (a) Smith Douglas Homes Corp.’s purchase of LLC Interests from Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and each Continuing Equity Owner in connection with the Transactions, as described under “Use of proceeds,” (b) any future redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests from the Continuing Equity Owners as described under “Certain relationships and related person transactions—Smith Douglas LLC Agreement—Agreement in effect upon consummation of the Transactions—Common unit redemption right,” (c) certain distributions (or deemed distributions) by Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, and (d) payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement; and (ii) certain tax benefits (such as interest deductions) arising from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s004984⟧ We intend to treat any redemption or exchange of LLC Interests for our Class A stock or our cash as our direct purchase of LLC Interests from the Continuing Equity Owners for U.

⟦s004987⟧ Moreover, as a result of the application of the principles of Section 704(c) of the Code and the U.
⟦s004988⟧ S.
⟦s004989⟧ Treasury regulations issued thereunder, which require that items of income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to property owned by Smith Douglas Holdings LLC on the date that we purchase LLC Interests directly from Smith Douglas Holdings LLC with a portion of the proceeds from this offering must be allocated among the members of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC to take into account the difference between the fair market value and the adjusted tax basis of such assets on such date, Smith Douglas Holdings LLC 176
⟦s004990⟧ End Page 188
⟦s004991⟧ Begin Page 189
⟦s004992⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS will be required to make certain special allocations to the Continuing Equity Owners of its items of income and gain attributable to inventory property that exceed their economic pro rata share of such items of income and gain and, as a result, we will be allocated less than our economic pro rata share of such items of income or gain.
⟦s004993⟧ Such Basis Adjustments and Section 704(c) Allocations may have the effect of reducing the amounts we would otherwise pay in the future to various tax authorities and may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those assets.
⟦s004994⟧ In connection with the transactions described above, we will enter into a Tax Receivable Agreement with Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and the Continuing Equity Owners, which we refer to as the Tax Receivable Agreement, that will provide for the payment by Smith Douglas Homes Corp. to the Continuing Equity Owners of 85% of the amount of certain tax benefits, if any, that Smith Douglas Homes Corp. actually realizes, or in some circumstances is deemed to realize, as a result of Basis Adjustments, Section 704(c) Allocations and certain tax benefits (such as interest deductions) arising from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s004995⟧ Smith Douglas Holdings LLC will have in effect an election under Section 754 of the Code, effective for the taxable year that includes the Transactions and each taxable year thereafter.
⟦s004996⟧ These Tax Receivable Agreement payments are not conditioned upon one or more of the Continuing Equity Owners maintaining a continued ownership interest in Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s004997⟧ If a Continuing Equity Owner transfers LLC Interests but does not assign to the transferee of such units its rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement, such Continuing Equity Owner generally will continue to be entitled to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement arising in respect of a subsequent exchange of such LLC Interests.
⟦s004998⟧ In general, the Continuing Equity Owners’ rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement may not be assigned, sold, pledged, or otherwise alienated to any person without such person becoming a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement and agreeing to succeed to the applicable Continuing Equity Owner’s interest therein.
⟦s004999⟧ The actual Basis Adjustments and Section 704(c) Allocations, as well as any amounts paid to the Continuing Equity Owners under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending on a number of factors, including: • the timing of any future redemptions or exchanges —for instance, the increase in any tax deductions will vary depending on the fair value, which may fluctuate over time, of the depreciable or amortizable assets of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC at the time of each redemption, exchange, or distribution (or deemed distribution) as well as the amount of remaining existing tax basis at the time of such redemption, exchange, or distribution (or deemed distribution); • the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the purchases from the Continuing Equity Owners in connection with this offering and any applicable redemptions or exchanges —Basis Adjustments, as well as any related increase in any tax deductions, are directly related to the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of such purchases or future redemptions or exchanges; • the extent to which redemptions or exchanges are taxable —if a redemption or exchange is not taxable for any reason, increased tax deductions will not be available; • the extent to which such Basis Adjustments are immediately deductible —we may be permitted to immediately expense a portion of the Basis Adjustments (e.g.
⟦s005000⟧ , Basis Adjustments related to certain property and equipment that may be subject to accelerated depreciation methods) attributable to a redemption or exchange, which could significantly accelerate the timing of our realization of the associated tax benefits.
⟦s005001⟧ Under the Smith Douglas LLC Agreement, the determination of whether to immediately expense such Basis Adjustments will be made in our sole discretion; and • the amount and timing of our income —the Tax Receivable Agreement generally will require us to pay 85% of the tax benefits as and when those benefits are treated as realized under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s005002⟧ If we do not have sufficient taxable income to realize any of the applicable tax benefits, we generally will not be required (absent a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement, change of control, or other circumstances requiring an early termination payment) to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for that taxable year because no tax benefits will have been actually realized.
⟦s005003⟧ However, any tax benefits that do not result in realized tax benefits in a given taxable year may generate tax attributes that may be utilized to generate tax benefits in previous or future taxable years.
⟦s005004⟧ The utilization of any such tax attributes will result in payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s005005⟧ For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, cash savings in income tax will be computed by comparing our actual income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had there been no 177
⟦s005006⟧ End Page 189
⟦s005007⟧ Begin Page 190
⟦s005008⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Basis Adjustments, Section 704(c) Allocations or additional tax benefits to us as a result of any payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement; provided that, for purposes of determining cash savings with respect to state and local income taxes we will use an assumed tax rate.
⟦s005009⟧ The Tax Receivable Agreement will generally apply to each of our taxable years, beginning with the first taxable year ending after the consummation of the Transactions.
⟦s005010⟧ There is no maximum term for the Tax Receivable Agreement; however, the Tax Receivable Agreement may be terminated by us pursuant to an early termination procedure that requires us to pay the Continuing Equity Owners an agreed-upon amount equal to the estimated present value of the remaining payments to be made under the agreement (calculated with certain assumptions, including regarding tax rates and utilization of Basis Adjustments, Section 704(c) Allocations and additional tax benefits arising from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement).
⟦s005011⟧ The payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are obligations of Smith Douglas Homes Corp. and not of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s005012⟧ Although the actual timing and amount of any payments that we may make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary, we expect the payments we may be required to make to the Continuing Equity Owners could be substantial.
⟦s005013⟧ Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax laws and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we expect the tax savings associated with the purchase of LLC Interests in connection with this offering, together with future redemptions or exchanges of all remaining LLC Interests owned by the Continuing Equity Owners pursuant to the Smith Douglas LLC Agreement as described above, would aggregate to approximately $215.
⟦s005014⟧ 8 million over 26 years from the date of this offering based on the assumed initial public offering price of $19.
⟦s005015⟧ 50 per share of our Class A common stock, which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and assuming all redemptions or exchanges would occur immediately after the initial public offering.
⟦s005016⟧ Under such scenario, assuming future payments are made on the date each relevant tax return is due, without extensions, we would be required to pay approximately 85% of such amount, or approximately $183.
⟦s005017⟧ 5 million over the 26-year period from the date of this offering.
⟦s005018⟧ The actual amounts we will be required to pay under the Tax Receivable Agreement will depend on, among other things, the timing of subsequent redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests by the Continuing Equity Owners, the price of our shares of Class A common stock at the time of each such redemption or exchange, and the amounts and timing of our future taxable income, and may be significantly different from the amounts described in the preceding sentence.
⟦s005019⟧ Any payments made by us to the Continuing Equity Owners under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us or to Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and, to the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and, therefore, may accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s005020⟧ We anticipate funding ordinary course payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement from cash flow from operations of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, available cash, or available borrowings under any future debt agreements.
⟦s005021⟧ Decisions made by us in the course of running our business, such as with respect to mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations, or other changes in control, may influence the timing and amount of payments we pay to a redeeming Continuing Equity Owner under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s005022⟧ For example, the disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition transaction may accelerate payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and increase the present value of such payments.
⟦s005023⟧ The Tax Receivable Agreement provides that if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control were to occur, if we materially breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then the Tax Receivable Agreement will terminate and our obligations, or our successor’s obligations, under the Tax Receivable Agreement would accelerate and become due and payable, based on certain assumptions (including that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all potential tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement).
⟦s005024⟧ In those circumstances, Continuing Equity Owners would be deemed to exchange any remaining outstanding LLC Interests for Class A common stock and generally would be entitled to an immediate cash payment under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of such deemed exchanges.
⟦s005025⟧ We may elect to completely terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early only with the written approval of each of a majority of our “independent directors” (within the meaning of Rule 10A-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Exchange rules).

⟦s005029⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS As a result of the foregoing, we could be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits.
⟦s005030⟧ We also could be required to make cash payments to the Continuing Equity Owners that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s005031⟧ In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control.
⟦s005032⟧ For example, should we elect to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement immediately following this offering, assuming no material changes in the relevant tax laws or tax rates, we estimate that the aggregate termination payments payable to the Continuing Equity Owners would be approximately $88.
⟦s005033⟧ 4 million, consisting of $79.
⟦s005034⟧ 5 payable to the Founder Fund and $8.
⟦s005035⟧ 9 payable to GSB Holdings, based on the assumed initial public offering price of $19.
⟦s005036⟧ 50 per share of our Class A common stock, which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and assuming the discount rate were to be 10.
⟦s005037⟧ 31%.
⟦s005038⟧ We intend to fund any obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement with cash from operations, including cash from distributions from Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s005039⟧ We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.
⟦s005040⟧ There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s005041⟧ See “Risk factors—Risks related to our organizational structure—In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the Continuing Equity Owners may be accelerated or significantly exceed any actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.
⟦s005042⟧ ” Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine.
⟦s005043⟧ We will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the Continuing Equity Owners pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits initially claimed by us are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and ultimately disallowed.
⟦s005044⟧ Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to a Continuing Equity Owner will be netted against future cash payments, if any, we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement to such Continuing Equity Owner.
⟦s005045⟧ However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments, if any, we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement and, as a result, there might not be future cash payments from which to net against.
⟦s005046⟧ The applicable U.
⟦s005047⟧ S.
⟦s005048⟧ federal income tax rules are complex and factual in nature, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not disagree with our tax reporting positions.
⟦s005049⟧ As a result, it is possible we could make cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings.
⟦s005050⟧ We will have full responsibility for, and sole discretion over, all our tax matters, including the filing and amendment of all tax returns and claims for refund and defense of all tax contests, subject to certain participation and approval rights held by the Continuing Equity Owners.
⟦s005051⟧ If the outcome of any challenge to all or part of the Basis Adjustments, Section 704(c) Allocations or other tax benefits we claim would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the rights and obligations of the Continuing Equity Owners in any material respect under the Tax Receivable Agreement, then we will not be permitted to settle such challenge without the consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Continuing Equity Owners, as applicable.
⟦s005052⟧ The interests of the Continuing Equity Owners in any such challenge may differ from or conflict with our interests and your interests, and the Continuing Equity Owners may exercise their consent rights relating to any such challenge in a manner adverse to our interests and your interests.
⟦s005053⟧ The Tax Receivable Agreement requires us to provide the Continuing Equity Owners with a schedule showing the calculation of payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement.

⟦s005063⟧ Smith Douglas LLC Agreement Agreement in effect before consummation of the Transactions Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and the Continuing Equity Owners are currently parties to the Operating Agreement of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, dated as of September 21, 2023, as amended from time to time, which governs the business operations of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and defines the relative rights and privileges associated with the existing units of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s005064⟧ We refer to this agreement, as amended, as the Existing LLC Agreement.
⟦s005065⟧ Under the Existing LLC Agreement, the board of managers of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC has the sole and exclusive right and authority to manage and control the business and affairs of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, and the day-to-day business operations of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC are overseen and implemented by officers of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s005066⟧ Each Original Equity Owner’s rights under the Existing LLC Agreement continue until the effective time of the new Smith Douglas Holdings LLC operating agreement to be adopted in connection with the Transactions, as described below, at which time the Continuing Equity Owners will continue as members that hold LLC Interests with the respective rights thereunder.

⟦s005071⟧ As such, we, through our officers and directors, will be responsible for all operational and administrative decisions of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and daily management of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC’s business.
⟦s005072⟧ Pursuant to the terms of the Smith Douglas LLC Agreement, we cannot be removed or replaced as the sole manager of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC except by our resignation, which may be given at any time by written notice to the members.
⟦s005073⟧ Compensation, fees, and expenses.
⟦s005074⟧ We will not be entitled to compensation for our services as the manager of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.
⟦s005075⟧ We will be entitled to reimbursement by Smith Douglas Holdings LLC for reasonable fees and expenses incurred on behalf of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, including all expenses associated with the Transactions, any subsequent offering of our Class A common stock, being a public company, and maintaining our corporate existence.
⟦s005076⟧ Distributions.
⟦s005077⟧ The Smith Douglas LLC Agreement will require “tax distributions” (as that term is used in the agreement) to be made by Smith Douglas Holdings LLC to its members, except to the extent such distributions would render Smith Douglas Holdings LLC insolvent or are otherwise prohibited by law or any of our future debt agreements.
⟦s005078⟧ Tax distributions will be made on a quarterly basis to each member of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC, including us, pro rata in accordance with economic interests and based on such member’s allocable share of the taxable income of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and an assumed tax rate that will be determined by us, as described below.
⟦s005079⟧ For this purpose, each member’s allocable share of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC’s taxable income shall be net of its allocable share of taxable losses of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and our share of tax distributions shall be in amounts that permit us to satisfy our tax liabilities and our ordinary course payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.

⟦s005094⟧ The Smith Douglas LLC Agreement provides that, in the event that a tender offer, share exchange offer, issuer bid, take-over bid, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to our Class A common stock, each of which we refer to as a “Pubco Offer,” is approved by our board of directors or otherwise effected or to be effected with the consent or approval of our board of directors, each holder of LLC Interests (other than Smith Douglas Homes Corp. and its subsidiaries) shall be permitted to participate in such Pubco Offer by delivering a written notice, which shall be effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the consummation of such Pubco Offer.

⟦s005104⟧ This ratio requirement disregards (1) shares of our Class A common stock under unvested options issued by us, (2) treasury stock and (3) preferred stock or other debt or equity securities (including warrants, options or rights) issued by us that are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock, except to the extent we have contributed the net proceeds from such other securities, including any exercise or purchase price payable upon conversion, exercise or exchange thereof, to the equity capital of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC.

⟦s005111⟧ Smith Douglas Holdings LLC is prohibited from undertaking any subdivision (by any split of units, distribution of units, reclassification, recapitalization or similar event) or combination (by reverse split of units, reclassification, recapitalization or similar event) of the LLC Interests that is not accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination of (1) our Class A common stock to maintain at all times a one-to-one ratio between the number of LLC Interests owned by us and the number of outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and (2) our Class B common stock to maintain at all times a one-to-one ratio between the number of LLC Interests owned by the Continuing Equity Owners and the number of outstanding shares of our Class B common stock.

⟦s005130⟧ In connection with the exercise of the redemption or exchange of LLC Interests (1) the Continuing Equity Owners will be required to surrender a number of shares of our Class B common stock registered in the name of such redeeming or exchanging Continuing Equity Owner, and therefore, will automatically be transferred to us and will be canceled for no consideration on a one-for-one basis with the number of LLC Interests so redeemed or exchanged and (2) all redeeming members will surrender LLC Interests to Smith Douglas Holdings LLC for cancellation.
⟦s005131⟧ Each Continuing Equity Owner’s redemption rights will be subject to certain customary limitations, including the expiration of any contractual lock-up period relating to the shares of our Class A common stock that may be applicable to such Continuing Equity Owner and the absence of any liens or encumbrances on such LLC Interests redeemed.
⟦s005132⟧ Additionally, in the case we elect a cash settlement, such Continuing Equity Owner may rescind its redemption request within a specified period of time.
⟦s005133⟧ Moreover, in the case of a settlement in Class A common stock, such redemption may be conditioned on the closing of an underwritten distribution of the shares of Class A common stock, which may be issued in connection with such proposed redemption.
⟦s005134⟧ In the case of a settlement in Class A common stock, such Continuing Equity Owner may also revoke or delay its redemption request if the following conditions exist: (1) any registration statement pursuant to which the resale of the Class A common stock to be registered for such Continuing Equity Owner at or immediately following the consummation of the redemption shall have ceased to be effective pursuant to any action or inaction by the SEC or no such resale registration statement has yet become effective; (2) we failed to cause any related prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus supplement necessary to effect such redemption or resale of the Class A common stock; (3) we exercised our right to defer, delay or suspend the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement and such deferral, delay or suspension shall affect the ability of such Continuing Equity Owner to have its Class A common stock registered at or immediately following the consummation of the redemption or to have our Class A common stock resold; (4) such Continuing Equity Owner is in possession of any material non-public information concerning us, the receipt of which results in such Continuing Equity Owner being prohibited or restricted from selling Class A common stock at or immediately following the redemption or resale of its Class A common stock without disclosure of such information (and we do not permit disclosure); (5) any stop order relating to the registration statement pursuant to which the Class A common stock was to be registered by such Continuing Equity Owner at or immediately following the redemption shall have been issued by the SEC; (6) there shall have occurred a material disruption in the securities markets generally or in the market or markets in which the Class A common stock is then traded; (7) there shall be in effect an injunction, a restraining order or a decree of any nature of any governmental entity that restrains or prohibits the redemption; (8) we shall have failed to comply in all material respects with our obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, and such failure shall have affected the ability of such Continuing Equity Owner to consummate the resale of the Class A common stock to be received upon such redemption pursuant to an effective registration statement; (9) the redemption date would occur during a black-out period; or (10) such Continuing Equity Owner so elects by written to Smith Douglas Holdings LLC no later than three business days prior to the scheduled redemption date.
⟦s005135⟧ The Smith Douglas LLC Agreement will require that in the case of a redemption by a Continuing Equity Owner we contribute cash, shares of our Class A common stock, to Smith Douglas Holdings LLC in exchange for an amount of newly-issued LLC Interests that will be issued to us equal to the number of LLC Interests redeemed from the Continuing Equity Owner.
⟦s005136⟧ Smith Douglas Holdings LLC will then distribute the cash or shares of our Class A common stock, as applicable, to such Continuing Equity Owner to complete the redemption.
⟦s005137⟧ In the event of an election by a Continuing Equity Owner, we may, at our option, effect a direct exchange by Smith Douglas Homes Corp. of cash, our Class A common stock, for such LLC Interests in lieu of such a redemption.
⟦s005138⟧ Whether by redemption or exchange, we are obligated to ensure that at all times the number of LLC Interests that we own equals the number of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock (subject to certain exceptions for treasury shares and shares underlying certain convertible or exchangeable securities).

⟦s005140⟧ In addition to certain other requirements, our consent, as manager, and the consent of members holding a majority of the LLC Interests then outstanding and entitled to vote (excluding LLC Interests held directly or indirectly by us) will generally be required to amend or modify the Smith Douglas LLC Agreement.

⟦s005208⟧ If advance audit committee approval of a related person transaction requiring the audit committee’s approval is not feasible, then the transaction may be preliminarily entered into by management upon prior approval of the transaction by the Chair of the audit committee subject to ratification of the transaction by the audit committee at the audit committee’s next regularly scheduled meeting; provided, that if ratification is not forthcoming, management will make all reasonable efforts to cancel or annul the transaction.

⟦s005210⟧ Management will be required to update the audit committee as to any material changes to any approved or ratified related person transaction and to provide a status report at least annually of all then current related person transactions.

⟦s005293⟧ We urge you to read our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, which are included as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.
⟦s005294⟧ Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws summarized below may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock.
⟦s005295⟧ Common stock Class A common stock Holders of shares of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and on which the holders of the Class A common stock are entitled to vote.

⟦s005306⟧ Shares of Class B common stock will be issued in the future only to the extent necessary to maintain a one-to-one ratio between the number of LLC Interests held by the Continuing Equity Owners and the number of shares of Class B common stock issued to the Continuing Equity Owners.
⟦s005307⟧ Shares of Class B common stock are transferable only together with an equal number of LLC Interests.
⟦s005308⟧ Only permitted transferees of LLC Interests held by the Continuing Equity Owners will be permitted transferees of Class B common stock.
⟦s005309⟧ See “Certain relationships and related person transactions—Smith Douglas LLC Agreement.

⟦s005311⟧ Holders of shares of our Class B common stock will vote together with holders of our Class A common stock, as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except for certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described below or as otherwise required by applicable law or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
⟦s005312⟧ Except in certain limited circumstances, holders of our Class B common stock do not have any right to receive dividends or to receive a distribution upon dissolution or liquidation.
⟦s005313⟧ Additionally, holders of shares of our Class B common stock do not have preemptive, subscription or redemption rights.
⟦s005314⟧ There will be no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Class B common stock.
⟦s005315⟧ Upon the redemption or exchange of an LLC Interest (together with a share of Class B common stock) for Class A common stock, the shares of Class B common stock will be automatically transferred to Smith Douglas Home Corp. for no consideration and will be canceled and no longer outstanding.
⟦s005316⟧ Such shares of Class B common stock may not be reissued.

⟦s005318⟧ Upon the consummation of the Transactions (including this offering and the proposed use of proceeds), the Continuing Equity Owners will own, in the aggregate, 43,589,743 shares of our Class B common stock, assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock.
⟦s005319⟧ Preferred stock Upon the consummation of the Transactions and the effectiveness of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that will become effective prior to the consummation of the Transactions, the total of our authorized shares of preferred stock will be 10,000,000 shares.
⟦s005320⟧ Upon the consummation of the Transactions, we will have no shares of preferred stock outstanding.
⟦s005321⟧ Under the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that will become effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Transactions, our board of directors is authorized to direct us to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval.
⟦s005322⟧ Our board of directors has the discretion to determine the number and designation of such series and the powers, rights, preferences, privileges, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions, of each series of preferred stock.
⟦s005323⟧ The purpose of authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock and determine its rights and preferences is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific preferred stock issuances.
⟦s005324⟧ The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, future financings, and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, a majority of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock.
⟦s005325⟧ Additionally, the issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the holders of our Class A common stock 189

⟦s005327⟧ Begin Page 202
⟦s005328⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS by restricting dividends on the Class A common stock, diluting the voting power of the Class A common stock, or subordinating the dissolution or liquidation rights of the Class A common stock.
⟦s005329⟧ As a result of these or other factors, the issuance of preferred stock could have an adverse impact on the market price of our Class A common stock.
⟦s005330⟧ Registration rights We intend to enter into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Continuing Equity Owners in connection with this offering pursuant to which such parties will have specified rights to require us to register all or a portion of their shares under the Securities Act.
⟦s005331⟧ See “Certain relationships and related person transactions—Registration Rights Agreement.
⟦s005332⟧ ” Forum selection Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that, unless we otherwise consent in writing, (A) (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, other employees or stockholders to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws (as either may be amended or restated) or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, in the event that the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware); and (B) the federal district courts of the U.
⟦s005333⟧ S.
⟦s005334⟧ shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act; provided, however, that the foregoing choice of forum provision shall not apply to claims seeking to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the U.
⟦s005335⟧ S.
⟦s005336⟧ federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.
⟦s005337⟧ Our amended and restated bylaws will also provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing.
⟦s005338⟧ By agreeing to this provision, however, stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
⟦s005339⟧ Dividends Declaration and payment of any dividend will be subject to the discretion of our board of directors.
⟦s005340⟧ The time and amount of dividends will be dependent upon our business prospects, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, debt repayment obligations, capital expenditure needs, contractual restrictions, covenants in the agreements governing our future indebtedness, industry trends, the provisions of Delaware law affecting the payment of dividends and distributions to stockholders and any other factors our board of directors may consider relevant.
⟦s005341⟧ We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business, and therefore, do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future.
⟦s005342⟧ See “Dividend policy” and “Risk factors—Risks related to this offering and ownership of our Class A common stock—Because we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our Class A common stock following this offering, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.
⟦s005343⟧ ” Anti-takeover provisions Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as they will be in effect prior to the consummation of the Transactions, will contain provisions that may delay, defer, or discourage another party from acquiring control of us.
⟦s005344⟧ We expect that these provisions, which are summarized below, will discourage coercive takeover practices or inadequate takeover bids.
⟦s005345⟧ These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors, which we believe may result in an improvement of the terms of any such acquisition in favor of our stockholders.
⟦s005346⟧ However, they also give our board of directors the power to discourage acquisitions that some stockholders may favor.
⟦s005347⟧ Authorized but unissued shares The authorized but unissued shares of our common stock and our preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the Exchange rules.
⟦s005348⟧ These additional shares 190

⟦s005351⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions, and employee benefit plans and, as described under “Certain relationships and related person transactions—Smith Douglas LLC Agreement—Agreement in effect upon consummation of the Transactions—Common unit redemption right,” funding of redemptions of LLC Interests.
⟦s005352⟧ The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could make more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.
⟦s005353⟧ Board of directors’ vacancies; removal of directors; size of the board Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors, vacant directorships, including newly created seats, shall be filled solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
⟦s005354⟧ Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that directors may be removed with or without cause upon the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class; provided however, from and after the occurrence of the Sunset Date, directors may only be removed with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of capital stock representing at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.
⟦s005355⟧ Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors, the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be permitted to be set only by a resolution adopted by our board of directors.
⟦s005356⟧ These provisions would prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of our board of directors and then gaining control of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees.
⟦s005357⟧ This will make it more difficult to change the composition of our board of directors and will promote continuity of management.
⟦s005358⟧ Stockholder action; special meetings of stockholders Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, prior to the occurrence of the Sunset Date, our stockholders may take action by consent without a meeting, and at any time from and after the occurrence of the Sunset Date, our stockholders may not take action by consent without a meeting, but may only take action at a meeting of stockholders.
⟦s005359⟧ Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will further provide that prior to the Sunset Date, the Secretary (or other officer or our board of directors) at the request of any Continuing Equity Owner owning at least 5% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon may call a special meeting of stockholders, and at any time from and after the occurrence of the Sunset Date, special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority of our board of directors, our Executive Chairman, or our Chief Executive Officer, as applicable, thus prohibiting a stockholder from calling a special meeting.
⟦s005360⟧ These provisions might delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or for stockholders controlling a majority of our capital stock to take any action, including the removal of directors.
⟦s005361⟧ Advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations In addition, our amended and restated bylaws will establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders, including proposed nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors.
⟦s005362⟧ In order for any matter to be “properly brought” before a meeting, a stockholder will have to comply with advance notice and requirements and provide us with certain information in the timeframe set forth in the bylaws.
⟦s005363⟧ Stockholders at an annual meeting may only consider proposals or nominations specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our board of directors or by a qualified stockholder of record on the record date for the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has delivered timely written notice in proper form to our secretary of the stockholder’s intention to bring such business before the meeting.
⟦s005364⟧ These provisions could have the effect of delaying stockholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities until the next stockholder meeting.
⟦s005365⟧ No cumulative voting The DGCL provides that stockholders are not entitled to cumulate votes in the election of directors unless a corporation’s certificate of incorporation provides otherwise.
⟦s005366⟧ Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting.

⟦s005370⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Amendment of certificate of incorporation or bylaws The DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares entitled to vote on the matter is required to amend a corporation’s certificate of incorporation, unless a corporation’s certificate of incorporation requires a greater percentage.
⟦s005371⟧ Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock, voting as a single class, will be required to amend certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including provisions relating to amending our amended and restated bylaws, the size of our board, removal of directors, director and officer liability, vacancies on our board, special meetings, stockholder notices, actions by written consent and exclusive forum.
⟦s005372⟧ Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the board of directors may adopt, amend, alter, or repeal our bylaws.
⟦s005373⟧ In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the stockholders may not adopt, amend, alter or repeal our bylaws unless such action is approved, in addition to any other vote required by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, (a) prior to the Sunset Date, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, or (b) from and after the occurrence of the Sunset Date, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.
⟦s005374⟧ Section 203 of the DGCL We will opt out of Section 203 of the DGCL, and the restrictions and limitations set forth therein.
⟦s005375⟧ However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain provisions that are similar to Section 203 of the DGCL.
⟦s005376⟧ Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, we will not be able to engage in a “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for three years following the time that the person became an interested stockholder, unless the interested stockholder attained such status with the approval of our board of directors, or, upon becoming an interested stockholder, owned at least 85% of the voting power of the outstanding stock or unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.
⟦s005377⟧ A “business combination” includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving us and the “interested stockholder” and the sale of more than 10% of our assets.
⟦s005378⟧ In general, an “interested stockholder” is any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person.
⟦s005379⟧ However, in our case, our Continuing Equity Owners and any of their respective affiliates and any of their respective direct or indirect transferees of our common stock will not be deemed to be “interested stockholders” for the purposes of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation regardless of the percentage of our outstanding voting stock owned by them, and accordingly will not be subject to such restrictions.
⟦s005380⟧ Limitations on liability and indemnification of officers and directors Our amended and restated bylaws provide indemnification for our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.
⟦s005381⟧ Prior to the consummation of the Transactions, we intend to enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers that may, in some cases, be broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained under Delaware law.
⟦s005382⟧ In addition, as permitted by Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes provisions that eliminate the personal liability of our directors and certain officers for monetary damages resulting from breaches of certain fiduciary duties as a director or officer, as applicable.
⟦s005383⟧ These provisions may be held not to be enforceable for violations of the federal securities laws of the U.
⟦s005384⟧ S.
⟦s005385⟧ Corporate opportunity doctrine Delaware law permits corporations to adopt provisions renouncing any interest or expectancy in certain opportunities that are presented to the corporation or its officers, directors, or stockholders.
⟦s005386⟧ Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will, to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by Delaware law, renounce any interest or expectancy that we have in, or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, specified business opportunities that are from time to time presented to any of our directors or stockholders who are not employed by us or our subsidiaries (each such person, an “exempt person”).

⟦s005726⟧ Morgan Securities LLC and BofA Securities, Inc., in their sole discretion, may release the securities subject to any of the lock-up agreements with the underwriters described above, in whole or in part at any time.
⟦s005727⟧ We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
⟦s005728⟧ We intend to apply to have our Class A common stock approved for listing/quotation on the Exchange under the symbol “SDHC.
⟦s005729⟧ ” In connection with this offering, the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions, which involves making bids for, purchasing, and selling shares of Class A common stock in the open market for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Class A common stock while this offering is in progress.
⟦s005730⟧ These stabilizing transactions may include making short sales of Class A common stock, which involves the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares of Class A common stock than they are required to purchase in this offering, and purchasing shares of common stock on the open market to cover positions created by short sales.
⟦s005731⟧ Short sales may be “covered” shorts, which are short positions in an amount not greater than the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock referred to above, or may be “naked” shorts, which are short positions in excess of that amount.
⟦s005732⟧ The underwriters may close out any covered short position either by exercising their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, in whole or in part, or by purchasing shares of Class A common stock in the open market.
⟦s005733⟧ In making this determination, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares of Class A common stock available for purchase in the open market compared to the price at which the underwriters may purchase shares of Class A common stock through the option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock.
⟦s005734⟧ A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Class A common stock in the open market that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering.
⟦s005735⟧ To the extent that the underwriters create a naked short position, they will purchase shares of Class A common stock in the open market to cover the position.
⟦s005736⟧ The underwriters have advised us that, pursuant to Regulation M of the Securities Act, they may also engage in other activities that stabilize, maintain, or otherwise affect the price of the Class A common stock, including the imposition of penalty bids.
⟦s005737⟧ This means that if the representatives of the underwriters purchase shares of Class A common stock in the open market in stabilizing transactions or to cover short sales, the representatives can require the underwriters that sold those shares as part of this offering to repay the underwriting discount received by them.
⟦s005738⟧ These activities may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Class A common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Class A common stock, and, as a result, the price of the Class A common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market.
⟦s005739⟧ If the underwriters commence these activities, they may discontinue them at any time.
⟦s005740⟧ The underwriters may carry out these transactions on the Exchange, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.
⟦s005741⟧ Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A common stock.
⟦s005742⟧ The initial public offering price will be determined by negotiations between us and the representatives of the underwriters.
⟦s005743⟧ In determining the initial public offering price, we and the representatives of the underwriters expect to consider a number of factors including: • the information set forth in this prospectus and otherwise available to the representatives; • our prospects and the history and prospects for the industry in which we compete; • an assessment of our management; • our prospects for future earnings; • the general condition of the securities markets at the time of this offering; • the recent market prices of, and demand for, publicly traded common stock of generally comparable companies; and 203

⟦s006002⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS SMITH DOUGLAS HOLDINGS LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2022 and 2021 Note 1 – Description of business and summary of significant accounting policies: Nature of business Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and Subsidiaries (the Company) is a builder of single-family homes in communities in certain markets in the southeastern United States.
⟦s006003⟧ The Company’s homes and communities are primarily targeted to first-time and empty-nest homebuyers.
⟦s006004⟧ The Company currently operates in metropolitan Atlanta, Birmingham, Charlotte, Huntsville, Nashville, and Raleigh.
⟦s006005⟧ The Company operates a land-light business model whereby the Company typically purchases finished lots via lot-option contracts from various third-party land developers or land bankers.
⟦s006006⟧ Additionally, the Company offers title insurance services through an unconsolidated title company.
⟦s006007⟧ Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.
⟦s006008⟧ S.
⟦s006009⟧ GAAP) and include the accounts of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and those of the consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial interest.
⟦s006010⟧ All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
⟦s006011⟧ Investments in unconsolidated entities in which the Company has less than a controlling financial interest are accounted for using the equity method.
⟦s006012⟧ Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.
⟦s006013⟧ S.
⟦s006014⟧ GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
⟦s006015⟧ Actual results could differ from those estimates.
⟦s006016⟧ Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
⟦s006017⟧ As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the majority of cash and cash equivalents were in demand deposit accounts with major financial institutions.
⟦s006018⟧ At various times throughout the year, the Company may have cash deposited with these financial institutions that exceeds federally insured limits, and the Company could be negatively impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions.
⟦s006019⟧ To date, the Company has experienced no loss or diminished access to cash in its demand deposit accounts.
⟦s006020⟧ Real estate inventory Real estate inventory consists primarily of the capitalized costs of finished homes, homes under construction, and residential lots.
⟦s006021⟧ The Company includes the costs of lot acquisitions, development, direct home construction, capitalized interest, closing costs and direct and certain indirect overhead costs incurred during home construction in real estate inventory.
⟦s006022⟧ Real estate inventory is stated at cost unless the community is determined to be impaired, at which point the inventory is written down to fair value as required by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment .
⟦s006023⟧ The Company reviews its real estate inventory for indicators of potential impairment on a quarterly basis at the community level considering market and economic conditions, current sales absorption rates and recent profitability of new home orders.
⟦s006024⟧ When an indicator of impairment is identified, the Company prepares and analyzes cash flows at the community level on an undiscounted basis.
⟦s006025⟧ If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the community’s carrying value, the Company generally estimates the fair value using the estimated future discounted cash flows of the respective community.
⟦s006026⟧ A community F-13
⟦s006027⟧ End Page 236
⟦s006028⟧ Begin Page 237
⟦s006029⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS with a fair value less than its carrying value is written down to such fair value and resulting losses are reported within cost of home closings in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
⟦s006030⟧ No impairments were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
⟦s006031⟧ Deposits on real estate under option or contract Deposits paid related to land and lot option purchase contracts are recorded and classified as deposits on real estate under option or contract until the related lots are purchased.
⟦s006032⟧ Deposits are reclassified as a component of real estate inventory at the time the deposit is used to offset the acquisition price of the lots based on the terms of the underlying agreements.
⟦s006033⟧ To the extent they are non-refundable, deposits are expensed to cost of home closings if the option agreement is terminated or lot acquisition is no longer considered probable.
⟦s006034⟧ Since the Company’s land and lot option contracts typically do not require specific performance, the Company does not consider such contracts to be contractual obligations to purchase the lots and total exposure to loss under such contracts is limited to non-refundable deposits and any capitalized pre-acquisition costs.
⟦s006035⟧ For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company wrote off $0.
⟦s006036⟧ 4 million of deposits associated with terminated option contracts.
⟦s006037⟧ Such charge is included in cost of home closings in the accompanying 2022 consolidated statement of income.
⟦s006038⟧ There were no deposit write-offs during the year ended December 31, 2021.
⟦s006039⟧ See Note 11 for information on land and lot option contracts.
⟦s006040⟧ Real estate not owned In limited circumstances, the Company may sell finished lots it owns to a land banker and simultaneously enter into an option agreement to repurchase those finished lots.
⟦s006041⟧ In accordance with ASC 606-10-55-70, these transactions are considered a financing arrangement rather than a sale because of the Company’s options to repurchase these parcels at a higher price.
⟦s006042⟧ During 2022 and 2021, the Company sold 148 finished lots at cost for approximately $9.
⟦s006043⟧ 1 million and 68 finished lots at cost for approximately $2.
⟦s006044⟧ 8 million, respectively, to a then member of the Company’s Board of Managers.
⟦s006045⟧ As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately $2.
⟦s006046⟧ 4 million and $1.
⟦s006047⟧ 5 million, respectively, was recorded to real estate not owned, with a corresponding amount of approximately $2.
⟦s006048⟧ 4 million and $1.
⟦s006049⟧ 5 million, respectively, recorded to liabilities related to real estate not owned for the remaining balance of net cash received from the transactions for lots not yet repurchased (see Note 15 for information on transactions with related parties).
⟦s006050⟧ The liabilities related to real estate not owned are excluded from the Company’s debt covenant calculations.
⟦s006051⟧ Investments in unconsolidated entities Investments in unconsolidated entities, in which the Company has an ownership percentage interest or otherwise exercises significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are carried at cost, adjusted for the Company’s proportionate share of earnings or losses and distributions.
⟦s006052⟧ For cash flow classification, to the extent distributions do not exceed cumulative earnings, the Company designates such distributions as return on capital.
⟦s006053⟧ Distributions in excess of cumulative earnings are treated as return of capital.
⟦s006054⟧ The Company regularly reviews its investments in unconsolidated entities to determine whether there is a decline in fair value below book value.
⟦s006055⟧ If there is a decline that is other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to fair value.
⟦s006056⟧ There were no other-than-temporary impairments of investments in unconsolidated entities recognized during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
⟦s006057⟧ Property and equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
⟦s006058⟧ Depreciation is generally recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to five years.
⟦s006059⟧ Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
⟦s006060⟧ Additions and betterments are capitalized.
⟦s006061⟧ The cost of property and equipment sold or otherwise disposed of, and the accumulated depreciation thereon, is eliminated from the property and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts, and gains and losses are reflected in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

⟦s006081⟧ Under this exemption, the Company will not recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets or lease liabilities for those leases that qualify as a short-term lease (a lease term of 12 months of less), which includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition.
⟦s006082⟧ The Company has also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all existing asset classes.
⟦s006083⟧ Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when a home closes with a homebuyer and title and possession of the property are transferred to that homebuyer.
⟦s006084⟧ The Company’s performance obligation, to deliver the home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date.
⟦s006085⟧ When the Company executes sales contracts with its homebuyers, or when it requires advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, the cash deposits received are recorded as contract liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled.
⟦s006086⟧ The Company either retains or refunds to the customer deposits on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.
⟦s006087⟧ As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, customer deposits totaled $9.
⟦s006088⟧ 4 million and $9.

⟦s006094⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS Cost of home closings Cost of home closings includes the costs of lot acquisition, development, direct home construction, capitalized interest, closing costs, direct and certain indirect overhead costs and estimated warranty for the homes.
⟦s006095⟧ Estimates of costs incurred or to be incurred but not paid are accrued and expensed at the time of closing.
⟦s006096⟧ Income taxes The Company operates as a limited liability company and is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes.
⟦s006097⟧ Accordingly, the Company incurs no significant liability for federal or state income taxes, since the taxable income or loss is passed through to its Members.
⟦s006098⟧ The Company incurs liabilities for certain state taxes payable directly by the Company, which are not significant and for which the expense is included in selling, general and administrative costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
⟦s006099⟧ The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits of the position.
⟦s006100⟧ As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no known items which would result in a significant accrual for uncertain tax positions.
⟦s006101⟧ Advertising costs The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred.

⟦s006105⟧ Fair value of financial instruments ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , establishes a framework for measuring fair value and disclosing fair value measurements.
⟦s006106⟧ ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value.
⟦s006107⟧ The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date.
⟦s006108⟧ • Level 1 – Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; • Level 2 – Valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or by model-based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; • Level 3 – Valuation is derived from model-based techniques in which at least one significant input is unobservable and based on the Company’s own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to value the asset or liability.
⟦s006109⟧ A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
⟦s006110⟧ The Company’s assessment of the significance of particular inputs to those fair value measurements requires judgment and considers factors specific to each asset or liability.
⟦s006111⟧ The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, and notes payable.
⟦s006112⟧ The Company has no financial instruments that are required to be reported at fair value in the Company’s financial statements on a recurring or non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the years then ended.
⟦s006113⟧ The Company measures the fair value of its financial instruments for disclosure purposes.
⟦s006114⟧ The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their liquid nature and short-term maturities and are classified as Level 1 fair value instruments.
⟦s006115⟧ The carrying value of the Company’s debt approximates fair value due to variable rate terms that approximate market rates and short-term nature and are classified as Level 2 fair value instruments.
⟦s006116⟧ Recent accounting pronouncements In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), which changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments from an incurred loss approach to F-16

⟦s006175⟧ The Company assesses each of these contracts to determine whether the arrangement contains a lease as defined by ASC Topic 842.
⟦s006176⟧ In order to meet the definition of a lease under ASC Topic 842, the contractual arrangement must convey to the Company the right to control the use of an identifiable asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
⟦s006177⟧ The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
⟦s006178⟧ Some leases contain renewal options and in accordance with ASC Topic 842, the lease term includes those renewals only to the extent that they are reasonably certain to be exercised.
⟦s006179⟧ In accordance with ASC Topic 842, the lease liability is equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments while the ROU asset is based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment, such as for lease incentives.
⟦s006180⟧ The Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit interest rate and, therefore, the Company must estimate its incremental borrowing rate.
⟦s006181⟧ In determining an appropriate incremental borrowing rate, the Company considers the lease period, market interest rates, current interest rates on the Company’s notes payable and the effects of collateralization.

⟦s006206⟧ The Company does not consolidate the investments because the Company does not have a controlling interest in them.
⟦s006207⟧ Note 11 - Variable interest entities: The Company enters into lot option agreements to procure finished lots for the construction of homes in the future.
⟦s006208⟧ Pursuant to these option agreements, the Company generally provides a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase lots at different times in the future at predetermined prices.
⟦s006209⟧ Such contracts enable the Company to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties or unconsolidated entities until the Company has determined whether and when to exercise the option, which may serve to reduce the Company’s financial risks associated with long-term land holdings.
⟦s006210⟧ Based on the provisions of the relevant accounting guidance, the Company has concluded that when it enters into an option or purchase agreement to acquire lots from an entity, a variable interest entity (VIE) may be created.
⟦s006211⟧ The Company evaluates all option and purchase agreements and amendments for land to determine if the related entity is a VIE.
⟦s006212⟧ ASC Topic 810, Consolidation , requires that for each VIE, the Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary.
⟦s006213⟧ In order to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company must first assess whether it has the ability to control the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance.
⟦s006214⟧ Such activities include, but are not limited to, the ability to determine the budget and scope of land development work, if any; the ability to control financing decisions for the VIE; the ability to acquire additional land into the VIE or dispose of land in the VIE not under contract with the Company; and the ability to change or amend the existing option contract with the VIE.

⟦s006218⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
⟦s006219⟧ If the Company has the ability to control such activities, the Company will continue its analysis by determining if the Company is also expected to absorb a potentially significant amount of the VIE’s losses or, if no party absorbs the majority of such losses, if the Company will benefit from a potentially significant amount of the VIE’s expected gains.
⟦s006220⟧ As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company was not identified as the primary beneficiary of any VIEs associated with option and purchase agreements.
⟦s006221⟧ Therefore, no such VIEs required consolidation under ASC Topic 810.
⟦s006222⟧ In all cases, creditors of the entities with which the Company has option agreements have no recourse against the Company and the maximum exposure to loss in option agreements is limited to the Company’s option deposits and any capitalized pre-acquisition costs.
⟦s006223⟧ In certain instances where the Company has entered into option agreements to purchase finished lots from a land banker, the Company may also enter into an agreement to complete the development of the lots on behalf of the land banker at a fixed cost.
⟦s006224⟧ The Company may be at risk for items over budget related to the development of the property under option.
⟦s006225⟧ Any unpaid amounts under these development agreements are recorded as development reimbursement receivables from land bankers and are included in other assets (see Note 1 for information on other assets).
⟦s006226⟧ The following provides a summary of the Company’s interests in land option agreements (in thousands): December 31, 2022 ​ ​ Deposits or investments ​ ​ Remaining purchase price Option contracts ​ ​ $ 33,027 ​ ​ $420,136 Option contracts with unconsolidated entities ​ ​ 319 ​ ​ 3,145 Total option contracts ​ ​ $33,346 ​ ​ $ 423,281 December 31, 2021 ​ ​ Deposits or investments ​ ​ Remaining purchase price Option contracts ​ ​ $24,889 ​ ​ $426,580 Option contracts with unconsolidated entities ​ ​ 2,255 ​ ​ 13,936 Total option contracts ​ ​ $ 27,144 ​ ​ $ 440,516 Deposits on option contracts are included in deposits on real estate under option or contract, and investments in option contracts with unconsolidated entities are included in investments in unconsolidated entities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
⟦s006227⟧ For lot option contracts where the lot seller entity is not required to be consolidated under the variable interest model, the Company considers whether such contracts should be accounted for as financing arrangements.
⟦s006228⟧ Lot option contracts that may be considered financing arrangements include those entered into with third-party land banks or developers in conjunction with such third parties acquiring a specific land parcel(s) on the Company’s behalf, at the Company’s direction, and those with other landowners where the Company or its designee makes improvements to the optioned land parcel(s) during the applicable option period.
⟦s006229⟧ For these lot option contracts, the Company records the remaining purchase price of the associated land parcel(s) in inventories in its consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding financing obligation if the Company determines that it is effectively compelled to exercise the option to purchase the land parcel(s).
⟦s006230⟧ In making this determination with respect to a land option contracts, the Company considers the non-refundable deposit(s), any capitalized pre-acquisition costs and additional costs associated with abandoning the contract.
⟦s006231⟧ As a result of such evaluations of lot option contracts, no lot option contracts were determined to be financing arrangements for which the remaining purchase price should be recorded as a financing obligation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

⟦s006351⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS SMITH DOUGLAS HOLDINGS LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 - Description of business and summary of significant accounting policies: Nature of business Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and Subsidiaries (the Company) is a builder of single-family homes in communities in certain markets in the southeastern and southwestern United States.
⟦s006352⟧ The Company’s homes and communities are primarily targeted to first-time and empty-nest homebuyers.
⟦s006353⟧ The Company currently operates in metropolitan Atlanta, Birmingham, Charlotte, Huntsville, Nashville, Raleigh and Houston (beginning on July 31, 2023 as a result of the acquisition described in Note 16).
⟦s006354⟧ The Company operates a land-light business model whereby the Company typically purchases finished lots via lot-option contracts from various third-party land developers or land bankers.
⟦s006355⟧ Additionally, the Company offers title insurance services through an unconsolidated title company.
⟦s006356⟧ Basis of presentation The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.
⟦s006357⟧ S.
⟦s006358⟧ GAAP) and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information.
⟦s006359⟧ As such, these financial statements do not include all information and footnotes required by U.
⟦s006360⟧ S.
⟦s006361⟧ GAAP for annual financial statements.
⟦s006362⟧ In the opinion of management, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates and for the periods presented.
⟦s006363⟧ These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, which are included elsewhere in this Registration Statement on Form S-1.
⟦s006364⟧ Historically, the homebuilding industry has experienced seasonal fluctuations; therefore, interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year.
⟦s006365⟧ The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Smith Douglas Holdings LLC and those of the consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial interest.
⟦s006366⟧ All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
⟦s006367⟧ Investments in unconsolidated entities in which the Company has less than a controlling financial interest are accounted for using the equity method.
⟦s006368⟧ A reclassification to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and notes has been made to the prior year amount to conform to the current year presentation, which is not material.
⟦s006369⟧ Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.
⟦s006370⟧ S.
⟦s006371⟧ GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
⟦s006372⟧ Actual results could differ from those estimates.
⟦s006373⟧ Business combinations From time to time, the Company may enter into business combinations.
⟦s006374⟧ In accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations , the Company generally recognizes the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of acquisition.
⟦s006375⟧ The Company measures goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
⟦s006376⟧ Goodwill is assigned to each reporting unit based upon the relative fair value of tangible assets acquired.
⟦s006377⟧ The acquisition method of accounting requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of real estate inventory and contingent consideration.

⟦s006381⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS SMITH DOUGLAS HOLDINGS LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value of the acquired real estate inventory include subjective and/or complex judgments regarding items such as estimates of future net proceeds, discount rate, and costs to complete.
⟦s006382⟧ Significant estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value of contingent consideration include subjective and/or complex judgments regarding items such as the gross margin discount rate, gross margin volatility, drift rate, and cost of debt.
⟦s006383⟧ The acquisition method of accounting also requires the Company to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date.
⟦s006384⟧ If the Company is required to adjust provisional amounts that have been recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
⟦s006385⟧ If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, the Company could record future impairment charges.
⟦s006386⟧ Note 16 describes the business combination completed during the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 and the estimates, assumptions used, and areas for which the acquisition accounting is not yet finalized.
⟦s006387⟧ Cash and cash equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
⟦s006388⟧ As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the majority of cash and cash equivalents were in demand deposit accounts with major financial institutions.
⟦s006389⟧ At various times throughout the year, the Company may have cash deposited with these financial institutions that exceeds federally insured limits, and the Company could be negatively impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions.
⟦s006390⟧ To date, the Company has experienced no loss or diminished access to cash in its demand deposit accounts.
⟦s006391⟧ Real estate inventory Real estate inventory consists primarily of the capitalized costs of finished homes, homes under construction, and residential lots.
⟦s006392⟧ The Company includes the costs of lot acquisitions, development, direct home construction, capitalized interest, closing costs and direct and certain indirect overhead costs incurred during home construction in real estate inventory.
⟦s006393⟧ Real estate inventory is stated at cost unless a community is determined to be impaired, at which point the inventory is written down to fair value as required by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment .
⟦s006394⟧ The Company reviews its real estate inventory for indicators of potential impairment on a quarterly basis at the community level considering market and economic conditions, current sales absorption rates and recent profitability of new home sales.
⟦s006395⟧ When an indicator of impairment is identified, the Company prepares and analyzes cash flows at the community level on an undiscounted basis.
⟦s006396⟧ If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the community’s carrying value, the Company generally estimates the fair value using the estimated future discounted cash flows of the respective community.
⟦s006397⟧ A community with a fair value less than its carrying value is written down to such fair value and resulting losses are reported within cost of home closings in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
⟦s006398⟧ No impairments were recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.
⟦s006399⟧ Deposits on real estate under option or contract Deposits paid related to land and lot option purchase contracts are recorded and classified as deposits on real estate under option or contract until the related lots are purchased.
⟦s006400⟧ Deposits are reclassified as a component of real estate inventory at the time the deposit is used to offset the acquisition price of the lots based on the terms of the underlying agreements.
⟦s006401⟧ To the extent they are non-refundable, deposits are expensed to cost of home closings if the option agreement is terminated or lot acquisition is no longer considered probable.

⟦s006406⟧ Since the Company’s land and lot option contracts typically do not require specific performance, the Company does not consider such contracts to be contractual obligations to purchase the lots and total exposure to loss under such contracts is limited to non-refundable deposits and any capitalized pre-acquisition costs.
⟦s006407⟧ See Note 10 for information on land and lot option contracts.
⟦s006408⟧ Real estate not owned In limited circumstances, the Company may sell finished lots it owns to a land banker and simultaneously enter into an option agreement to repurchase those finished lots.
⟦s006409⟧ In accordance with ASC 606-10-55-70, these transactions are considered a financing arrangement rather than a sale because of the Company’s options to repurchase these parcels at a higher price.

⟦s006415⟧ The liabilities related to real estate not owned are excluded from the Company’s debt covenant calculations.
⟦s006416⟧ Investments in unconsolidated entities Investments in unconsolidated entities, in which the Company has an ownership percentage interest or otherwise exercises significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are carried at cost, adjusted for the Company’s proportionate share of earnings or losses and distributions.
⟦s006417⟧ Such investments are included in other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
⟦s006418⟧ For cash flow classification, to the extent distributions do not exceed cumulative earnings, the Company designates such distributions as return on capital.
⟦s006419⟧ Distributions in excess of cumulative earnings are treated as return of capital.
⟦s006420⟧ The Company regularly reviews its investments in unconsolidated entities to determine whether there is a decline in fair value below book value.
⟦s006421⟧ If there is a decline that is other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to fair value.
⟦s006422⟧ There were no other-than-temporary impairments of investments in unconsolidated entities recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.
⟦s006423⟧ Property and equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
⟦s006424⟧ Depreciation is generally recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to five years.

⟦s006441⟧ The Company assesses goodwill for impairment each year as of October 1 and between annual evaluations if events or changes in circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill was assigned below its carrying amount.
⟦s006442⟧ When evaluating goodwill for impairment, the Company may perform the optional qualitative assessment by considering factors including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events.
⟦s006443⟧ If the Company bypasses the qualitative assessment, or if the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company will perform a quantitative impairment testing by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
⟦s006444⟧ As of September 30, 2023, no events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
⟦s006445⟧ Warranty reserves Homebuyers are provided with a limited warranty against certain building defects for up to one year after the home closing and a limited warranty against structural claims for up to 10 years after the home closing.
⟦s006446⟧ The Company estimates the costs to be incurred under these warranties and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized.
⟦s006447⟧ Such costs primarily include repairs of minor construction and cosmetic defects associated with homeowner claims.
⟦s006448⟧ The Company estimates warranty reserves based on historical data and trends for its communities and periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
⟦s006449⟧ Warranty reserves are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, and additions and adjustments to the reserves are included in cost of home closings within the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
⟦s006450⟧ Actual warranty costs could differ from the current estimates.
⟦s006451⟧ Leases ASC Topic 842, Leases , provides practical expedients and accounting policy elections for ongoing lease accounting.
⟦s006452⟧ The Company has elected the recognition exemption for short-term leases for all leases that qualify.
⟦s006453⟧ Under this exemption, the Company will not recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets or lease liabilities for those leases that qualify as a short-term lease (a lease term of 12 months of less), which includes not recognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition.
⟦s006454⟧ The Company has also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all existing asset classes.
⟦s006455⟧ Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when a home closes with a homebuyer and title and possession of the property are transferred to that homebuyer.
⟦s006456⟧ The Company’s performance obligation, to deliver the home, is generally satisfied in less than one year from the original contract date.
⟦s006457⟧ When the Company executes sales contracts with its homebuyers, or when it requires advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, the cash deposits received are F-33

⟦s006466⟧ Cost of home closings Cost of home closings includes the costs of lot acquisition, development, direct home construction, capitalized interest, closing costs, direct and certain indirect overhead costs and estimated warranty for the homes.
⟦s006467⟧ Estimates of costs incurred or to be incurred but not paid are accrued and expensed at the time of closing.
⟦s006468⟧ Income taxes The Company operates as a limited liability company and is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes.
⟦s006469⟧ Accordingly, the Company incurs no significant liability for federal or state income taxes, since the taxable income or loss is passed through to its Members.
⟦s006470⟧ The Company incurs liabilities for certain state taxes payable directly by the Company, which are not significant and for which the expense is included in selling, general and administrative costs in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income.
⟦s006471⟧ The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits of the position.
⟦s006472⟧ As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no known items which would result in a significant accrual for uncertain tax positions.

⟦s006525⟧ Note 8 - Leases: The Company leases certain office space and equipment for use in its operations.
⟦s006526⟧ The Company assesses each of these contracts to determine whether the arrangement contains a lease as defined by ASC Topic 842.
⟦s006527⟧ In order to meet the definition of a lease under ASC Topic 842, the contractual arrangement must convey to the Company the right to control the use of an identifiable asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
⟦s006528⟧ The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
⟦s006529⟧ Some leases contain renewal options and in accordance with ASC Topic 842, the lease term includes those renewals only to the extent that they are reasonably certain to be exercised.
⟦s006530⟧ In accordance with ASC Topic 842, the lease liability is equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments while the ROU asset is based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment, such as for lease incentives.
⟦s006531⟧ The Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit interest rate and, therefore, the Company must estimate its incremental borrowing rate.
⟦s006532⟧ In determining an appropriate incremental borrowing rate, the Company considers the lease period, market interest rates, current interest rates on the Company’s notes payable and the effects of collateralization.
⟦s006533⟧ The Company’s lease population as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is comprised of operating leases where the Company is the lessee, and these leases are primarily for office space for corporate and division offices, as well as certain equipment leases.

⟦s006554⟧ The Company does not consolidate the investments because the Company does not have a controlling interest in them.
⟦s006555⟧ Note 10 - Variable interest entities: The Company enters into lot option agreements to procure finished lots for the construction of homes in the future.
⟦s006556⟧ Pursuant to these option agreements, the Company generally provides a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase lots at different times in the future at predetermined prices.
⟦s006557⟧ Such contracts enable the Company to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties or unconsolidated entities until the Company has determined whether and when to exercise the option, which may serve to reduce the Company’s financial risks associated with long-term land holdings.
⟦s006558⟧ Based on the provisions of the relevant accounting guidance, the Company has concluded that when it enters into an option or purchase agreement to acquire lots from an entity, a variable interest entity (VIE) may be created.
⟦s006559⟧ The Company evaluates all option and purchase agreements and amendments for land to determine if the related entity is a VIE.
⟦s006560⟧ ASC Topic 810, Consolidation , requires that for each VIE, the Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary.
⟦s006561⟧ In order to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company must first assess whether it has the ability to control the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance.
⟦s006562⟧ Such activities include, but are not limited to, the ability to determine the budget and scope of land development work, if any; the ability to control financing decisions for the VIE; the ability to acquire additional land into the VIE or dispose of land in the VIE not under contract with the Company; and the ability to change or amend the existing option contract with the VIE.
⟦s006563⟧ If the Company does not control such activities, the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
⟦s006564⟧ If the Company has the ability to control such activities, the Company will continue its analysis by F-38

⟦s006568⟧ As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company was not identified as the primary beneficiary of any VIEs associated with option and purchase agreements.
⟦s006569⟧ Therefore, no such VIEs required consolidation under ASC Topic 810.
⟦s006570⟧ In all cases, creditors of the entities with which the Company has option agreements have no recourse against the Company and the maximum exposure to loss in option agreements is limited to the Company’s option deposits and any capitalized pre-acquisition costs.
⟦s006571⟧ In certain instances where the Company has entered into option agreements to purchase finished lots from a land banker, the Company may also enter into an agreement to complete the development of the lots on behalf of the land banker at a fixed cost.
⟦s006572⟧ The Company may be at risk for items over budget related to the development of the property under option.
⟦s006573⟧ Any unpaid amounts under these development agreements are recorded as development reimbursement receivables from land bankers and are included in other assets (see Note 1 for information on other assets).

⟦s006576⟧ Lot option contracts that may be considered financing arrangements include those entered into with third-party land banks or developers in conjunction with such third parties acquiring a specific land parcel(s) on the Company’s behalf, at the Company’s direction, and those with other landowners where the Company or its designee makes improvements to the optioned land parcel(s) during the applicable option period.
⟦s006577⟧ For these lot option contracts, the Company records the remaining purchase price of the associated land parcel(s) in inventory in its consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding financing obligation if the Company determines that it is effectively compelled to exercise the option to purchase the land parcel(s).
⟦s006578⟧ In making this determination with respect to a land option contracts, the Company considers the non-refundable deposit(s), any capitalized pre-acquisition costs and additional costs associated with abandoning the contract.
⟦s006579⟧ As a result of such evaluations of lot option contracts, no lot option contracts were determined to be financing arrangements for which the remaining purchase price should be recorded as a financing obligation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

⟦s006712⟧ ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value.
⟦s006713⟧ The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date.
⟦s006714⟧ • Level 1 - Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; • Level 2 - Valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or by model-based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable in the market; • Level 3 - Valuation is derived from model-based techniques in which at least one significant input is unobservable and based on the Company’s own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to value the asset or liability.
⟦s006715⟧ A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
⟦s006716⟧ The Company’s assessment of the significance of particular inputs to those fair value measurements requires judgment and considers factors specific to each asset or liability.
⟦s006717⟧ The Company’s financial instruments measured or disclosed at fair value are summarized below.
⟦s006718⟧ The summary excludes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, all of which had fair values approximating their carrying values due to the liquid nature and short maturities of these instruments.

⟦s006724⟧ The fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Devon Street acquisition was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation to model the likelihood of achieving the agreed-upon gross margin target based on available information as of the acquisition date.
⟦s006725⟧ The valuation methodology includes assumptions and judgments regarding the gross margin discount rate, gross margin volatility, drift rate, and cost of debt, which are primarily Level 3 assumptions.

⟦s006743⟧ Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
⟦s006744⟧ In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
⟦s006745⟧ Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
⟦s006746⟧ Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
⟦s006747⟧ The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
⟦s006748⟧ Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.
⟦s006749⟧ In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we: • Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
⟦s006750⟧ • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks.
⟦s006751⟧ Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
⟦s006752⟧ • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.
⟦s006753⟧ Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

⟦s006757⟧ TABLE OF CONTENTS • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.
⟦s006758⟧ • Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.
⟦s006759⟧ We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

⟦s006924⟧ The partners share in the profits and losses of the partnership in proportion to the amount of partnership interest owned by each.
⟦s006925⟧ No limited partner shall be liable for the debts, obligations or liability of the Company.
⟦s006926⟧ The partnership shall exist until dissolved in accordance with the partnership agreement.
⟦s006927⟧ Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from home sales when a closing occurs.
⟦s006928⟧ A closing is considered to occur when payment has been received or is receivable; title, possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer; and the Company is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale.
⟦s006929⟧ A typical sales contract has a duration of less than a year.
⟦s006930⟧ Performance Obligation The Company contracts with customers to design and construct new single homes.
⟦s006931⟧ Each residential unit is a single performance obligation that is satisfied at the point of closing of the sale.
⟦s006932⟧ Contracts with customers to design and construct new single homes are generally fixed-price, and contracts with customers for residential construction are subject to change orders.
⟦s006933⟧ There is normally no variable consideration.
⟦s006934⟧ Payment in full takes place at the point of closing.
⟦s006935⟧ Cost of Sales The Company’s cost of sales consists of labor, material, and lot costs using the specific identification method.
⟦s006936⟧ Cost of sales also includes interest, property taxes, and indirect costs incurred outside of the development and construction periods.
⟦s006937⟧ Cash Cash is comprised of amounts in demand deposit accounts with financial institutions insured by the FDIC.
⟦s006938⟧ The Company has not experienced any losses from this credit risk.
⟦s006939⟧ Management believes the risk of loss is minimal.
⟦s006940⟧ As of June 30, 2023, the Company had funds on deposit with such financial institutions that exceeded the insured limits by $16,863,415.
⟦s006941⟧ Real Estate Inventories Real estate inventories are stated at the lower of cost (specific identification) or estimated net realizable value.
⟦s006942⟧ Interest, property taxes and indirect costs are capitalized during the development and construction periods.
⟦s006943⟧ Purchase Option Deposits The Company enters into option agreements to acquire lots, for which the Company generally pays non-refundable deposits.
⟦s006944⟧ Provisions included in a limited number of option agreements may call for specific performance from the Company for a limited number of lot purchases.
⟦s006945⟧ In order to require specific performance from the Company, the developer must first have completed development of the lots and must not be in default.
⟦s006946⟧ Generally, these specific performance requirements are fulfilled with the Company’s initial purchase of lots under the contract.
⟦s006947⟧ See independent accountant’s review report.

⟦s007021⟧ In addition, liability will not be eliminated for (i) directors who authorized the payment of a dividend or approved a stock repurchase in violation of Delaware corporate law or (ii) officers in connection with derivative actions.
⟦s007022⟧ We expect to adopt an amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which will become effective immediately prior to the consummation of this offering, and which will provide that none of our directors or officers shall be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability, except to the extent that the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware prohibits the elimination or limitation of liability of directors or officers for breaches of fiduciary duty.
⟦s007023⟧ Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware provides that a corporation has the power to indemnify a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or a person serving at the request of the corporation for another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise in related capacities against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with an action, suit or proceeding to which he or she was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding by reason of such position, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, in any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, except that, in the case of actions brought by or in the right of the corporation, no indemnification shall be made with respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or other adjudicating court determines that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all of the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
⟦s007024⟧ Upon consummation of the Transactions, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will provide indemnification for our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, subject to certain limited exceptions.

⟦s007029⟧ Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will provide that we will indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to an action or suit by or in the right of us to procure a judgment in our favor by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, a director or officer, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at our request as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees) and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, and any appeal therefrom, if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, except that no indemnification shall be made with respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to us, unless a court determines that, despite such adjudication but in view of all of the circumstances, he or she is entitled to indemnification of such expenses.
⟦s007030⟧ Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, he or she will be indemnified by us against all expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection therewith.
⟦s007031⟧ Expenses must be advanced to an Indemnitee under certain circumstances.

⟦s007034⟧ The indemnification agreements will provide for the advancement or payment of all expenses to the indemnitee and for the reimbursement to us if it is found that such indemnitee is not entitled to such indemnification under applicable law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.
⟦s007035⟧ We maintain a general liability insurance policy that covers certain liabilities of directors and officers of our corporation arising out of claims based on acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers.
⟦s007036⟧ In any underwriting agreement we enter into in connection with the sale of common stock being registered hereby, the underwriters will agree to indemnify, under certain conditions, us, our directors, our officers, and persons who control us within the meaning of the Securities Act, against certain liabilities.

⟦s007131⟧ Undertakings.
⟦s007132⟧ (h) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.
⟦s007133⟧ (i) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of Smith Douglas Homes Corp. pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, Smith Douglas Homes Corp. has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
⟦s007134⟧ In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by Smith Douglas Homes Corp. of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of Smith Douglas Homes Corp. in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, Smith Douglas Homes Corp. will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
⟦s007135⟧ (j) The undersigned hereby further undertakes that: (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by Smith Douglas Homes Corp. pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.
⟦s007136⟧ (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
