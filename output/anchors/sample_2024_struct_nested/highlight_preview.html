In exchange for this higher potential yield, you must be willing to accept the risks that (i) your actual yield may be lower than the yield on our conventional debt securities of the same maturity because you may not receive one or more, or any, contingent coupon payments, and (ii) the value of what you receive at maturity may be significantly less than the stated principal amount of your securities, and may be zero.

(1) On the date of this pricing supplement, the estimated value of the securities is $984.50 per security, which is less than the issue price. The estimated value of the securities is based on CGMI’s proprietary pricing models and our internal funding rate. It is not an indication of actual profit to CGMI or other of our affiliates, nor is it an indication of the price, if any, at which CGMI or any other person may be willing to buy the securities from you at any time after issuance. See “Valuation of the Securities” in this pricing supplement.<br>
(2) CGMI will receive an underwriting fee of up to $7.00 for each security sold in this offering. The total underwriting fee and proceeds to issuer in the table above give effect to the actual total underwriting fee. For more information on the distribution of the securities, see “Supplemental Plan of Distribution” in this pricing supplement. In addition to the underwriting fee, CGMI and its affiliates may profit from hedging activity related to this offering, even if the value of the securities declines. See “Use of Proceeds and Hedging” in the accompanying prospectus.<br>
(3) The per security proceeds to issuer indicated above represent the minimum per security proceeds to issuer for any security, assuming the maximum per security underwriting fee. As noted above, the underwriting fee is variable.<br>
Investing in the securities involves risks not associated with an investment in conventional debt securities. See “Summary Risk Factors” beginning on page PS-6.<br>

Hypothetical Examples<br>
The examples in the first section below illustrate how to determine whether a contingent coupon will be paid following a valuation date. The examples in the second section below illustrate how to determine the payment at maturity on the securities, assuming the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity. The examples are solely for illustrative purposes, do not show all possible outcomes and are not a prediction of any payment that may be made on the securities.<br>
The examples below are based on the following hypothetical values and do not reflect the actual initial underlying value, coupon barrier value or final barrier value. For the actual initial underlying value, coupon barrier value and final barrier value, see the cover page of this pricing supplement. We have used these hypothetical values, rather than the actual values, to simplify the calculations and aid understanding of how the securities work. However, you should understand that the actual payments on the securities will be calculated based on the actual initial underlying value, coupon barrier value and final barrier value, and not the hypothetical values indicated below. For ease of analysis, figures below have been rounded.<br>

Example 1:  On the hypothetical valuation date, the closing value of the underlying is greater than the coupon barrier value. As a result, investors in the securities would receive the contingent coupon payment on the related contingent coupon payment date.<br>
Example 2:  On the hypothetical valuation date, the closing value of the underlying is less than the coupon barrier value. As a result, investors would not receive any payment on the related contingent coupon payment date.<br>
Investors in the securities will not receive a contingent coupon on the contingent coupon payment date following a valuation date if the closing value of the underlying on that valuation date is less than the coupon barrier value.<br>
Example 3:  On the hypothetical valuation date, the closing value of the underlying is less than the coupon barrier value. As a result, investors would not receive any payment on the related contingent coupon payment date.<br>

Example 4: The final underlying value is greater than the final barrier value. Accordingly, at maturity, you would receive the stated principal amount of the securities plus  the contingent coupon payment due at maturity, but you would not participate in the appreciation of the underlying.<br>
Example 5:  The final underlying value is less than the final barrier value. Accordingly, at maturity, you would receive a payment per security calculated as follows:<br>
Payment at maturity = $1,000.00 + ($1,000.00 × the underlying return)<br>
= $1,000.00 + ($1,000.00 × -70.00%)<br>
= $1,000.00 + -$700.00<br>
= $300.00<br>
In this scenario, because the final underlying value is less than the final barrier value, you would lose a significant portion of your investment in the securities. In addition, because the final underlying value is below the coupon barrier value, you would not receive any contingent coupon payment at maturity.<br>
Example 6:  The final underlying value is $0.00. Accordingly, at maturity, you would receive a payment per security calculated as follows:<br>
Payment at maturity = $1,000.00 + ($1,000.00 × the underlying return)<br>
= $1,000.00 + ($1,000.00 × -100.00%)<br>
= $1,000.00 + -$1,000.00<br>
= $0.00<br>
In this scenario, you would lose your entire investment in the securities at maturity.<br>
It is possible that the closing value of the underlying will be less than the coupon barrier value on each valuation date and less than the final barrier value on the final valuation date, such that you will not receive any contingent coupon payments over the term of the securities and will receive significantly less than the stated principal amount of your securities, and possibly nothing, at maturity.<br>

Summary Risk Factors<br>
An investment in the securities is significantly riskier than an investment in conventional debt securities. The securities are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in our conventional debt securities (guaranteed by Citigroup Inc.), including the risk that we and Citigroup Inc. may default on our obligations under the securities, and are also subject to risks associated with the underlying. Accordingly, the securities are suitable only for investors who are capable of understanding the complexities and risks of the securities. You should consult your own financial, tax and legal advisors as to the risks of an investment in the securities and the suitability of the securities in light of your particular circumstances.<br>
The following is a summary of certain key risk factors for investors in the securities. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of risks relating to an investment in the securities contained in the section “Risk Factors Relating to the Securities” beginning on page EA-7 in the accompanying product supplement. You should also carefully read the risk factors included in the accompanying prospectus supplement and in the documents incorporated by reference in the accompanying prospectus, including Citigroup Inc.’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which describe risks relating to the business of Citigroup Inc. more generally.<br>

Table 19 Row 1 Col 2 | Row Header: ■ | Column Header: You may lose a significant portion or all of your investment. Unlike conventional debt securities, the securities do not provide for the repayment of the stated principal amount at maturity in all circumstances. If the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity, your payment at maturity will depend on the final underlying value. If the final underlying value is less than the final barrier value, you will lose 1% of the stated principal amount of your securities for every 1% by which the underlying has declined from the initial underlying value. There is no minimum payment at maturity on the securities, and you may lose up to all of your investment.<br>

Table 21 Row 1 Col 2 | Row Header: ■ | Column Header: Higher contingent coupon rates are associated with greater risk. The securities offer contingent coupon payments at an annualized rate that, if all are paid, would produce a yield that is generally higher than the yield on our conventional debt securities of the same maturity. This higher potential yield is associated with greater levels of expected risk as of the pricing date for the securities, including the risk that you may not receive a contingent coupon payment on one or more, or any, contingent coupon payment dates and the risk that the value of what you receive at maturity may be significantly less than the stated principal amount of your securities and may be zero. The volatility of the closing value of the underlying is an important factor affecting these risks. Greater expected volatility of the closing value of the underlying as of the pricing date may result in a higher contingent coupon rate, but would also represent a greater expected likelihood as of the pricing date that the closing value of the underlying on one or more valuation dates will be less than the coupon barrier value, such that you will not receive one or more, or any, contingent coupon payments during the term of the securities and that the final underlying value will be less than the final barrier value, such that you will not be repaid the stated principal amount of your securities at maturity.<br>

The potential contingent coupon payments on the securities are the compensation you receive for assuming the downside risk of the underlying, as well as all the other risks of the securities. That compensation is effectively “at risk” and may, therefore, be less than you currently anticipate. First, the actual yield you realize on the securities could be lower than you anticipate because the coupon is “contingent” and you may not receive a contingent coupon payment on one or more, or any, of the contingent coupon payment dates. Second, the contingent coupon payments are the compensation you receive not only for the downside risk of the underlying, but also for all of the other risks of the securities, including the risk that the securities may be redeemed prior to maturity, interest rate risk and our and Citigroup Inc.’s credit risk. If those other risks increase or are otherwise greater than you currently anticipate, the contingent coupon payments may turn out to be inadequate to compensate you for all the risks of the securities, including the downside risk of the underlying.<br>

Because there is not an active market for traded instruments referencing our outstanding debt obligations, CGMI determines our secondary market rate based on the market price of traded instruments referencing the debt obligations of Citigroup Inc., our parent company and the guarantor of all payments due on the securities, but subject to adjustments that CGMI makes in its sole discretion. As a result, our secondary market rate is not a market-determined measure of our creditworthiness, but rather reflects the market’s perception of our parent company’s creditworthiness as adjusted for discretionary factors such as CGMI’s preferences with respect to purchasing the securities prior to maturity.<br>

United States Federal Tax Considerations<br>
You should read carefully the discussion under “United States Federal Tax Considerations” and “Risk Factors Relating to the Securities” in the accompanying product supplement and “Summary Risk Factors” in this pricing supplement.<br>
Due to the lack of any controlling legal authority, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the securities. In connection with any information reporting requirements we may have in respect of the securities under applicable law, we intend (in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary) to treat the securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated coupon payments that will be treated as gross income to you at the time received or accrued in accordance with your regular method of tax accounting. In the opinion of our counsel, Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP, which is based on current market conditions, this treatment of the securities is reasonable under current law; however, our counsel has advised us that it is unable to conclude affirmatively that this treatment is more likely than not to be upheld, and that alternative treatments are possible.<br>
Assuming this treatment of the securities is respected and subject to the discussion in “United States Federal Tax Considerations” in the accompanying product supplement, the following U.S. federal income tax consequences should result under current law:<br>
Table 54 Row 1 Col 1 | Row Header: ● | Column Header: ●<br>

Table 55 Row 1 Col 2 | Row Header: ● | Column Header: Upon a sale or exchange of a security (including retirement at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in the security. For this purpose, the amount realized does not include any coupon paid on retirement and may not include sale proceeds attributable to an accrued coupon, which may be treated as a coupon payment. Such gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss if you held the security for more than one year.<br>
Upon a sale or exchange of a security (including retirement at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in the security.

Such gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss if you held the security for more than one year.<br>
We do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the treatment of the securities. An alternative characterization of the securities could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of ownership and disposition of the securities, including the timing and character of income recognized. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have requested comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar financial instruments and have indicated that such transactions may be the subject of future regulations or other guidance. Furthermore, members of Congress have proposed legislative changes to the tax treatment of derivative contracts. Any legislation, Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax adviser regarding possible alternative tax treatments of the securities and potential changes in applicable law.<br>
Withholding Tax on Non-U.S. Holders. Because significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain, persons having withholding responsibility in respect of the securities may withhold on any coupon payment paid to Non-U.S. Holders (as defined in the accompanying product supplement), generally at a rate of 30%. To the extent that we have (or an affiliate of ours has) withholding responsibility in respect of the securities, we intend to so withhold. In order to claim an exemption from, or a reduction in, the 30% withholding, you may need to comply with certification requirements to establish that you are not a U.S. person and are eligible for such an exemption or reduction under an applicable tax treaty. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the tax treatment of the securities, including the possibility of obtaining a refund of any amounts withheld and the certification requirement described above.<br>
As discussed under “United States Federal Tax Considerations—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders” in the accompanying product supplement, Section 871(m) of the Code and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Section 871(m)”) generally impose a 30% withholding tax on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to Non-U.S. Holders with respect to certain financial instruments linked to U.S. equities (“U.S. Underlying Equities”) or indices that include U.S. Underlying Equities. Section 871(m) generally applies to instruments that substantially replicate the economic performance of one or more U.S. Underlying Equities, as determined based on tests set forth in the applicable Treasury regulations. However, the regulations, as modified by an IRS notice, exempt financial instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have a “delta” of one. Based on the terms of the securities and representations provided by us, our counsel is of the opinion that the securities should not be treated as transactions that have a “delta” of one within the meaning of the regulations with respect to any U.S. Underlying Equity and, therefore, should not be subject to withholding tax under Section 871(m).<br>
A determination that the securities are not subject to Section 871(m) is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this treatment. Moreover, Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including your other transactions. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the securities.<br>
We will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.<br>
You should read the section entitled “United States Federal Tax Considerations” in the accompanying product supplement. The preceding discussion, when read in combination with that section, constitutes the full opinion of Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP regarding the material U.S. federal tax consequences of owning and disposing of the securities.<br>
You should also consult your tax adviser regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences of an investment in the securities and any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.<br>
Supplemental Plan of Distribution<br>
CGMI, an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. and the underwriter of the sale of the securities, is acting as principal and will receive an underwriting fee of up to $7.00 for each security sold in this offering. The actual underwriting fee will be equal to the selling concession provided to selected dealers, as described in this paragraph. From this underwriting fee, CGMI will pay selected dealers not affiliated with CGMI a variable selling concession of up to $7.00 for each security they sell. For the avoidance of doubt, any fees or selling concessions described in this pricing supplement will not be rebated if we redeem the securities prior to maturity.<br>

See “Plan of Distribution; Conflicts of Interest” in the accompanying product supplement and “Plan of Distribution” in each of the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus for additional information.<br>
Valuation of the Securities<br>
CGMI calculated the estimated value of the securities set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement based on proprietary pricing models. CGMI’s proprietary pricing models generated an estimated value for the securities by estimating the value of a hypothetical package of financial instruments that would replicate the payout on the securities, which consists of a fixed-income bond (the “bond component”) and one or more derivative instruments underlying the economic terms of the securities (the “derivative component”). CGMI calculated the estimated value of the bond component using a discount rate based on our internal funding rate. CGMI calculated the estimated value of the derivative component based on a proprietary derivative-pricing model, which generated a theoretical price for the instruments that constitute the derivative component based on various inputs, including the factors described under “Summary Risk Factors—The value of the securities prior to maturity will fluctuate based on many unpredictable factors” in this pricing supplement, but not including our or Citigroup Inc.’s creditworthiness. These inputs may be market-observable or may be based on assumptions made by CGMI in its discretionary judgment.<br>
For a period of approximately three months following issuance of the securities, the price, if any, at which CGMI would be willing to buy the securities from investors, and the value that will be indicated for the securities on any brokerage account statements prepared by CGMI or its affiliates (which value CGMI may also publish through one or more financial information vendors), will reflect a temporary upward adjustment from the price or value that would otherwise be determined. This temporary upward adjustment represents a portion of the hedging profit expected to be realized by CGMI or its affiliates over the term of the securities. The amount of this temporary upward adjustment will decline to zero on a straight-line basis over the three-month temporary adjustment period. However, CGMI is not obligated to buy the securities from investors at any time.  See “Summary Risk Factors—The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange and you may not be able to sell them prior to maturity.”<br>
