⟦s000034⟧ Hypothetical Examples
⟦s000035⟧ The examples in the first section below illustrate how to determine whether a contingent coupon will be paid following a valuation date.
⟦s000036⟧ The examples in the second section below illustrate how to determine the payment at maturity on the securities, assuming the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity.
⟦s000037⟧ The examples are solely for illustrative purposes, do not show all possible outcomes and are not a prediction of any payment that may be made on the securities.
⟦s000038⟧ The examples below are based on the following hypothetical values and do not reflect the actual initial underlying value, coupon barrier value or final barrier value.
⟦s000039⟧ For the actual initial underlying value, coupon barrier value and final barrier value, see the cover page of this pricing supplement.
⟦s000040⟧ We have used these hypothetical values, rather than the actual values, to simplify the calculations and aid understanding of how the securities work.
⟦s000041⟧ However, you should understand that the actual payments on the securities will be calculated based on the actual initial underlying value, coupon barrier value and final barrier value, and not the hypothetical values indicated below.
⟦s000042⟧ For ease of analysis, figures below have been rounded.
⟦t12r01c01⟧ Hypothetical initial underlying value: | Hypothetical initial underlying value:: Hypothetical initial underlying value:
⟦t12r01c02⟧ Hypothetical initial underlying value: | $100.00: $100.00
⟦t12r02c01⟧ Hypothetical coupon barrier value: | Hypothetical initial underlying value:: Hypothetical coupon barrier value:
⟦t12r02c02⟧ Hypothetical coupon barrier value: | $100.00: $50.00 (50.00% of the hypothetical initial underlying value)
⟦t12r03c01⟧ Hypothetical final barrier value: | Hypothetical initial underlying value:: Hypothetical final barrier value:
⟦t12r03c02⟧ Hypothetical final barrier value: | $100.00: $50.00 (50.00% of the hypothetical initial underlying value)
⟦s000043⟧ Hypothetical Examples of Contingent Coupon Payments Following a Valuation Date
⟦s000044⟧ The three hypothetical examples below illustrate how to determine whether a contingent coupon will be paid following a hypothetical valuation date, assuming that the closing value of the underlying on the hypothetical valuation date is as indicated below.
⟦t13r01c02⟧ Hypothetical closing value of the underlying on hypothetical valuation date: Hypothetical closing value of the underlying on hypothetical valuation date
⟦t13r01c03⟧ Hypothetical payment per $1,000.00 security on related contingent coupon payment date: Hypothetical payment per $1,000.00 security on related contingent coupon payment date
⟦t13r02c01⟧ Example 1: Example 1
⟦t13r02c02⟧ Example 1 | Hypothetical closing value of the underlying on hypothetical valuation date: $85 (greater than coupon barrier value)
⟦t13r02c03⟧ Example 1 | Hypothetical payment per $1,000.00 security on related contingent coupon payment date: $10.00 (contingent coupon is paid)
⟦t13r03c01⟧ Example 2: Example 2
⟦t13r03c02⟧ Example 2 | Hypothetical closing value of the underlying on hypothetical valuation date: $45 (less than coupon barrier value)
⟦t13r03c03⟧ Example 2 | Hypothetical payment per $1,000.00 security on related contingent coupon payment date: $0.00 (no contingent coupon)
⟦t13r04c01⟧ Example 3: Example 3
⟦t13r04c02⟧ Example 3 | Hypothetical closing value of the underlying on hypothetical valuation date: $10 (less than coupon barrier value)
⟦t13r04c03⟧ Example 3 | Hypothetical payment per $1,000.00 security on related contingent coupon payment date: $0.00 (no contingent coupon)
⟦s000045⟧ Example 1: On the hypothetical valuation date, the closing value of the underlying is greater than the coupon barrier value.
⟦s000046⟧ As a result, investors in the securities would receive the contingent coupon payment on the related contingent coupon payment date.
⟦s000047⟧ Example 2: On the hypothetical valuation date, the closing value of the underlying is less than the coupon barrier value.
⟦s000048⟧ As a result, investors would not receive any payment on the related contingent coupon payment date.
⟦s000049⟧ Investors in the securities will not receive a contingent coupon on the contingent coupon payment date following a valuation date if the closing value of the underlying on that valuation date is less than the coupon barrier value.
⟦s000050⟧ Example 3: On the hypothetical valuation date, the closing value of the underlying is less than the coupon barrier value.
⟦s000051⟧ As a result, investors would not receive any payment on the related contingent coupon payment date.

⟦s000052⟧ Hypothetical Examples of the Payment at Maturity on the Securities
⟦s000053⟧ The next three hypothetical examples illustrate the calculation of the payment at maturity on the securities, assuming that the securities have not been earlier redeemed and that the final underlying value is as indicated below.
⟦t16r01c02⟧ Hypothetical final underlying value: Hypothetical final underlying value
⟦t16r01c03⟧ Hypothetical payment at maturity per $1,000.00 security: Hypothetical payment at maturity per $1,000.00 security
⟦t16r02c01⟧ Example 4: Example 4
⟦t16r02c02⟧ Example 4 | Hypothetical final underlying value: $110 (greater than final barrier value)
⟦t16r02c03⟧ Example 4 | Hypothetical payment at maturity per $1,000.00 security: $1,010.00 (contingent coupon is paid)
⟦t16r03c01⟧ Example 5: Example 5
⟦t16r03c02⟧ Example 5 | Hypothetical final underlying value: $30 (less than final barrier value)
⟦t16r03c03⟧ Example 5 | Hypothetical payment at maturity per $1,000.00 security: $300.00
⟦t16r04c01⟧ Example 6: Example 6
⟦t16r04c02⟧ Example 6 | Hypothetical final underlying value: $0 (less than final barrier value)
⟦t16r04c03⟧ Example 6 | Hypothetical payment at maturity per $1,000.00 security: $0.00
⟦s000054⟧ Example 4: The final underlying value is greater than the final barrier value.
⟦s000055⟧ Accordingly, at maturity, you would receive the stated principal amount of the securities plus the contingent coupon payment due at maturity, but you would not participate in the appreciation of the underlying.
⟦s000056⟧ Example 5: The final underlying value is less than the final barrier value.
⟦s000057⟧ Accordingly, at maturity, you would receive a payment per security calculated as follows:
⟦s000058⟧ Payment at maturity = $1,000.
⟦s000059⟧ 00 + ($1,000.
⟦s000060⟧ 00 × the underlying return)
⟦s000061⟧ = $1,000.
⟦s000062⟧ 00 + ($1,000.
⟦s000063⟧ 00 × -70.
⟦s000064⟧ 00%)
⟦s000065⟧ = $1,000.
⟦s000066⟧ 00 + -$700.
⟦s000067⟧ 00
⟦s000068⟧ = $300.
⟦s000069⟧ 00
⟦s000070⟧ In this scenario, because the final underlying value is less than the final barrier value, you would lose a significant portion of your investment in the securities.
⟦s000071⟧ In addition, because the final underlying value is below the coupon barrier value, you would not receive any contingent coupon payment at maturity.
⟦s000072⟧ Example 6: The final underlying value is $0.
⟦s000073⟧ 00.
⟦s000074⟧ Accordingly, at maturity, you would receive a payment per security calculated as follows:
⟦s000075⟧ Payment at maturity = $1,000.
⟦s000076⟧ 00 + ($1,000.
⟦s000077⟧ 00 × the underlying return)
⟦s000078⟧ = $1,000.
⟦s000079⟧ 00 + ($1,000.
⟦s000080⟧ 00 × -100.
⟦s000081⟧ 00%)
⟦s000082⟧ = $1,000.
⟦s000083⟧ 00 + -$1,000.
⟦s000084⟧ 00
⟦s000085⟧ = $0.
⟦s000086⟧ 00
⟦s000087⟧ In this scenario, you would lose your entire investment in the securities at maturity.
⟦s000088⟧ It is possible that the closing value of the underlying will be less than the coupon barrier value on each valuation date and less than the final barrier value on the final valuation date, such that you will not receive any contingent coupon payments over the term of the securities and will receive significantly less than the stated principal amount of your securities, and possibly nothing, at maturity.

⟦s000090⟧ An investment in the securities is significantly riskier than an investment in conventional debt securities.
⟦s000091⟧ The securities are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in our conventional debt securities (guaranteed by Citigroup Inc.), including the risk that we and Citigroup Inc. may default on our obligations under the securities, and are also subject to risks associated with the underlying.
⟦s000092⟧ Accordingly, the securities are suitable only for investors who are capable of understanding the complexities and risks of the securities.
⟦s000093⟧ You should consult your own financial, tax and legal advisors as to the risks of an investment in the securities and the suitability of the securities in light of your particular circumstances.
⟦s000094⟧ The following is a summary of certain key risk factors for investors in the securities.
⟦s000095⟧ You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of risks relating to an investment in the securities contained in the section “Risk Factors Relating to the Securities” beginning on page EA-7 in the accompanying product supplement.
⟦s000096⟧ You should also carefully read the risk factors included in the accompanying prospectus supplement and in the documents incorporated by reference in the accompanying prospectus, including Citigroup Inc.’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which describe risks relating to the business of Citigroup Inc. more generally.

Unlike conventional debt securities, the securities do not provide for the repayment of the stated principal amount at maturity in all circumstances. If the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity, your payment at maturity will depend on the final underlying value. If the final underlying value is less than the final barrier value, you will lose 1% of the stated principal amount of your securities for every 1% by which the underlying has declined from the initial underlying value. There is no minimum payment at maturity on the securities, and you may lose up to all of your investment.: You may lose a significant portion or all of your investment.

⟦s000146⟧ You should read carefully the discussion under “United States Federal Tax Considerations” and “Risk Factors Relating to the Securities” in the accompanying product supplement and “Summary Risk Factors” in this pricing supplement.
⟦s000147⟧ Due to the lack of any controlling legal authority, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the U.

⟦s000149⟧ federal tax consequences of an investment in the securities.
⟦s000150⟧ In connection with any information reporting requirements we may have in respect of the securities under applicable law, we intend (in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary) to treat the securities for U.
⟦s000151⟧ S.
⟦s000152⟧ federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated coupon payments that will be treated as gross income to you at the time received or accrued in accordance with your regular method of tax accounting.
⟦s000153⟧ In the opinion of our counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, which is based on current market conditions, this treatment of the securities is reasonable under current law; however, our counsel has advised us that it is unable to conclude affirmatively that this treatment is more likely than not to be upheld, and that alternative treatments are possible.
⟦s000154⟧ Assuming this treatment of the securities is respected and subject to the discussion in “United States Federal Tax Considerations” in the accompanying product supplement, the following U.

⟦s000156⟧ federal income tax consequences should result under current law:

⟦t55r01c02⟧ ● | Upon a sale or exchange of a security (including retirement at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in the security. For this purpose, the amount realized does not include any coupon paid on retirement and may not include sale proceeds attributable to an accrued coupon, which may be treated as a coupon payment. Such gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss if you held the security for more than one year.: Upon a sale or exchange of a security (including retirement at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in the security. For this purpose, the amount realized does not include any coupon paid on retirement and may not include sale proceeds attributable to an accrued coupon, which may be treated as a coupon payment.

⟦s000157⟧ We do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the treatment of the securities.
⟦s000158⟧ An alternative characterization of the securities could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of ownership and disposition of the securities, including the timing and character of income recognized.

⟦s000163⟧ federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar financial instruments and have indicated that such transactions may be the subject of future regulations or other guidance.
⟦s000164⟧ Furthermore, members of Congress have proposed legislative changes to the tax treatment of derivative contracts.
⟦s000165⟧ Any legislation, Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect.
⟦s000166⟧ You should consult your tax adviser regarding possible alternative tax treatments of the securities and potential changes in applicable law.
⟦s000167⟧ Withholding Tax on Non-U.
⟦s000168⟧ S.
⟦s000169⟧ Holders.

⟦s000177⟧ You should consult your tax adviser regarding the tax treatment of the securities, including the possibility of obtaining a refund of any amounts withheld and the certification requirement described above.
⟦s000178⟧ As discussed under “United States Federal Tax Considerations—Tax Consequences to Non-U.
⟦s000179⟧ S.
⟦s000180⟧ Holders” in the accompanying product supplement, Section 871(m) of the Code and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Section 871(m)”) generally impose a 30% withholding tax on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to Non-U.

⟦s000192⟧ However, the regulations, as modified by an IRS notice, exempt financial instruments issued prior to January 1, 2025 that do not have a “delta” of one.
⟦s000193⟧ Based on the terms of the securities and representations provided by us, our counsel is of the opinion that the securities should not be treated as transactions that have a “delta” of one within the meaning of the regulations with respect to any U.

⟦s000196⟧ A determination that the securities are not subject to Section 871(m) is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this treatment.
⟦s000197⟧ Moreover, Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including your other transactions.

⟦s000217⟧ Valuation of the Securities
⟦s000218⟧ CGMI calculated the estimated value of the securities set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement based on proprietary pricing models.
⟦s000219⟧ CGMI’s proprietary pricing models generated an estimated value for the securities by estimating the value of a hypothetical package of financial instruments that would replicate the payout on the securities, which consists of a fixed-income bond (the “bond component”) and one or more derivative instruments underlying the economic terms of the securities (the “derivative component”).
⟦s000220⟧ CGMI calculated the estimated value of the bond component using a discount rate based on our internal funding rate.
⟦s000221⟧ CGMI calculated the estimated value of the derivative component based on a proprietary derivative-pricing model, which generated a theoretical price for the instruments that constitute the derivative component based on various inputs, including the factors described under “Summary Risk Factors—The value of the securities prior to maturity will fluctuate based on many unpredictable factors” in this pricing supplement, but not including our or Citigroup Inc.’s creditworthiness.
⟦s000222⟧ These inputs may be market-observable or may be based on assumptions made by CGMI in its discretionary judgment.
⟦s000223⟧ For a period of approximately three months following issuance of the securities, the price, if any, at which CGMI would be willing to buy the securities from investors, and the value that will be indicated for the securities on any brokerage account statements prepared by CGMI or its affiliates (which value CGMI may also publish through one or more financial information vendors), will reflect a temporary upward adjustment from the price or value that would otherwise be determined.
⟦s000224⟧ This temporary upward adjustment represents a portion of the hedging profit expected to be realized by CGMI or its affiliates over the term of the securities.
⟦s000225⟧ The amount of this temporary upward adjustment will decline to zero on a straight-line basis over the three-month temporary adjustment period.
⟦s000226⟧ However, CGMI is not obligated to buy the securities from investors at any time.
⟦s000227⟧ See “Summary Risk Factors—The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange and you may not be able to sell them prior to maturity.
