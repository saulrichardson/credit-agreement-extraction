 SCHEDULE 13G 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 Explanatory Note: The Reporting Person initially reported his beneficial ownership of the Issuer's common stock on a Schedule 13G filed with the Commission on October 13, 2021. The Reporting Person was subsequently required to report his beneficial ownership on Schedule 13D under § 240.13d-1(f). The Reporting Person's initial Schedule 13D was filed with the Commission on October 27, 2021. The Reporting Person returned to reporting his beneficial ownership on Schedule 13G pursuant to § 240.13d-1(h), which was filed with the Commission on December 21, 2021. The Reporting Person subsequently returned to reporting his beneficial ownership on Schedule 13D pursuant to § 240.13d-1(f). The Reporting Person is filing this Schedule 13G to (i) amend his most recent Schedule 13D (as amended) pursuant to § 240.13d-2(a) to report a material change in his beneficial ownership which occurred on November 4, 2022, and (ii) report the fact that the Reporting Person ceased to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the Issuer's common stock on November 11, 2022. Because the Reporting Person's obligation to report his beneficial ownership ceased on November 11, 2022, this Schedule 13G presents the Reporting Person's beneficial ownership as of such date.
