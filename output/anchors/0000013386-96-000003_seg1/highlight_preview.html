GENERAL INFORMATION<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The Fund was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland on October 31,<br>
1934. On April 16, 1993, the Fund&#x27;s Articles of Incorporation were amended by<br>
Shareholders to permit the Fund to offer separate series of shares representing<br>
interests in separate portfolios of securities. The shares in any one portfolio<br>
may be offered in separate classes. During the fiscal year ended October 31,<br>
1994, the Fund offered Class A and Class C Shares. On August 31, 1994, the Fund<br>
was reorganized to terminate the separate classes of shares.<br>
The Fund is designed for institutions, pension plans, and individuals as a<br>
convenient means of accumulating an interest in a professionally managed,<br>
diversified portfolio of common and preferred stocks and other equity<br>
securities, bonds, notes, and short-term obligations. A minimum initial<br>
investment of $25,000 over a 90-day period is required.<br>
Shares are currently sold and redeemed at net asset value without a sales charge<br>
imposed by the Fund.<br>
INVESTMENT INFORMATION<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES<br>
The investment objectives of the Fund are to provide relative safety of capital<br>
with the possibility of long-term growth of capital and income. Consideration is<br>
also given to current income. The Fund pursues these investment objectives by<br>
investing in a professionally managed, diversified portfolio of common and<br>
preferred stocks and other equity securities, bonds, notes, and short-term<br>
obligations. While there is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its<br>
investment objectives, it endeavors to do so by following the investment<br>
policies described in this prospectus. The investment objectives and the<br>
policies and limitations described below cannot be changed without approval of<br>
shareholders, unless otherwise noted.<br>
INVESTMENT POLICIES<br>
As a matter of investment policy, which may be changed without shareholder<br>
approval, under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 65% of its<br>
total assets in stocks and bonds.<br>
ACCEPTABLE INVESTMENTS. The Fund invests primarily in a diversified portfolio<br>
of common stocks, bonds, convertible securities, and preferred stocks which<br>
provide characteristics of stability and relative safety, and marketable<br>
securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or<br>
instrumentalities. The Fund anticipates that it will experience characteristics<br>
of stability and relative safety by investing primarily in securities of larger,<br>
well-established companies which have a history of lower volatility in earnings<br>
and price fluctuations.<br>
 COMMON STOCKS. The common stocks in which the Fund invests are selected by<br>
 the Fund&#x27;s investment adviser on the basis of traditional research<br>
 techniques, including assessment of earnings and dividend growth, prospects<br>
 and the risk and volatility of the company&#x27;s industry.<br>
 3<br>
 However, other factors, such as product position, market share, or<br>
 profitability, will also be considered by the Fund&#x27;s investment adviser.<br>
 CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES. Convertible securities are fixed income securities<br>
 which may be exchanged or converted into a predetermined number of the<br>
 issuer&#x27;s underlying common stock at the option of the holder during a<br>
 specified time period. Convertible securities may take the form of<br>
 convertible preferred stock, convertible bonds or debentures, units<br>
 consisting of &quot;usable&quot; bonds and warrants, or a combination of the features<br>
 of several of these securities. The investment characteristics of each<br>
 convertible security vary widely, which allows convertible securities to be<br>
 employed for different investment objectives. In selecting convertible<br>
 securities for the Fund, the Fund&#x27;s investment adviser evaluates the<br>
 investment potential of the underlying security for capital appreciation.<br>
 The convertible securities in which the Fund invests will be rated<br>
 &quot;investment grade&quot; or of comparable quality at the time of purchase. See<br>
 &quot;Investment-Grade Bonds.&quot;<br>
INVESTMENT-GRADE BONDS. The bonds in which the Fund invests will be rated<br>
investment grade (i.e., rated Baa or better by Moody&#x27;s Investors Service, Inc.,<br>
(&quot;Moody&#x27;s&quot;), BBB or better by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s Ratings Group (&quot;S&amp;P&quot;) and Fitch<br>
Investors Service, Inc. (&quot;Fitch&quot;), or, if unrated, deemed to be of comparable<br>
quality) by the Fund&#x27;s investment adviser. Bonds rated BBB by S&amp;P or Fitch or<br>
Baa by Moody&#x27;s have speculative characteristics. Changes in economic conditions<br>
or other circumstances are more likely to lead to weakened capacity to make<br>
principal and interest payments than higher rated bonds. If a security&#x27;s rating<br>
is reduced below the required minimum after the Fund has purchased it, the Fund<br>
is not required to sell the security but may consider doing so. A description of<br>
the rating categories is contained in the Appendix to the Statement of<br>
Additional Information. (The Fund intends to restrict investments to securities<br>
rated investment grade in the current fiscal year. However, the Fund reserves<br>
the right to, in the future, invest in securities rated below investment grade.<br>
The Fund will notify shareholders of such a change in investment policy prior to<br>
its implementation.)<br>
U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. The U.S. government securities in which the Fund<br>
invests are either issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or<br>
instrumentalities. These securities include, but are not limited to:<br>
 - direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury, such as U.S. Treasury bills,<br>
 notes, and bonds; and<br>
 - notes, bonds, and discount notes of U.S. government agencies or<br>
 instrumentalities such as the: Farm Credit System, including the National<br>
 Bank for Cooperatives and Banks for Cooperatives; Federal Home Loan Banks;<br>
 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation; Federal National Mortgage<br>
 Association; Government National Mortgage Association; Export-Import Bank<br>
 of the United States; Commodity Credit Corporation; Federal Financing<br>
 Bank; The Student Loan Marketing Association; National Credit Union<br>
 Administration; and Tennessee Valley Authority.<br>
The prices of fixed income securities fluctuate inversely to the direction of<br>
interest rates.<br>
Some obligations issued or guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities of the<br>
U.S. government, such as Government National Mortgage Association participation<br>
certificates, are backed by the full faith<br>
 4<br>
and credit of the U.S. Treasury. Others for which no assurances can be given<br>
that the U.S. government will provide financial support to the agencies or<br>
instrumentalities, since it is not obligated to do so, are supported by:<br>
 - the issuer&#x27;s right to borrow an amount limited to a specific line of<br>
 credit from the U.S. Treasury;<br>
 - discretionary authority of the U.S. government to purchase certain<br>
 obligations of an agency or instrumentality;<br>
 - or the credit of the agency or instrumentality.<br>
FOREIGN ISSUERS. The Fund may invest in the securities of foreign issuers which<br>
are freely traded on United States securities exchanges or in the<br>
over-the-counter market in the form of depositary receipts. The Fund will limit<br>
its investments in non-ADR foreign obligations to less than 5% of its assets.<br>
Securities of a foreign issuer may present greater risks in the form of<br>
nationalization, confiscation, domestic marketability, or other national or<br>
international restrictions. As a matter of practice, the Fund will not invest in<br>
the securities of a foreign issuer if any such risk appears to the investment<br>
adviser to be substantial.<br>
TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS. In such proportions as, in the judgment of its<br>
investment adviser, prevailing market conditions warrant, the Fund may, for<br>
temporary defensive purposes, invest in:<br>
 - short-term money market instruments;<br>
 - securities issued and/or guaranteed as to payment of principal and<br>
 interest by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities; and<br>
 - repurchase agreements.<br>
 REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. Repurchase agreements are arrangements in which<br>
 banks, broker/ dealers, and other recognized financial institutions sell<br>
 U.S. government securities or other securities to the Fund and agree at the<br>
 time of sale to repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon time and price.<br>
 The Fund or its custodian will take possession of the securities subject to<br>
 repurchase agreements and these securities will be marked to market daily.<br>
 To the extent that the original seller does not repurchase the securities<br>
 from the Fund, the Fund could receive less than the repurchase price on any<br>
 sale of such securities. In the event that such a defaulting seller filed<br>
 for bankruptcy or became insolvent, disposition of such securities by the<br>
 Fund might be delayed pending court action. The Fund believes that under the<br>
 regular procedures normally in effect for custody of the Fund&#x27;s portfolio<br>
 securities subject to repurchase agreements, a court of competent<br>
 jurisdiction would rule in favor of the Fund and allow retention or<br>
 disposition of such securities. The Fund will only enter into repurchase<br>
 agreements with banks and other recognized financial institutions, such as<br>
 broker/dealers, which are found by the Fund&#x27;s adviser to be creditworthy.<br>
RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES. As a matter of investment policy, which may<br>
be changed without shareholder approval, the Fund may invest up to 10% of its<br>
total assets in restricted securities. This restriction is not applicable to<br>
commercial paper issued under Section 4(2) of the<br>
 5<br>
Securities Act of 1933. Restricted securities are any securities in which the<br>
Fund may otherwise invest pursuant to its investment objectives and policies,<br>
but which are subject to restriction on resale under federal securities law. The<br>
Fund will limit investments in illiquid securities, including certain restricted<br>
securities not determined by the Board of Directors (&quot;Directors&quot;) to be liquid,<br>
non-negotiable time deposits, and repurchase agreements providing for settlement<br>
in more than seven days after notice, to 15% of its net assets.<br>
LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. In order to generate additional income, the<br>
Fund may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or a long-term basis to<br>
broker/dealers, banks, or other institutional borrowers of securities. The Fund<br>
will only enter into loan arrangements with broker/dealers, banks, or other<br>
institutions which the investment adviser has determined are creditworthy under<br>
guidelines established by the Fund&#x27;s Directors and will receive collateral in<br>
the form of cash or U.S. government securities equal to at least 100% of the<br>
value of the securities loaned.<br>
There is the risk that when lending portfolio securities, the securities may not<br>
be available to the Fund on a timely basis and the Fund may, therefore, lose the<br>
opportunity to sell the securities at a desirable price. In addition, in the<br>
event that a borrower of securities would file for bankruptcy or become<br>
insolvent, disposition of the securities may be delayed pending court action.<br>
WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS. The Fund may purchase securities<br>
on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis. These transactions are arrangements<br>
in which the Fund purchases securities with payment and delivery scheduled for a<br>
future time. The seller&#x27;s failure to complete these transactions may cause the<br>
Fund to miss a price or yield considered to be advantageous. Settlement dates<br>
may be a month or more after entering into these transactions, and the market<br>
values of the securities purchased may vary from the purchase prices.<br>
Accordingly, the Fund may pay more/less than the market value of the securities<br>
on the settlement date.<br>
The Fund may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if the adviser deems it<br>
appropriate to do so. In addition, the Fund may enter into transactions to sell<br>
its purchase commitments to third parties at current market values and<br>
simultaneously acquire other commitments to purchase similar securities at later<br>
dates. The Fund may realize short-term profits or losses upon the sale of such<br>
commitments.<br>
INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS<br>
The Fund will not:<br>
 - borrow money directly or through reverse repurchase agreements<br>
 (arrangements in which the Fund sells a portfolio instrument for at least<br>
 a percentage of its cash value with an agreement to buy it back on a set<br>
 date) except, under certain circumstances, the Fund may borrow up to<br>
 one-third of the value of its net assets;<br>
 - invest more than 5% of its total assets in securities of one issuer<br>
 (except U.S. government securities);<br>
 - invest in more than 10% of the voting securities of one issuer;<br>
 - invest in more than 10% of any class of securities of one issuer;<br>
 6<br>
 - invest more than 5% of its total assets in securities of issuers that have<br>
 records of less than three years of continuous operations; or<br>
 - invest more than 5% of its assets in warrants, except under certain<br>
 circumstances.<br>
FUND INFORMATION<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND<br>
BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The Fund is managed by a Board of Directors. The Directors<br>
are responsible for managing the Fund&#x27;s business affairs and for exercising all<br>
the Fund&#x27;s powers except those reserved for the shareholders. An Executive<br>
Committee of the Board of Directors handles the Board&#x27;s responsibilities between<br>
meetings of the Board.<br>
INVESTMENT ADVISER. Investment decisions for the Fund are made by Federated<br>
Management, the Fund&#x27;s investment adviser, subject to direction by the<br>
Directors. The adviser continually conducts investment research and supervision<br>
for the Fund and is responsible for the purchase or sale of portfolio<br>
instruments, for which it receives an annual fee from the Fund.<br>
 ADVISORY FEES. The Fund&#x27;s adviser receives an annual investment advisory fee<br>
 equal to 0.55 of 1% of the Fund&#x27;s average daily net assets, plus 4.5% of the<br>
 Fund&#x27;s annual gross income, excluding any capital gains or losses. Gross<br>
 income includes interest accrued, including discount earned on U.S. Treasury<br>
 bills and agency discount notes, interest received or receivable on all<br>
 interest-bearing obligations, and dividend income. The adviser may<br>
 voluntarily choose to waive a portion of its fee or reimburse the Fund for<br>
 certain operating expenses. The adviser can terminate this voluntary waiver<br>
 of its advisory fee at any time at its sole discretion. This does not<br>
 include reimbursement to the Fund of any expenses incurred by shareholders<br>
 who use the transfer agent&#x27;s subaccounting facilities. The adviser has also<br>
 undertaken to reimburse the Fund for operating expenses in excess of<br>
 limitations established by certain states.<br>
Both the Fund and the adviser have adopted strict codes of ethics governing the<br>
conduct of all employees who manage the Fund and its portfolio securities. These<br>
codes recognize that such persons owe a fiduciary duty to the Fund&#x27;s<br>
shareholders and must place the interests of shareholders ahead of the<br>
employees&#x27; own interests. Among other things, the codes: require preclearance<br>
and periodic reporting of personal securities transactions; prohibit personal<br>
transactions in securities being purchased or sold, or being considered for<br>
purchase or sale, by the Fund; prohibit purchasing securities in initial public<br>
offerings; and prohibit taking profits on securities held for less than sixty<br>
days. Violations of the codes are subject to review by the Directors and could<br>
result in severe penalties.<br>

BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
When selecting brokers and dealers to handle the purchase and sale of portfolio<br>
instruments, the adviser looks for prompt execution of the order at a favorable<br>
price. In working with dealers, the adviser will generally use those who are<br>
recognized dealers in specific portfolio instruments, except when a better price<br>
and execution of the order can be obtained elsewhere. In selecting among firms<br>
believed to meet these criteria, the adviser may give consideration to those<br>
firms which have sold or are selling shares of the Fund and other funds<br>
distributed by Federated Securities Corp. The adviser makes decisions on<br>
portfolio transactions and selects brokers and dealers subject to review by the<br>
Directors.<br>
NET ASSET VALUE<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The Fund&#x27;s net asset value per share fluctuates. It is determined by dividing<br>
the sum of the market value of all securities and other assets of the Fund, less<br>
liabilities, by the number of shares outstanding.<br>

MINIMUM INVESTMENT REQUIRED<br>
The minimum initial investment in the Fund is $25,000 plus any non-affiliated<br>
bank or broker&#x27;s fee, if applicable. However, an account may be opened with a<br>
smaller amount as long as the $25,000 minimum is reached within 90 days. An<br>
institutional investor&#x27;s minimum investment will be calculated by combining all<br>
accounts it maintains with the Fund. Accounts established through a non-<br>
affiliated bank or broker may be subject to a smaller minimum investment.<br>
WHAT SHARES COST<br>
Shares are sold at their net asset value next determined after an order is<br>
received. There is no sales charge imposed by the Fund. Investors who purchase<br>
shares through a non-affiliated bank or broker may be charged an additional<br>
service fee by that bank or broker.<br>
The net asset value is determined as of the close of trading (normally 4:00<br>
p.m., Eastern time) on the New York Stock Exchange, Monday through Friday,<br>
except on: (i) days on which there are not sufficient changes in the value of<br>
the Fund&#x27;s portfolio securities that its net asset value might be materially<br>
affected; (ii) days during which no shares are tendered for redemption and no<br>
orders to purchase shares are received; and (iii) the following holidays: New<br>
Year&#x27;s Day, Presidents&#x27; Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br>
Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.<br>
SUBACCOUNTING SERVICES<br>
Institutions are encouraged to open single master accounts. However, certain<br>
institutions may wish to use the transfer agent&#x27;s subaccounting system to<br>
minimize their internal recordkeeping requirements. The transfer agent charges a<br>
fee based on the level of subaccounting services rendered. Institutions holding<br>
shares in a fiduciary, agency, custodial, or similar capacity may charge or pass<br>
through subaccounting fees as part of or in addition to normal trust or agency<br>
account fees. They may also charge fees for other services provided which may be<br>
related to the ownership of shares. This prospectus should, therefore, be read<br>
together with any agreement between the customer and the institution with regard<br>
to the services provided, the fees charged for those services, and any<br>
restrictions and limitations imposed. State securities laws may require certain<br>
financial institutions such as depository institutions to register as dealers.<br>
CERTIFICATES AND CONFIRMATIONS<br>
As transfer agent for the Fund, Federated Services Company maintains a share<br>
account for each shareholder. Share certificates are not issued unless requested<br>
by contacting the transfer agent.<br>
Detailed confirmations of each purchase or redemption are sent to each<br>
shareholder. Quarterly confirmations are sent to report dividends paid during<br>
that quarter.<br>
DIVIDENDS<br>
Dividends are declared and paid quarterly to all shareholders invested in the<br>
Fund on the record date. Unless shareholders request cash payments by writing to<br>
the Fund, dividends are automatically reinvested in additional shares on payment<br>
dates at the ex-dividend date net asset value without a sales charge. All<br>
shareholders on the record date are entitled to the dividend. If shares are<br>
redeemed<br>
 11<br>
or exchanged prior to the record date or purchased after the record date, those<br>
shares are not entitled to that quarter&#x27;s dividend.<br>
CAPITAL GAINS<br>
Capital gains realized by the Fund, if any, will be distributed at least once<br>
every twelve months.<br>
RETIREMENT PLANS<br>
Shares of the Fund can be purchased as an investment for retirement plans or for<br>
IRA accounts. For further details, contact Federated Securities Corp., and<br>
consult a tax adviser.<br>
REDEEMING SHARES<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The Fund redeems shares at their net asset value next determined after the Fund<br>
receives the redemption request. Redemptions will be made on days on which the<br>
Fund computes its net asset value. Redemption requests must be received in<br>
proper form and can be made by telephone request or by written request.<br>
TELEPHONE REDEMPTION<br>
Shareholders may redeem their shares by telephoning the Fund before 4:00 p.m.<br>
(Eastern time). The proceeds will normally be wired the following business day,<br>
but in no event more than seven days, to the shareholder&#x27;s account at a domestic<br>
commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Proceeds from<br>
redemption requests received on holidays when wire transfers are restricted will<br>
be wired the following business day. Questions about telephone redemptions on<br>
days when wire transfers are restricted should be directed to your shareholder<br>
services representative at the telephone number listed on your account<br>
statement. If at any time, the Fund shall determine it necessary to terminate or<br>
modify this method of redemption, shareholders would be promptly notified.<br>
An authorization form permitting the transfer agent or the Fund to accept<br>
telephone requests must first be completed. Authorization forms and information<br>
on this service are available from Federated Securities Corp. Telephone<br>
redemption instructions may be recorded. If reasonable procedures are not<br>
followed by the Fund, it may be liable for losses due to unauthorized or<br>
fraudulent telephone instructions.<br>
In the event of drastic economic or market changes, a shareholder may experience<br>
difficulty in redeeming by telephone. If such a case should occur, another<br>
method of redemption, such as &quot;Written Requests,&quot; should be considered.<br>
WRITTEN REQUESTS<br>
Shares may also be redeemed by sending a written request to the Fund. Call the<br>
Fund for specific instructions before redeeming by letter. The shareholder will<br>
be asked to provide in the request his name, the Fund name, the account number,<br>
and the share or dollar amount requested. If Share certificates have been<br>
issued, they should be sent unendorsed with the written request by registered or<br>
certified mail to: Federated Services Company, P.O. Box 8600, Boston,<br>
Massachusetts 02266-8600.<br>
 12<br>
SIGNATURES. Shareholders requesting a redemption of any amount to be sent to an<br>
address other than that on record with the Fund, or a redemption payable other<br>
than to the shareholder of record must have signatures on written redemption<br>
requests guaranteed by:<br>
 - a trust company or commercial bank whose deposits are insured by the Bank<br>
 Insurance Fund (&quot;BIF&quot;), which is administered by the Federal Deposit<br>
 Insurance Corporation (&quot;FDIC&quot;);<br>
 - a member of the New York, American, Boston, Midwest or Pacific Stock<br>
 Exchanges;<br>
 - a savings bank or savings and loan association whose deposits are insured<br>
 by the Savings Association Insurance Fund (&quot;SAIF&quot;), which is administered<br>
 by the FDIC; or<br>
 - any other &quot;eligible guarantor institution,&quot; as defined in the Securities<br>
 Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.<br>
The Fund does not accept signatures guaranteed by a notary public.<br>
The Fund and its transfer agent have adopted standards for accepting signature<br>
guarantees from the above institutions. The Fund may elect in the future to<br>
limit eligible signature guarantors to institutions that are members of a<br>
signature guarantee program. The Fund and its transfer agent reserve the right<br>
to amend these standards at any time without notice.<br>
Normally, a check for the proceeds is mailed within one business day, but in no<br>
event more than seven days, after receipt of a proper written redemption<br>
request.<br>
ACCOUNTS WITH LOW BALANCES<br>
Due to the high cost of maintaining accounts with low balances, the Fund may<br>
redeem shares in any account and pay the proceeds to the shareholder if the<br>
account balance falls below a required minimum value of $25,000 due to<br>
shareholder redemptions. This requirement does not apply, however, if the<br>
balance falls below $25,000 because of changes in the Fund&#x27;s net asset value.<br>
Before shares are redeemed to close an account, the shareholder is notified in<br>
writing and allowed 30 days to purchase additional shares to meet the minimum<br>
requirement.<br>
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
VOTING RIGHTS<br>
Each share gives the shareholder one vote in Director elections and other<br>
matters submitted to shareholders for vote. All shares of each portfolio or<br>
class in the Fund have equal voting rights, except that only shares of that<br>
particular portfolio or class are entitled to vote in matters affecting that<br>
portfolio or class.<br>
As a Maryland corporation, the Fund is not required to hold annual shareholder<br>
meetings. Shareholder approval will be sought only for certain changes in the<br>
Fund&#x27;s operation and for the election of Directors under certain circumstances.<br>
 13<br>
Directors may be removed by the Directors or by shareholders at a special<br>
meeting. A special meeting of shareholders shall be called by the Directors upon<br>
the written request of shareholders owning at least 25% of the Fund&#x27;s<br>
outstanding shares entitled to vote.<br>
TAX INFORMATION<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
FEDERAL INCOME TAX<br>
The Fund will pay no federal income tax because it expects to meet requirements<br>
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, applicable to regulated investment<br>
companies and to receive the special tax treatment afforded to such companies.<br>
Unless otherwise exempt, shareholders are required to pay federal income tax on<br>
any dividends and other distributions, including capital gains distributions,<br>
received. This applies whether dividends and distributions are received in cash<br>
or as additional shares. Distributions representing long-term capital gains, if<br>
any, will be taxable to shareholders as long-term capital gains no matter how<br>
long the shareholders have held the shares. No federal income tax is due on any<br>
dividends earned in an IRA or qualified retirement plan until distributed.<br>
STATE AND LOCAL TAXES<br>
Fund shares are exempt from personal property taxes imposed by counties,<br>
municipalities and school districts in Pennsylvania.<br>
Shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the status of<br>
their accounts under state and local tax laws.<br>
PERFORMANCE INFORMATION<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
From time to time the Fund advertises the total return and yield for shares.<br>
Total return represents the change, over a specific period of time, in the value<br>
of an investment in shares after reinvesting all income and capital gain<br>
distributions. It is calculated by dividing that change by the initial<br>
investment and is expressed as a percentage.<br>
The yield of the Fund is calculated by dividing the net investment income per<br>
share (as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission) earned by shares<br>
over a thirty-day period by the maximum offering price per share of shares on<br>
the last day of the period. This number is then annualized using semi-annual<br>
compounding. The yield does not necessarily reflect income actually earned by<br>
shares and, therefore, may not correlate to the dividends or other distributions<br>
paid to shareholders.<br>
The Fund is sold without a sales charge or other similar non-recurring charges.<br>
From time to time, advertisements for the Fund may refer to ratings, rankings,<br>
and other information in certain financial publications and/or compare the<br>
Fund&#x27;s performance to certain indices.<br>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<br>
OCTOBER 31, 1995<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
(1) ORGANIZATION<br>
Stock and Bond Fund, Inc. (the &quot;Fund&quot;) is registered under the Investment<br>
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &quot;Act&quot;), as a diversified, open-end,<br>
no-load, management investment company. Previously, the Fund provided two<br>
classes of shares (&quot;Class A Shares&quot; and &quot;Class C Shares&quot;). On May 19, 1994, the<br>
Board of Directors ( the &quot;Directors&quot;) authorized the combination of Class C<br>
Shares with Class A Shares, the termination of all contracts entered into by the<br>
Fund on behalf of Class C shares, and the amendment of the Articles of<br>
Incorporation to reclassify Class A Shares and Class C Shares as unclassified<br>
shares. In connection with these actions, as of August 31, 1994, the &quot;Class C<br>
Shares&quot; were no longer offered.<br>
(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES<br>
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently<br>
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. These<br>
policies are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.<br>
 INVESTMENT VALUATIONS--Short-term securities with remaining maturities of<br>
 sixty days or less at the time of purchase may be valued at amortized cost,<br>
 which approximates fair market value. All other securities are valued at<br>
 prices provided by an independent pricing service.<br>
 REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS--It is the policy of the Fund to require the custodian<br>
 bank to take possession, to have legally segregated in the Federal Reserve<br>
 Book Entry System, or to have segregated within the custodian bank&#x27;s vault,<br>
 all securities held as collateral under repurchase agreement transactions.<br>
 Additionally, procedures have been established by the Fund to monitor, on a<br>
 daily basis, the market value of each repurchase agreement&#x27;s collateral to<br>
 ensure that the value of collateral at least equals the repurchase price to<br>
 be paid under the repurchase agreement transaction.<br>
 The Fund will only enter into repurchase agreements with banks and other<br>
 recognized financial institutions, such as broker/dealers, which are deemed<br>
 by the Fund&#x27;s adviser to be creditworthy pursuant to the guidelines and/or<br>
 standards reviewed or established by the Board of Directors (the<br>
 &quot;Directors&quot;). Risks may arise from the potential inability of counterparties<br>
 to honor the terms of the repurchase agreement. Accordingly, the Fund could<br>
 receive less than the repurchase price on the sale of collateral securities.<br>
 INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS--Dividend income and<br>
 distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest<br>
 income and expenses are accrued daily. Bond premium and discount, if<br>
 applicable, are amortized as required by the Internal Revenue Code, as<br>
 amended (the &quot;Code&quot;).<br>
 27<br>
STOCK AND BOND FUND, INC.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 FEDERAL TAXES--It is the Fund&#x27;s policy to comply with the provisions of the<br>
 Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute to<br>
 shareholders each year substantially all of its income. Accordingly, no<br>
 provisions for federal tax are necessary.<br>
 EQUALIZATION--The Fund follows the accounting practice known as<br>
 equalization, in which a portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of<br>
 redemptions of fund shares equivalent, on a per share basis, equal to the<br>
 amount of undistributed net investment income on the date of the<br>
 transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed net investment income.<br>
 As a result, undistributed net investment income per share is unaffected by<br>
 sales or redemptions of fund shares.<br>
 WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS--The Fund may engage in<br>
 when-issued or delayed delivery transactions. The Fund records when-issued<br>
 securities on the trade date and maintains security positions such that<br>
 sufficient liquid assets will be available to make payment for the<br>
 securities purchased. Securities purchased on a when-issued or delayed<br>
 delivery basis are marked to market daily and begin earning interest on the<br>
 settlement date.<br>
 OTHER--Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date.<br>
(3) CAPITAL STOCK<br>
At October 31, 1995, there were 2,000,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value capital<br>
stock authorized : Transactions in capital stock were as follows:<br>

Table 20 Field S<br>
&lt;c&gt; &lt;c&gt; &lt;c&gt; &lt;c&gt;<br>
(4) INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES<br>
 INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE--Federated Management, the Fund&#x27;s investment<br>
 adviser, (the &quot;Adviser&quot;), receives for its services an annual investment<br>
 advisory fee equal to (a) a maximum of .55 of 1% of the average daily net<br>
 assets of the Fund, and (b) 4.5% of the gross income of the Fund, excluding<br>
 capital gains or losses.<br>
 The Adviser may voluntarily choose to waive any portion of its fee and/or<br>
 reimburse certain operating expenses of the Fund. The Adviser can modify or<br>
 terminate this voluntary waiver and/ or reimbursement at any time at its<br>
 sole discretion.<br>
 ADMINISTRATIVE FEE--Federated Administrative Services (&quot;FAS&quot;), under the<br>
 Administrative Services Agreement, provides the Fund with administrative<br>
 personnel and services. This fee is based on the level of average aggregate<br>
 daily net assets of all funds advised by subsidiaries of Federated Investors<br>
 for the period. The administrative fee received during the period of the<br>
 Administrative Services Agreement shall be at least $125,000 per portfolio<br>
 and $30,000 per each additional class of shares.<br>
 SHAREHOLDER SERVICES FEE--Under the terms of a Shareholder Services<br>
 Agreement with Federated Shareholder Services (&quot;FSS&quot;), the Fund will pay FSS<br>
 up to .25 of 1% of daily average net assets of the Fund for the period. This<br>
 fee is to obtain certain services for shareholders and to maintain<br>
 shareholder accounts. FSS may voluntarily choose to waive a portion of its<br>
 fee. FSS can modify or terminate this voluntary waiver at any time at its<br>
 sole discretion.<br>
 TRANSFER AGENT AND DIVIDEND DISBURSING AGENT FEES AND EXPENSES--Federated<br>
 Services Company (&quot;Fserv&quot;) serves as transfer and dividend disbursing agent<br>
 for the Fund. The fee is based on the size, type, and number of accounts and<br>
 transactions made by shareholders.<br>
 29<br>
STOCK AND BOND FUND, INC.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 PORTFOLIO ACCOUNTING FEES--FServ maintains the Fund&#x27;s accounting records for<br>
 which it receives a fee. The fee is based on the level of the Fund&#x27;s average<br>
 daily net assets for the period, plus out-of-pocket expenses.<br>
 GENERAL--Certain of the Officers and Trustees/Directors of the<br>
 Trust/Corporation are Officers and Directors or Trustees of the above<br>
 companies.<br>
(5) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS<br>
Purchases and sales of investments, excluding short-term securities, for the<br>
period ended October 31, 1995, were as follows:<br>

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS&#x27; REPORT<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of<br>
STOCK AND BOND FUND, INC.:<br>
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including<br>
the portfolio of investments, of Stock and Bond Fund, Inc. as of October 31,<br>
1995, the related statement of operations for the year then ended, and the<br>
statement of changes in net assets for the years October 31, 1995 and 1994, and<br>
the financial highlights (see pages 2 and 15) for the periods presented. These<br>
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the<br>
Fund&#x27;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these<br>
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.<br>
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing<br>
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain<br>
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial<br>
highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a<br>
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial<br>
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of the securities owned as of<br>
October 31, 1995, by correspondence with the custodian and broker. An audit also<br>
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made<br>
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement<br>
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our<br>
opinion.<br>
In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights present<br>
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Stock and Bond Fund,<br>
Inc. as of October 31, 1995, the results of its operations, the changes in its<br>
net assets, and its financial highlights for the respective stated periods in<br>
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.<br>

APPENDIX 38<br>
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUND<br>
Stock and Bond Fund, Inc., (&quot;the Fund&quot;) was incorporated under the laws of<br>
the State of Maryland on October 31, 1934. The name of the Fund was Boston<br>
Foundation Fund Incorporated prior to January 11, 1985 . On April 16, 1993,<br>
the shareholders voted to permit the Fund to offer separate series and<br>
classes of shares. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 1994, the Fund<br>
offered Class A Shares and Class C Shares. On August 31, 1994, a<br>
reorganization of the Fund was completed to eliminate the separate classes of<br>
shares.<br>
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES<br>
The Fund&#x27;s investment objectives are to provide relative safety of capital<br>
with the possibility of long-term growth of capital and income. Consideration<br>
is also given to current income. The investment objectives cannot be changed<br>
without approval of shareholders.<br>
As a matter of investment policy, under normal circumstances, the Fund will<br>
invest at least 65% of its total assets in stocks and bonds.<br>
TYPES OF INVESTMENTS<br>
The Fund invests primarily in a diversified portfolio of common and preferred<br>
stocks and other equity securities, bonds, notes, U.S. government securities,<br>
repurchase agreements, short-term obligations and instruments secured by any<br>
of these obligations.<br>
OBLIGATIONS OF FOREIGN ISSUERS<br>
Obligations of a foreign issuer may present greater risks than investments in<br>
U.S. securities, including higher transaction costs as well as the imposition<br>
of additional taxes by foreign governments. In addition, investments in<br>
foreign issuers may include additional risks associated with less complete<br>
financial information about the issuers, less market liquidity, and political<br>
instability. Future political and economic developments, the possible<br>
imposition of withholding taxes on interest income, the possible seizure or<br>
nationalization of foreign holdings, the possible establishment of exchange<br>
controls, or the adoption of other governmental restrictions might adversely<br>
affect the payment of principal and interest on obligations of foreign<br>
issuers. As a matter of practice, the Fund will not invest in the obligations<br>
of a foreign issuer if any such risk appears to the Fund&#x27;s adviser to be<br>
substantial.<br>
TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS<br>
The Fund may also invest in temporary investments from time to time for<br>
defensive purposes.<br>
 MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS<br>
 The Fund may invest in money market instruments such as:<br>
 oinstruments of domestic and foreign banks and savings and loans if<br>
 they have capital, surplus, and undivided profits of over<br>
 $100,000,000, or if the principal amount of the instrument is<br>
 federally insured; or<br>
 ocommercial paper rated A-1 by Standard and Poor&#x27;s Ratings Group,<br>
 Prime-1 by Moody&#x27;s Investors Service, Inc., or F-1 by Fitch Investors<br>
 Service, Inc.<br>
WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS<br>
The Fund engages in when-issued and delayed delivery transactions only for<br>
the purpose of acquiring portfolio securities consistent with the Fund&#x27;s<br>
objectives and policies, not for investment leverage. These transactions are<br>
made to secure what is considered to be an advantageous price or yield for<br>
the Fund. Settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these<br>
transactions, and the market values of the securities purchased may vary from<br>
the purchase prices. No fees or other expenses, other than normal transaction<br>
costs, are incurred. However, liquid assets of the Fund sufficient to make<br>
payment for the securities to be purchased are segregated on the Fund&#x27;s<br>
records at the trade date. These assets are marked to market daily and are<br>
maintained until the transaction has been settled. As a matter of operating<br>
policy, which may be changed without shareholder approval, the Fund does not<br>
intend to engage in when-issued and delayed delivery transactions to an<br>
extent that would cause the segregation of more than 20% of the total value<br>
of its assets.<br>
LENDING PORTFOLIO SECURITIES<br>
The collateral received when the Fund lends portfolio securities must be<br>
valued daily and, should the market value of the loaned securities increase,<br>
the borrower must furnish additional collateral to the Fund. During the time<br>
portfolio securities are on loan, the borrower pays the Fund any dividends or<br>
interest paid on such securities. Loans are subject to termination at the<br>
option of the Fund or the borrower. The Fund may pay reasonable<br>
administrative and custodial fees in connection with a loan and may pay a<br>
negotiated portion of the interest earned on the cash or equivalent<br>
collateral to the borrower or placing broker. The Fund does not have the<br>
right to vote securities on loan, but would terminate the loan and regain the<br>
right to vote if that were considered important with respect to the<br>
investment.<br>
REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS<br>
The Fund may also enter into reverse repurchase agreements under certain<br>
circumstances. This transaction is similar to borrowing cash. In a reverse<br>
repurchase agreement, the Fund transfers possession of a portfolio instrument<br>
to another person, such as a financial institution, broker, or dealer, in<br>
return for a percentage of the instrument&#x27;s market value in cash, and agrees<br>
that on a stipulated date in the future, the Fund will repurchase the<br>
portfolio instrument by remitting the original consideration plus interest at<br>
an agreed upon rate. The use of reverse repurchase agreements may enable the<br>
Fund to avoid selling portfolio instruments at a time when a sale may be<br>
deemed to be disadvantageous, but the ability to enter into reverse<br>
repurchase agreements does not ensure that the Fund will be able to avoid<br>
selling portfolio instruments at a disadvantageous time.<br>
When effecting reverse repurchase agreements, liquid assets of the Fund, in a<br>
dollar amount sufficient to make payment for the obligations to be purchased,<br>
are segregated at the trade date. These securities are marked to market daily<br>
and are maintained until the transaction is settled.<br>
RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES<br>
The Fund may invest in commercial paper issued in reliance on the exemption<br>
from registration afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.<br>
Section 4(2) commercial paper is restricted as to disposition under federal<br>
securities law and is generally sold to institutional investors, such as the<br>
Fund, who agree that they are purchasing the paper for investment purposes<br>
and not with a view to public distribution. Any resale by the purchaser must<br>
be in an exempt transaction. Section 4(2) commercial paper is normally resold<br>
to other institutional investors like the Fund through or with the assistance<br>
of the issuer or investment dealers who make a market in Section 4(2)<br>
commercial paper, thus providing liquidity.<br>
The ability of the Board of Directors (&quot;Directors&quot;) to determine the<br>
liquidity of certain restricted securities is permitted under a Securities<br>
and Exchange Commission (&quot;SEC&quot;) Staff position set forth in the adopting<br>
release for Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the &quot;Rule&quot;). The Rule<br>
is a non-exclusive safe-harbor for certain secondary market transactions<br>
involving securities subject to restrictions on resale under federal<br>
securities laws. The Rule provides an exemption from registration for resales<br>
of otherwise restricted securities to qualified institutional buyers. The<br>
Rule was expected to further enhance the liquidity of the secondary market<br>
for securities eligible for resale under the Rule. The Fund believes that the<br>
Staff of the SEC has left the question of determining the liquidity of all<br>
restricted securities to the Directors. The Directors may consider the<br>
following criteria in determining the liquidity of certain restricted<br>
securities:<br>
 o the frequency of trades and quotes for the security;<br>
 o the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and the<br>
 number of other potential buyers;<br>
 o dealer undertakings to make a market in the security; and<br>
 o the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades.<br>
PORTFOLIO TURNOVER<br>
The Fund normally holds or disposes of portfolio securities in order to work<br>
toward its investment objectives. Securities held by the Fund are selected<br>
because they are considered to represent real value and will be held or<br>
disposed of accordingly. The Fund&#x27;s investment adviser will not generally<br>
seek profits through short-term trading. The Fund will not attempt to set or<br>
meet a portfolio turnover rate since any turnover would be incidental to<br>
transactions undertaken in an attempt to achieve the Fund&#x27;s investment<br>
objectives. For the fiscal years ended October 31, 1995 and 1994, the<br>
portfolio turnover rates were 68% and 45%, respectively.<br>
INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS<br>
 SELLING SHORT AND BUYING ON MARGIN<br>
 The Fund will not sell any securities short or purchase any securities<br>
 on margin.<br>
 ISSUING SENIOR SECURITIES AND BORROWING MONEY<br>
 The Fund will not issue senior securities, except as permitted by its<br>
 investment objectives and policies, and except that the Fund may enter<br>
 into reverse repurchase agreements and otherwise borrow up to one-third<br>
 of the value of its net assets including the amount borrowed, as a<br>
 temporary, extraordinary or emergency measure or to facilitate<br>
 management of the portfolio by enabling the Fund to meet redemption<br>
 requests when the liquidation of portfolio instruments would be<br>
 inconvenient or disadvantageous. This practice is not for investment<br>
 leverage. The Fund will not purchase any portfolio instruments while any<br>
 borrowings (including reverse repurchase agreements) are outstanding.<br>
 DIVERSIFICATION OF INVESTMENTS<br>
 The Fund will not invest more than 5% of the value of its total assets<br>
 in the securities of any one issuer, except U.S. government securities;<br>
 invest in more than 10% of the voting securities of one issuer; or<br>
 invest in more than 10% of any class of securities of one issuer.<br>
 ACQUIRING SECURITIES<br>
 The Fund will not invest in securities issued by any other investment<br>
 company or investment trust except in regular open-market transactions<br>
 or as part of a plan of merger or consolidation. It will not invest in<br>
 securities of a company for the purpose of exercising control or<br>
 management.<br>
 INVESTING IN NEW ISSUERS<br>
 The Fund will not invest more than 5% of the value of its total assets<br>
 in securities of issuers which have records of less than three years of<br>
 continuous operations.<br>
 SELLING SECURITIES<br>
 The Fund may not sell any security or evidence of interest therein<br>
 unless it is owned by the Fund and available for delivery.<br>
 INVESTING IN COMMODITIES, COMMODITY CONTRACTS, OR REAL ESTATE<br>
 The Fund will not invest in commodities, commodity contracts, or real<br>
 estate.<br>
 UNDERWRITING<br>
 The Fund will not engage in underwriting or agency distribution of<br>
 securities issued by others.<br>
 LENDING CASH OR SECURITIES<br>
 The Fund will not lend any assets except portfolio securities. The<br>
 purchase of corporate or government bonds, debentures, notes or other<br>
 evidences of indebtedness shall not be considered a loan for purposes of<br>
 this limitation.<br>
 CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS<br>
 The Fund will not invest more than 25% of the value of its total assets<br>
 in securities of companies in any one industry.<br>
 INVESTING IN WARRANTS<br>
 The Fund will not invest more than 5% of its assets in warrants,<br>
 including those acquired in units or attached to other securities. To<br>
 comply with certain state restrictions, the Fund will limit its<br>
 investment in such warrants not listed on recognized stock exchanges to<br>
 2% of its total assets. (If state restrictions change, this latter<br>
 restriction may be revised without notice to shareholders.) For purposes<br>
 of this investment restriction, warrants acquired by the Fund in units<br>
 or attached to securities may be deemed to be without value.<br>
The above limitations cannot be changed without shareholder approval. The<br>
following limitations, however, may be changed by the Directors without<br>
shareholder approval. Shareholders will be notified before any material<br>
change in these limitations becomes effective.<br>
 INVESTING IN ISSUERS WHOSE SECURITIES ARE OWNED BY OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS<br>
 OF THE FUND<br>
 The Fund will not purchase or retain the securities of any issuer in<br>
 which the officers and Directors of the Fund or its investment adviser<br>
 own a substantial financial interest.<br>
 INVESTING IN RESTRICTED SECURITIES<br>
 The Fund will not invest more than 10% of its total assets in securities<br>
 subject to restrictions on resale under the Securities Act of 1933,<br>
 except for commercial paper issued under Section 4(2) of the Securities<br>
 Act of 1933 and certain other restricted securities which meet the<br>
 criteria for liquidity as established by the Directors. To comply with<br>
 certain state restrictions, the Fund will limit these transactions to 5%<br>
 of its total assets. (If state restrictions change, this latter<br>
 restriction may be revised without shareholder approval or<br>
 notification.)<br>
 INVESTING IN ILLIQUID SECURITIES<br>
 The Fund will not invest more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid<br>
 securities, including repurchase agreements providing for settlement<br>
 more than seven days after notice and certain restricted securities not<br>
 determined by the Directors to be liquid. To comply with certain state<br>
 restrictions, the Fund will limit these transactions to 10% of its net<br>
 assets. (If state restrictions change, this latter restriction may be<br>
 revised without shareholder approval or notification.)<br>
If a percentage limitation is adhered to at the time of investment, a later<br>
increase or decrease in percentage resulting from any change in value or net<br>
assets will not result in a violation of such restriction.<br>
The Fund did not borrow money or lend portfolio securities in excess of 5% of<br>
the value of its net assets during the last fiscal year and has no present<br>
intent to do so in the coming fiscal year.<br>
In addition, to comply with certain state restrictions, the Fund will not<br>
invest in oil, gas, or other mineral leases, nor will it invest in real<br>
estate limited partnerships. If state restrictions change, these limitations<br>
may be revised without notice to shareholders.<br>

The Corporation&#x27;s Articles of Incorporation provide that the Directors will<br>
not be liable for errors of judgment or mistakes of fact or law. However,<br>
they are not protected against any liability to which they would otherwise be<br>
subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or<br>
reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of their office.<br>
INVESTMENT ADVISORY SERVICES<br>
ADVISER TO THE FUND<br>
The Fund&#x27;s investment adviser is Federated Management. It is a subsidiary of<br>
Federated Investors. All the voting securities of Federated Investors are<br>
owned by a trust, the trustees of which are John F. Donahue, his wife, and<br>
his son, J. Christopher Donahue.<br>
The adviser shall not be liable to the Fund or any shareholder for any losses<br>
that may be sustained in the purchase, holding, or sale of any security or<br>
for anything done or omitted by it, except acts or omissions involving<br>
willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of<br>
the duties imposed upon it by its contract with the Fund.<br>
ADVISORY FEES<br>
For its advisory services, Federated Management receives an annual investment<br>
advisory fee as described in the prospectus. During the fiscal years ended<br>
October 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, the Fund&#x27;s adviser earned $979,379,<br>
$945,715, and $834,842, respectively, of which $215,192, $98,828, and<br>
$222,090, respectively, was voluntarily waived because of undertakings to<br>
limit the Fund&#x27;s expenses. All advisory fees were computed on the same basis<br>
as described in the prospectus.<br>
 STATE EXPENSE LIMITATIONS<br>
 The adviser has undertaken to comply with the expense limitations<br>
 established by certain states for investment companies whose shares are<br>
 registered for sale in those states. If the Fund&#x27;s normal operating<br>
 expenses (including the investment advisory fee, but not including<br>
 brokerage commissions, interest, taxes and extraordinary expenses)<br>
 exceed 2 1/2% per year of the first $30 million of average net assets,<br>
 2% per year of the next $70 million of average net assets, and 1 1/2%<br>
 per year of the remaining average net assets, the adviser will reimburse<br>
 the Fund for its expenses over the limitation.<br>
 If the Fund&#x27;s monthly projected operating expenses exceed this<br>
 limitation, the investment advisory fee paid will be reduced by the<br>
 amount of the excess, subject to an annual adjustment. If the expense<br>
 limitation is exceeded, the amount to be reimbursed by the adviser will<br>
 be limited, in any single fiscal year, by the amount of the investment<br>
 advisory fee. This arrangement is not part of the advisory contract and<br>
 may be amended or rescinded in the future.<br>
BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS<br>
The adviser may select brokers and dealers who offer brokerage and research<br>
services. These services may be furnished directly to the Fund or to the<br>
adviser and may include: advice as to the advisability of investing in<br>
securities; security analysis and reports; economic studies; industry<br>
studies; receipt of quotations for portfolio evaluations; and similar<br>
services. Research services provided by brokers and dealers may be used by<br>
the adviser or its affiliates in advising the Fund and other accounts. To the<br>
extent that receipt of these services may supplant services for which the<br>
adviser or its affiliates might otherwise have paid, it would tend to reduce<br>
their expenses. The adviser and its affiliates exercise reasonable business<br>
judgment in selecting brokers who offer brokerage and research services to<br>
execute securities transactions. They determine in good faith that<br>
commissions charged by such persons are reasonable in relationship to the<br>
value of the brokerage and research services provided.<br>
During the fiscal years ended October 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, the Fund paid<br>
total brokerage commissions of $84,056, $41,256, and $69,262, respectively.<br>
As of October 31, 1995, the Fund owned $952,733 of securities of Travelers<br>
Inc. (Smith Barney) and $931,021 of securities of Dean Witter, two of its<br>
regular brokers that derive more than 15% of gross revenues from securities-<br>
related activities.<br>
Although investment decisions for the Fund are made independently from those<br>
of the other accounts managed by the adviser, investments of the type the<br>
Fund may make may also be made by those other accounts. When the Fund and one<br>
or more other accounts managed by the adviser are prepared to invest in, or<br>
desire to dispose of, the same security, available investments or<br>
opportunities for sales will be allocated in a manner believed by the adviser<br>
to be equitable to each. In some cases, this procedure may adversely affect<br>
the price paid or received by the Fund or the size of the position obtained<br>
or disposed of by the Fund. In other cases, however, it is believed that<br>
coordination and the ability to participate in volume transactions will be to<br>
the benefit of the Fund.<br>
OTHER RELATED SERVICES<br>
Affiliates of the adviser may, from time to time, provide certain electronic<br>
equipment and software to institutional customers in order to facilitate the<br>
purchase of shares of funds offered by Federated Securities Corp.<br>
OTHER SERVICES<br>
FUND ADMINISTRATION<br>
Federated Administrative Services, a subsidiary of Federated Investors,<br>
provides administrative personnel and services to the Fund for a fee as<br>

Administrative Services Inc., also a subsidiary of Federated Investors,<br>
served as the Fund&#x27;s administrator. (For purposes of this Statement of<br>
Additional Information, Federated Administrative Services and Federated<br>
Administrative Services, Inc., may hereinafter collectively be referred to as<br>
the &quot;Administrators&quot;.) For the fiscal year ended October 31, 1995, Federated<br>
Administrative Services earned $125,000. For the fiscal year ended October<br>
31, 1994, the Administrators collectively earned $207,503. For the fiscal<br>

Services.<br>
CUSTODIAN AND PORTOFOLIO RECORDKEEPER<br>
State Street Bank and Trust Company, (&quot;State Street Bank&quot;) Boston,<br>
Massachusetts is custodian for the securities and cash of the Fund. It also<br>
provides certain accounting and recordkeeping services with respect to the<br>
Fund&#x27;s portfolio investments.<br>
TRANSFER AGENT AND DIVIDEND DISBURSING AGENT<br>
As transfer agent, Federated Services Company, maintains all necessary<br>
shareholder records. For its services, the transfer agent receives a fee<br>
based on the size, type, and number of accounts and transactions made by<br>
shareholders.<br>
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS<br>
The independent auditors for the Fund are Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, 2500 One PPG<br>
Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222-5014.<br>
SHAREHOLDER SERVICES AGREEMENT<br>
This arrangement permits the payment of fees to Federated Shareholder<br>
Services and to financial institutions to cause services to be provided to<br>
shareholders by a representative who has knowledge of the shareholder&#x27;s<br>
particular circumstances and goals. These activities and services may<br>
include, but are not limited to: providing office space, equipment, telephone<br>
facilities, and various clerical, supervisory, computer, and other personnel<br>
as necessary or beneficial to establish and maintain shareholder accounts and<br>
records; processing purchase and redemption transactions and automatic<br>
investments of client account cash balances; answering routine client<br>
inquiries; and assisting clients in changing dividend options, account<br>
designations, and addresses. By adopting the Shareholder Services Agreement,<br>
the Directors expect that the Fund will benefit by (1) providing personal<br>
services to the shareholders; (2) investing shareholder assets with a minimum<br>
of delay and administrative detail; (3) enhancing shareholder recordkeeping<br>
systems; and (4) responding promptly to shareholder&#x27;s requests and inquiries<br>
concerning their accounts. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 1995, the<br>
Fund paid shareholder services fees in the amount of $320,244 of which<br>
$178,558 was waived, all of which were paid to financial institutions.<br>
PURCHASING SHARES<br>
Shares are sold at their net asset value without a sales charge on days the<br>
New York Stock Exchange is open for business. The procedure for purchasing<br>
shares is explained in the respective prospectus under &quot;Investing in the<br>
Fund.&quot;<br>
CONVERSION TO FEDERAL FUNDS<br>
The Fund&#x27;s transfer agent acts as the shareholder&#x27;s agent in depositing<br>
checks and converting them to federal funds.<br>
DETERMINING NET ASSET VALUE<br>
Net asset value generally changes each day. The days on which net asset value<br>
is calculated by the Fund are described in the prospectus.<br>
DETERMINING MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES<br>
Market values of the Fund&#x27;s portfolio securities are determined as follows:<br>
 o for equity securities, according to the last sale price on a national<br>
 securities exchange, if available;<br>
 o in the absence of recorded sales for equity securities, according to the<br>
 mean between the last closing bid and asked prices;<br>
 o for bonds and other fixed income securities, at the last sale price on a<br>
 national securities exchange if available, otherwise as determined by an<br>
 independent pricing service;<br>
 o for short-term obligations, according to the mean between the bid and<br>
 asked prices as furnished by an independent pricing service; or<br>
 o for all other securities, at fair value as determined in good faith by<br>
 the Directors.<br>
Prices provided by independent pricing services may be determined without<br>
relying exclusively on quoted prices and may reflect institutional trading in<br>
similar groups of securities, yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of<br>
issue, trading characteristics and other market data.<br>
REDEEMING SHARES<br>
The Fund redeems shares at the next computed net asset value after the Fund<br>
receives the redemption request. Redemption procedures and any fees are<br>
explained in the prospectus under &quot;Redeeming Shares.&quot; Although the Fund&#x27;s<br>
transfer agent does not charge for telephone redemptions, it reserves the<br>
right to charge a fee for the cost of wire-transferred redemptions of less<br>
than $5,000.<br>
REDEMPTION IN KIND<br>
The Fund is obligated to redeem shares solely in cash up to $250,000 or 1% of<br>
the Fund&#x27;s net asset value, whichever is less, for any one shareholder within<br>
a 90-day period. Any redemption beyond this amount will also be in cash<br>
unless the Directors determine that payments should be in kind. In such a<br>
case, the Fund will pay all or a portion of the remainder of the redemption<br>
in portfolio instruments, valued in the same way that net asset value is<br>
determined. The portfolio instruments will be selected in a manner that the<br>
Directors deem fair and equitable. Redemption in kind is not as liquid as a<br>
cash redemption. If redemption is made in kind, shareholders receiving their<br>
securities and selling them before their maturity could receive less than the<br>
redemption value of their securities and could incur transaction costs.<br>
TAX STATUS<br>
THE FUND&#x27;S TAX STATUS<br>
The Fund will pay no federal income tax because it expects to meet the<br>
requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended,<br>
applicable to regulated investment companies and to receive the special tax<br>
treatment afforded to such companies. To qualify for this treatment, the Fund<br>
must, among other requirements:<br>
 o derive at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, and<br>
 gains from the sale of securities;<br>
 o derive less than 30% of its gross income from the sale of securities<br>
 held less than three months;<br>
 o invest in securities within certain statutory limits; and<br>
 o distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its net income earned<br>
 during the year.<br>
SHAREHOLDERS&#x27; TAX STATUS<br>
Shareholders are subject to federal income tax on dividends and capital gains<br>
received as cash or additional shares. The dividends received deduction for<br>
corporations will apply to ordinary income distributions to the extent the<br>
distribution represents amounts that would qualify for the dividends received<br>
deduction to the Fund if the Fund were a regular corporation and to the<br>
extent designated by the Fund as so qualifying. These dividends and any<br>
short-term capital gains are taxable as ordinary income.<br>
 CAPITAL GAINS<br>
 Long-term capital gains distributed to shareholders will be treated as<br>
 long-term capital gains regardless of how long shareholders have held<br>
 the shares.<br>
TOTAL RETURN<br>
The Fund&#x27;s average annual total returns for the one-year, five-year, and ten-<br>
year periods ended October 31, 1995, were 17.99%, 11.99% and 9.90%,<br>
respectively.<br>
Average annual total return is the average compounded rate of return for a<br>
given period that would equate a $1,000 initial investment to the ending<br>
redeemable value of that investment. The ending redeemable value is computed<br>
by multiplying the number of shares owned at the end of the period by the<br>
maximum offering price per share at the end of the period. The number of<br>
shares owned at the end of the period is based on the number of shares<br>
purchased at the beginning of the period with $1,000, adjusted over the<br>
period by any additional shares, assuming the quarterly reinvestment of all<br>
dividends and distributions.<br>
YIELD<br>
The Fund&#x27;s SEC yield for the thirty-day period ended October 31, 1995, was<br>
3.64%.<br>
The yield for the Fund is determined by dividing the net investment income<br>
per share (as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission) earned by<br>
the Fund over a thirty-day period by the maximum offering price per share of<br>
the Fund on the last day of the period. This value is then annualized using<br>
semi-annual compounding. This means that the amount of income generated<br>
during the thirty-day period is assumed to be generated each month over a<br>
twelve-month period and is reinvested every six months. The yield does not<br>
necessarily reflect income actually earned by the Fund because of certain<br>
adjustments required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and,<br>
therefore, may not correlate to the dividends or other distributions paid to<br>
shareholders. To the extent that financial institutions and broker/dealers<br>
charge fees in connection with services provided in conjunction with an<br>
investment in the Fund, performance will be reduced for those shareholders<br>
paying those fees.<br>
PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS<br>
The Fund&#x27;s performance depends upon such variables as:<br>
 o portfolio quality;<br>
 o average portfolio maturity;<br>
 o type of instruments in which the portfolio is invested;<br>
 o changes in interest rates and market value of portfolio securities;<br>
 o changes in the Fund&#x27;s expenses; and<br>
 o various other factors.<br>
The Fund&#x27;s performance fluctuates on a daily basis largely because net<br>
earnings and offering price per share fluctuate daily. Both net earnings and<br>
offering price per share are factors in the computation of yield and total<br>
return.<br>
Investors may use financial publications and/or indices to obtain a more<br>
complete view of the Fund&#x27;s performance. When comparing performance,<br>
investors should consider all relevant factors such as the composition of any<br>
index used, prevailing market conditions, portfolio compositions of other<br>
funds, and methods used to value portfolio securities and compute offering<br>
price. The financial publications and/or indices which the Fund uses in<br>
advertising may include:<br>
 STANDARD &amp; POOR&#x27;S RATING GROUP DAILY STOCK PRICE INDEX OF 500 COMMON<br>
 STOCKS is a composite index of common stocks in industry,<br>
 transportation, and financial and public utility companies, and<br>
 compares total returns of funds whose portfolios are invested<br>
 primarily in common stocks. In addition, the index assumes<br>
 reinvestment of all dividends paid by stocks listed on its index.<br>
 Taxes due on any of these distributions are not included nor are<br>
 brokerage or other fees calculated in these figures.<br>
 SALOMON BROTHERS AAA-AA CORPORATES calculates total returns of<br>
 approximately 775 issues, which include long-term, high-grade domestic<br>
 corporate taxable bonds, rated AAA-AA, with maturities of twelve years<br>
 or more. It also includes companies in industry, public utilities, and<br>
 finance.<br>
 LIPPER ANALYTICAL SERVICES, INC., ranks funds in various categories by<br>
 making comparative calculations using total return. Total return<br>
 assumes the reinvestment of all capital gains distributions and income<br>
 dividends and takes into account any change in net asset value over a<br>
 specific period of time. From time to time, the Fund will quote its<br>
 Lipper ranking in advertising and sales literature.<br>
 LEHMAN BROTHERS GOVERNMENT/CORPORATE (TOTAL) is comprised of<br>
 approximately 5,000 issues which include non-convertible bonds publicly<br>
 issued by the U.S. government or its agencies; corporate bonds<br>
 guaranteed by the U.S. government and quasi-federal corporations; and<br>
 publicly issued, fixed rate, non-convertible domestic bonds of<br>
 companies in industry, public utilities, and finance. The average<br>
 maturity of these bonds approximates nine years. Tracked by Lehman<br>
 Brothers, Inc., the index calculates total returns for one-month,<br>
 three-month, twelve-month, and ten-year periods and year-to-date.<br>
 S&amp;P 500/LEHMAN BROTHERS GOVERNMENT/CORPORATE (WEIGHTED INDEX) AND THE<br>
 S&amp;P 500/ LEHMAN BROTHERS GOVERNMENT (WEIGHTED INDEX) combine the<br>
 components of a stock-oriented index and a bond-oriented index to<br>
 obtain results which can be compared to the performance of a managed<br>
 fund. The indices&#x27; total returns will be assigned various weights<br>
 depending upon the Fund&#x27;s current asset allocation.<br>
 MORNINGSTAR, INC., an independent rating service, is the publisher of<br>
 the bi-weekly Mutual Fund Values. Mutual Fund Values rates more than<br>
 1,000 NASDAQ-listed mutual funds of all types, according to their<br>
 risk-adjusted returns. The maximum rating is five stars, and ratings<br>
 are effective for two weeks.<br>
Investors may also consult the fund evaluation consulting universe listed<br>
below. Consulting universes may be composed of pension, profit-sharing,<br>
commingled, endowment/foundation and mutual funds.<br>
 SEI BALANCED UNIVERSE is composed of 916 portfolios managed by 390<br>
 managers representing $86 billion in assets. To be included in the<br>
 universe, a portfolio must contain a 5% minimum commitment in both<br>
 equity and fixed income securities.<br>
Advertisements and other sales literature for the Fund may quote total<br>
returns which are calculated on non-standardized base periods. These total<br>
returns also represent the historic change in the value of an investment in<br>
the Fund based on quarterly reinvestment of dividends over a specified period<br>
of time.<br>
DURATION<br>
Duration is a commonly used measure of the potential volatility in the price<br>
of a bond, other fixed income security, or in a portfolio of fixed income<br>
securities, prior to maturity. Volatility is the magnitude of the change in<br>
the price of a bond relative to a given change in the market rate of<br>
interest. A bond&#x27;s price volatility depends on three primary variables: the<br>
bond&#x27;s coupon rate; maturity date; and the level of market yields of similar<br>
fixed-income securities. Generally, bonds with lower coupons or longer<br>
maturities will be more volatile than bonds with higher coupons or shorter<br>
maturities. Duration combines these variables into a single measure.<br>
Duration is calculated by dividing the sum of the time-weighted values of the<br>
cash flows of a bond or bonds, including interest and principal payments, by<br>
the sum of the present values of the cash flows.<br>
When the Fund invests in mortgage pass-through securities, its duration will<br>
be calculated in a manner which requires assumptions to be made regarding<br>
future capital prepayments. A more complete description of this calculation<br>
is available upon request from the Fund.<br>

APPENDIX<br>
STANDARD AND POOR&#x27;S RATINGS GROUP CORPORATE BOND RATINGS<br>
AAA--Debt rated AAA has the highest rating assigned by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s<br>
Ratings Group (&quot;S&amp;P&quot;). Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is<br>
extremely strong.<br>
AA--Debt rated AA has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay<br>
principal and differs from the higher rated issues only in small degree.<br>
A--Debt rated A has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal<br>
although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in<br>
circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higher rated categories.<br>
BBB--Debt rated BBB is regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay<br>
interest and repay principal. Whereas it normally exhibits adequate<br>
protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances<br>
are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay<br>
principal for debt in this category than in higher rated categories.<br>
NR--NR indicates that no public rating has been requested, that there is<br>
insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&amp;P does not rate<br>
a particular type of obligation as a matter of policy.<br>
MOODY&#x27;S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC., CORPORATE BOND RATINGS<br>
AAA--Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality. They<br>
carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as<br>
&quot;gilt edged.&quot; Interest payments are protected by a large or by an<br>
exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. While the various<br>
protective elements are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized<br>
are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues.<br>
AA--Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all<br>
standards. Together with the Aaa group, they comprise what are generally<br>
known as high-grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because<br>
margins of protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuation<br>
of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other<br>
elements present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than<br>
in Aaa securities.<br>
A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and<br>
are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors giving<br>
security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may<br>
be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the<br>
future.<br>
BAA--Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations,<br>
(i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured). Interest<br>
payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain<br>
protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable<br>
over any great length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment<br>
characteristics and, in fact, have speculative characteristics as well.<br>
NR--Not rated by Moody&#x27;s.<br>
Moody&#x27;s applies numerical modifiers, 1, 2, and 3 in each generic rating<br>
classification from Aa through B in corporate bond rating system. The<br>
modifier 1 indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of its generic<br>
ranking category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the<br>
modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic<br>
rating category.<br>
FITCH INVESTORS SERVICE, INC., LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS<br>
AAA--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit<br>
quality. The obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest and<br>
repay principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable<br>
events.<br>
AA--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality.<br>
The obligor&#x27;s ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong,<br>
although not quite as strong as bonds rated AAA. Because bonds rated in the<br>
AAA and AA categories are not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable future<br>
developments, short-term debt of these issuers is generally rated F-1+.<br>
A--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality. The<br>
obligor&#x27;s ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be<br>
strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions<br>
and circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.<br>
BBB--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit<br>
quality. The obligor&#x27;s ability to pay interest and repay principal is<br>
considered to be adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and<br>
circumstances, however, are more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds<br>
and, therefore, impair timely payment. The likelihood that the ratings of<br>
these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than bonds with higher<br>
ratings.<br>
NR--NR indicates that Fitch does not rate the specific issue.<br>
PLUS (+) OR MINUS (-): Plus and minus signs are used with a rating symbol to<br>
indicate the relative position of a credit within the rating category. Plus<br>
and minus signs, however, are not used in the AAA category.<br>
STANDARD AND POOR&#x27;S RATINGS GROUP COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS<br>
A-1--This designation indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely<br>
payment is strong. Those issues determined to possess extremely strong safety<br>
characteristics are denoted with a plus (+) sign designation.<br>
A-2--Capacity for timely payment on issues with this designation is<br>
satisfactory. However, the relative degree of safety is not as high as for<br>
issues designated A-1.<br>
MOODY&#x27;S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC., COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS<br>
PRIME-1- Issuers rated Prime-1 (or related supporting institutions) have a<br>
superior capacity for repayment of short-term promissory obligations. Prime-<br>
1 repayment capacity will normally be evidenced by the following<br>
characteristics:<br>
 o Leading market positions in well established industries.<br>
 o High rates of return on funds employed.<br>
 o Conservative capitalization structure with moderate reliance on debt and<br>
 ample asset protection.<br>
 o Broad margins in earning coverage of fixed financial charges and high<br>
 internal cash generation.<br>
 o Well-established access to a range of financial markets and assured<br>
 sources of alternate liquidity.<br>
PRIME-2- Issuers rated Prime-2 (or related supporting institutions) have a<br>
strong capacity for repayment of short- term promissory obligations. This<br>
will normally be evidenced by many of the characteristics cited above, but to<br>
a lesser degree. Earnings trends and coverage ratios, while sound, will be<br>
more subject to variation. Capitalization characteristics, while still<br>
appropriate, may be more affected by external conditions. Ample alternate<br>
liquidity is maintained.<br>
FITCH INVESTORS SERVICE, INC., SHORT-TERM RATINGS<br>
F-1+ --(Exceptionally Strong Credit Quality). Issues assigned this rating are<br>
regarded as having the strongest degree of assurance for timely payment.<br>
F-1--(Very Strong Credit Quality). Issues assigned this rating reflect an<br>
assurance of timely payment only slightly less in degree than issues rated F-<br>
1+.<br>
F-2--(Good Credit Quality). Issues carrying this rating have a satisfactory<br>
degree of assurance for timely payment, but the margin of safety is not as<br>
great as the F-1+ and F-1 categories.<br>

 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 1995<br>
 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS<br>
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 The fiscal year ended October 31, 1995 was very positive for high<br>
 quality fixed income securities. For much of calendar year 1995, the<br>
 majority of economic releases seemed to point toward a slowing economy<br>
 coupled with consistent declines in inflation. As a result, after peaking<br>
 in yield levels during November 1994, all maturity points experienced<br>
 significant yield declines for the remainder of the fiscal year. As<br>
 reference points, the 2-year, 5-year, and 30-year Treasury securities<br>
Cusip 86101A104<br>
8012905B (12/95)<br>
 decreased in yield for the entire fiscal year by 130, 177, and 173 basis<br>
 points, respectively.<br>
 Starting early in the fiscal year, fund management significantly<br>
 increased the allocation to investment grade corporate securities while<br>
 decreasing the Treasury allocation and relatively maintaining the mortgage<br>
 allocation. Specifically, corporates were increased from approximately 5%<br>
 to 25%-30%. In retrospect, the corporate emphasis served to enhance overall<br>
 returns as the yield spread advantage over Treasuries tightened<br>
 (outperformed) for most of the fiscal year. With the economy exhibiting<br>
 slower growth characteristics which could lead to a weaker corporate<br>
 environment, the fund is reversing its allocation away from corporate<br>
 securities and back toward government securities.<br>
 From a duration perspective, the bond portion moved to a slightly<br>
 defensive position in late May 1995, decreasing duration from approximately<br>
 5.0 years to 4.25 years. No significant duration changes have occurred<br>
 since that time nor are any anticipated in the near future.<br>
 In the fiscal year ended October 31, 1995, the U.S. stock market<br>
 advanced strongly, with the S&amp;P 500 Index recording a total return of<br>
 26.4%. This compares to a modest 3.9% for the 12 months ended October 31,<br>
 1994. Total return for Stock and Bond Fund, Inc. (the &quot;Fund&quot;) in the latest<br>
 fiscal year was 17.99% vs. 19.8% for the average Lipper Balanced Fund<br>
 (Lipper Analytical Services, Inc.). This ranked the Fund 105 out of 216<br>
 Lipper Balanced Funds, or in the 48th percentile for the year. The Fund&#x27;s<br>
 five year ranking as of October 31, 1995 was 47 out of 60 funds. The Fund&#x27;s<br>
 ten year ranking as of September 30, 1995 was 29 out of 30 funds.<br>
 Recent market strength was concentrated in large capitalization stocks<br>
 which substantially influence results of the S&amp;P 500 Index. In contrast,<br>
 the Russell 2000, a popular benchmark for small cap stocks had a total<br>
 return of only 16.2% for the year ended October 31, 1995.<br>
 Market strength over the past year has been importantly related to<br>
 declining interest rates and continuing strong growth in corporate profits.<br>
 The 30 year U.S. Treasury bond yield has declined from 8.1% to roughly<br>
 6.2%. Aggregate corporate earnings for U.S. companies have shown 12-15%<br>
 gains in the past three quarters vs. 1994. The consensus forecast at this<br>
 time is for a rather benign inflation and interest rate environment and<br>
 moderate real growth in U.S. economic activity, perhaps at the 2.0-2.5%<br>
 level (annual rate). This backdrop and the substantial rise in the stock<br>
 market over the past year dictates increased selectivity in stock selection<br>
 at this time.<br>
 The best performing sector over the past year has been Technology,<br>
 although many stocks in this area have experienced corrections over the<br>
 past few months. We reduced our weighting in Technology a few months ago,<br>
 but remain modestly overweight relative to the S&amp;P 500, given the excellent<br>
 long-term outlook. The Finance sector has also performed well over the past<br>
 year and the Fund continues to have a significant exposure to this group.<br>
 As part of our portfolio management process in determining relative<br>
 sector weightings, we also attempt to identify underlying investment<br>
 themes. Some companies fit more than one theme. At this time, the major<br>
 themes in the Fund&#x27;s portfolio are as follows:<br>
 (1) Beneficiaries of corporate &quot;restructuring&quot; such as AT&amp;T, ITT and<br>
 CIGNA.<br>
 (2) Industry consolidation; Lockheed Martin in the aerospace/defense<br>
 industry, and First Interstate in banking are examples.<br>
 (3) Companies which generate significant excess cash flow such as<br>
 Philip Morris and FMC.<br>
 (4) Dominant companies with superior management; General Electric,<br>
 Citicorp and Philip Morris fit this description.<br>
 (5) The Technology revolution; major &quot;plays&quot; include Hewlett Packard,<br>
 IBM, and General Motors, Class &quot;E&quot; (EDS).<br>
 While some market observers express concern with overvaluation in the<br>
 current market, we believe good long-term values can be identified by our<br>
 disciplined process and careful fundamental research. An important part of<br>
 our process is our emphasis on controlling risk through diversification and<br>
 attention to valuation of individual stocks.<br>
