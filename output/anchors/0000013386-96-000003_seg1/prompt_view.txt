⟦s000036⟧ On April 16, 1993, the Fund's Articles of Incorporation were amended by Shareholders to permit the Fund to offer separate series of shares representing interests in separate portfolios of securities.
⟦s000037⟧ The shares in any one portfolio may be offered in separate classes.
⟦s000038⟧ During the fiscal year ended October 31, 1994, the Fund offered Class A and Class C Shares.
⟦s000039⟧ On August 31, 1994, the Fund was reorganized to terminate the separate classes of shares.
⟦s000040⟧ The Fund is designed for institutions, pension plans, and individuals as a convenient means of accumulating an interest in a professionally managed, diversified portfolio of common and preferred stocks and other equity securities, bonds, notes, and short-term obligations.
⟦s000041⟧ A minimum initial investment of $25,000 over a 90-day period is required.
⟦s000042⟧ Shares are currently sold and redeemed at net asset value without a sales charge imposed by the Fund.
⟦s000043⟧ INVESTMENT INFORMATION -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES The investment objectives of the Fund are to provide relative safety of capital with the possibility of long-term growth of capital and income.
⟦s000044⟧ Consideration is also given to current income.
⟦s000045⟧ The Fund pursues these investment objectives by investing in a professionally managed, diversified portfolio of common and preferred stocks and other equity securities, bonds, notes, and short-term obligations.
⟦s000046⟧ While there is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives, it endeavors to do so by following the investment policies described in this prospectus.
⟦s000047⟧ The investment objectives and the policies and limitations described below cannot be changed without approval of shareholders, unless otherwise noted.
⟦s000048⟧ INVESTMENT POLICIES As a matter of investment policy, which may be changed without shareholder approval, under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 65% of its total assets in stocks and bonds.
⟦s000049⟧ ACCEPTABLE INVESTMENTS.
⟦s000050⟧ The Fund invests primarily in a diversified portfolio of common stocks, bonds, convertible securities, and preferred stocks which provide characteristics of stability and relative safety, and marketable securities issued or guaranteed by the U.
⟦s000051⟧ S.
⟦s000052⟧ government, its agencies or instrumentalities.
⟦s000053⟧ The Fund anticipates that it will experience characteristics of stability and relative safety by investing primarily in securities of larger, well-established companies which have a history of lower volatility in earnings and price fluctuations.
⟦s000054⟧ COMMON STOCKS.
⟦s000055⟧ The common stocks in which the Fund invests are selected by the Fund's investment adviser on the basis of traditional research techniques, including assessment of earnings and dividend growth, prospects and the risk and volatility of the company's industry.
⟦s000056⟧ 3 However, other factors, such as product position, market share, or profitability, will also be considered by the Fund's investment adviser.
⟦s000057⟧ CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES.
⟦s000058⟧ Convertible securities are fixed income securities which may be exchanged or converted into a predetermined number of the issuer's underlying common stock at the option of the holder during a specified time period.
⟦s000059⟧ Convertible securities may take the form of convertible preferred stock, convertible bonds or debentures, units consisting of "usable" bonds and warrants, or a combination of the features of several of these securities.
⟦s000060⟧ The investment characteristics of each convertible security vary widely, which allows convertible securities to be employed for different investment objectives.
⟦s000061⟧ In selecting convertible securities for the Fund, the Fund's investment adviser evaluates the investment potential of the underlying security for capital appreciation.
⟦s000062⟧ The convertible securities in which the Fund invests will be rated "investment grade" or of comparable quality at the time of purchase.
⟦s000063⟧ See "Investment-Grade Bonds.
⟦s000064⟧ " INVESTMENT-GRADE BONDS.
⟦s000065⟧ The bonds in which the Fund invests will be rated investment grade (i.e.
⟦s000066⟧ , rated Baa or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., ("Moody's"), BBB or better by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P") and Fitch Investors Service, Inc. ("Fitch"), or, if unrated, deemed to be of comparable quality) by the Fund's investment adviser.
⟦s000067⟧ Bonds rated BBB by S&P or Fitch or Baa by Moody's have speculative characteristics.
⟦s000068⟧ Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances are more likely to lead to weakened capacity to make principal and interest payments than higher rated bonds.
⟦s000069⟧ If a security's rating is reduced below the required minimum after the Fund has purchased it, the Fund is not required to sell the security but may consider doing so.
⟦s000070⟧ A description of the rating categories is contained in the Appendix to the Statement of Additional Information.
⟦s000071⟧ (The Fund intends to restrict investments to securities rated investment grade in the current fiscal year.
⟦s000072⟧ However, the Fund reserves the right to, in the future, invest in securities rated below investment grade.
⟦s000073⟧ The Fund will notify shareholders of such a change in investment policy prior to its implementation.

⟦s000089⟧ The prices of fixed income securities fluctuate inversely to the direction of interest rates.
⟦s000090⟧ Some obligations issued or guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities of the U.

⟦s000097⟧ government will provide financial support to the agencies or instrumentalities, since it is not obligated to do so, are supported by: - the issuer's right to borrow an amount limited to a specific line of credit from the U.

⟦s000100⟧ S.
⟦s000101⟧ government to purchase certain obligations of an agency or instrumentality; - or the credit of the agency or instrumentality.
⟦s000102⟧ FOREIGN ISSUERS.
⟦s000103⟧ The Fund may invest in the securities of foreign issuers which are freely traded on United States securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter market in the form of depositary receipts.
⟦s000104⟧ The Fund will limit its investments in non-ADR foreign obligations to less than 5% of its assets.
⟦s000105⟧ Securities of a foreign issuer may present greater risks in the form of nationalization, confiscation, domestic marketability, or other national or international restrictions.
⟦s000106⟧ As a matter of practice, the Fund will not invest in the securities of a foreign issuer if any such risk appears to the investment adviser to be substantial.
⟦s000107⟧ TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS.
⟦s000108⟧ In such proportions as, in the judgment of its investment adviser, prevailing market conditions warrant, the Fund may, for temporary defensive purposes, invest in: - short-term money market instruments; - securities issued and/or guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the U.
⟦s000109⟧ S.
⟦s000110⟧ government, its agencies or instrumentalities; and - repurchase agreements.
⟦s000111⟧ REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.
⟦s000112⟧ Repurchase agreements are arrangements in which banks, broker/ dealers, and other recognized financial institutions sell U.
⟦s000113⟧ S.
⟦s000114⟧ government securities or other securities to the Fund and agree at the time of sale to repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon time and price.
⟦s000115⟧ The Fund or its custodian will take possession of the securities subject to repurchase agreements and these securities will be marked to market daily.
⟦s000116⟧ To the extent that the original seller does not repurchase the securities from the Fund, the Fund could receive less than the repurchase price on any sale of such securities.
⟦s000117⟧ In the event that such a defaulting seller filed for bankruptcy or became insolvent, disposition of such securities by the Fund might be delayed pending court action.
⟦s000118⟧ The Fund believes that under the regular procedures normally in effect for custody of the Fund's portfolio securities subject to repurchase agreements, a court of competent jurisdiction would rule in favor of the Fund and allow retention or disposition of such securities.
⟦s000119⟧ The Fund will only enter into repurchase agreements with banks and other recognized financial institutions, such as broker/dealers, which are found by the Fund's adviser to be creditworthy.
⟦s000120⟧ RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES.
⟦s000121⟧ As a matter of investment policy, which may be changed without shareholder approval, the Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in restricted securities.
⟦s000122⟧ This restriction is not applicable to commercial paper issued under Section 4(2) of the 5 Securities Act of 1933.
⟦s000123⟧ Restricted securities are any securities in which the Fund may otherwise invest pursuant to its investment objectives and policies, but which are subject to restriction on resale under federal securities law.
⟦s000124⟧ The Fund will limit investments in illiquid securities, including certain restricted securities not determined by the Board of Directors ("Directors") to be liquid, non-negotiable time deposits, and repurchase agreements providing for settlement in more than seven days after notice, to 15% of its net assets.
⟦s000125⟧ LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES.
⟦s000126⟧ In order to generate additional income, the Fund may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or a long-term basis to broker/dealers, banks, or other institutional borrowers of securities.
⟦s000127⟧ The Fund will only enter into loan arrangements with broker/dealers, banks, or other institutions which the investment adviser has determined are creditworthy under guidelines established by the Fund's Directors and will receive collateral in the form of cash or U.
⟦s000128⟧ S.
⟦s000129⟧ government securities equal to at least 100% of the value of the securities loaned.
⟦s000130⟧ There is the risk that when lending portfolio securities, the securities may not be available to the Fund on a timely basis and the Fund may, therefore, lose the opportunity to sell the securities at a desirable price.
⟦s000131⟧ In addition, in the event that a borrower of securities would file for bankruptcy or become insolvent, disposition of the securities may be delayed pending court action.
⟦s000132⟧ WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS.
⟦s000133⟧ The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis.
⟦s000134⟧ These transactions are arrangements in which the Fund purchases securities with payment and delivery scheduled for a future time.
⟦s000135⟧ The seller's failure to complete these transactions may cause the Fund to miss a price or yield considered to be advantageous.
⟦s000136⟧ Settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these transactions, and the market values of the securities purchased may vary from the purchase prices.
⟦s000137⟧ Accordingly, the Fund may pay more/less than the market value of the securities on the settlement date.
⟦s000138⟧ The Fund may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if the adviser deems it appropriate to do so.
⟦s000139⟧ In addition, the Fund may enter into transactions to sell its purchase commitments to third parties at current market values and simultaneously acquire other commitments to purchase similar securities at later dates.
⟦s000140⟧ The Fund may realize short-term profits or losses upon the sale of such commitments.
⟦s000141⟧ INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS The Fund will not: - borrow money directly or through reverse repurchase agreements (arrangements in which the Fund sells a portfolio instrument for at least a percentage of its cash value with an agreement to buy it back on a set date) except, under certain circumstances, the Fund may borrow up to one-third of the value of its net assets; - invest more than 5% of its total assets in securities of one issuer (except U.
⟦s000142⟧ S.
⟦s000143⟧ government securities); - invest in more than 10% of the voting securities of one issuer; - invest in more than 10% of any class of securities of one issuer; 6 - invest more than 5% of its total assets in securities of issuers that have records of less than three years of continuous operations; or - invest more than 5% of its assets in warrants, except under certain circumstances.

⟦s000237⟧ In selecting among firms believed to meet these criteria, the adviser may give consideration to those firms which have sold or are selling shares of the Fund and other funds distributed by Federated Securities Corp. The adviser makes decisions on portfolio transactions and selects brokers and dealers subject to review by the Directors.
⟦s000238⟧ NET ASSET VALUE -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Fund's net asset value per share fluctuates.
⟦s000239⟧ It is determined by dividing the sum of the market value of all securities and other assets of the Fund, less liabilities, by the number of shares outstanding.

⟦s000259⟧ However, an account may be opened with a smaller amount as long as the $25,000 minimum is reached within 90 days.
⟦s000260⟧ An institutional investor's minimum investment will be calculated by combining all accounts it maintains with the Fund.
⟦s000261⟧ Accounts established through a non- affiliated bank or broker may be subject to a smaller minimum investment.
⟦s000262⟧ WHAT SHARES COST Shares are sold at their net asset value next determined after an order is received.

⟦s000264⟧ Investors who purchase shares through a non-affiliated bank or broker may be charged an additional service fee by that bank or broker.

⟦s000267⟧ SUBACCOUNTING SERVICES Institutions are encouraged to open single master accounts.
⟦s000268⟧ However, certain institutions may wish to use the transfer agent's subaccounting system to minimize their internal recordkeeping requirements.
⟦s000269⟧ The transfer agent charges a fee based on the level of subaccounting services rendered.
⟦s000270⟧ Institutions holding shares in a fiduciary, agency, custodial, or similar capacity may charge or pass through subaccounting fees as part of or in addition to normal trust or agency account fees.
⟦s000271⟧ They may also charge fees for other services provided which may be related to the ownership of shares.
⟦s000272⟧ This prospectus should, therefore, be read together with any agreement between the customer and the institution with regard to the services provided, the fees charged for those services, and any restrictions and limitations imposed.
⟦s000273⟧ State securities laws may require certain financial institutions such as depository institutions to register as dealers.

⟦s000277⟧ Quarterly confirmations are sent to report dividends paid during that quarter.

⟦s000280⟧ All shareholders on the record date are entitled to the dividend.
⟦s000281⟧ If shares are redeemed 11 or exchanged prior to the record date or purchased after the record date, those shares are not entitled to that quarter's dividend.

⟦s000285⟧ REDEEMING SHARES -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Fund redeems shares at their net asset value next determined after the Fund receives the redemption request.

⟦s000288⟧ TELEPHONE REDEMPTION Shareholders may redeem their shares by telephoning the Fund before 4:00 p.m.

⟦s000290⟧ The proceeds will normally be wired the following business day, but in no event more than seven days, to the shareholder's account at a domestic commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System.
⟦s000291⟧ Proceeds from redemption requests received on holidays when wire transfers are restricted will be wired the following business day.
⟦s000292⟧ Questions about telephone redemptions on days when wire transfers are restricted should be directed to your shareholder services representative at the telephone number listed on your account statement.
⟦s000293⟧ If at any time, the Fund shall determine it necessary to terminate or modify this method of redemption, shareholders would be promptly notified.
⟦s000294⟧ An authorization form permitting the transfer agent or the Fund to accept telephone requests must first be completed.
⟦s000295⟧ Authorization forms and information on this service are available from Federated Securities Corp. Telephone redemption instructions may be recorded.
⟦s000296⟧ If reasonable procedures are not followed by the Fund, it may be liable for losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent telephone instructions.
⟦s000297⟧ In the event of drastic economic or market changes, a shareholder may experience difficulty in redeeming by telephone.
⟦s000298⟧ If such a case should occur, another method of redemption, such as "Written Requests," should be considered.
⟦s000299⟧ WRITTEN REQUESTS Shares may also be redeemed by sending a written request to the Fund.
⟦s000300⟧ Call the Fund for specific instructions before redeeming by letter.
⟦s000301⟧ The shareholder will be asked to provide in the request his name, the Fund name, the account number, and the share or dollar amount requested.
⟦s000302⟧ If Share certificates have been issued, they should be sent unendorsed with the written request by registered or certified mail to: Federated Services Company, P.
⟦s000303⟧ O.
⟦s000304⟧ Box 8600, Boston, Massachusetts 02266-8600.
⟦s000305⟧ 12 SIGNATURES.
⟦s000306⟧ Shareholders requesting a redemption of any amount to be sent to an address other than that on record with the Fund, or a redemption payable other than to the shareholder of record must have signatures on written redemption requests guaranteed by: - a trust company or commercial bank whose deposits are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund ("BIF"), which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"); - a member of the New York, American, Boston, Midwest or Pacific Stock Exchanges; - a savings bank or savings and loan association whose deposits are insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF"), which is administered by the FDIC; or - any other "eligible guarantor institution," as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
⟦s000307⟧ The Fund does not accept signatures guaranteed by a notary public.
⟦s000308⟧ The Fund and its transfer agent have adopted standards for accepting signature guarantees from the above institutions.
⟦s000309⟧ The Fund may elect in the future to limit eligible signature guarantors to institutions that are members of a signature guarantee program.
⟦s000310⟧ The Fund and its transfer agent reserve the right to amend these standards at any time without notice.
⟦s000311⟧ Normally, a check for the proceeds is mailed within one business day, but in no event more than seven days, after receipt of a proper written redemption request.
⟦s000312⟧ ACCOUNTS WITH LOW BALANCES Due to the high cost of maintaining accounts with low balances, the Fund may redeem shares in any account and pay the proceeds to the shareholder if the account balance falls below a required minimum value of $25,000 due to shareholder redemptions.
⟦s000313⟧ This requirement does not apply, however, if the balance falls below $25,000 because of changes in the Fund's net asset value.
⟦s000314⟧ Before shares are redeemed to close an account, the shareholder is notified in writing and allowed 30 days to purchase additional shares to meet the minimum requirement.
⟦s000315⟧ SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- VOTING RIGHTS Each share gives the shareholder one vote in Director elections and other matters submitted to shareholders for vote.
⟦s000316⟧ All shares of each portfolio or class in the Fund have equal voting rights, except that only shares of that particular portfolio or class are entitled to vote in matters affecting that portfolio or class.
⟦s000317⟧ As a Maryland corporation, the Fund is not required to hold annual shareholder meetings.
⟦s000318⟧ Shareholder approval will be sought only for certain changes in the Fund's operation and for the election of Directors under certain circumstances.
⟦s000319⟧ 13 Directors may be removed by the Directors or by shareholders at a special meeting.
⟦s000320⟧ A special meeting of shareholders shall be called by the Directors upon the written request of shareholders owning at least 25% of the Fund's outstanding shares entitled to vote.
⟦s000321⟧ TAX INFORMATION -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FEDERAL INCOME TAX The Fund will pay no federal income tax because it expects to meet requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, applicable to regulated investment companies and to receive the special tax treatment afforded to such companies.
⟦s000322⟧ Unless otherwise exempt, shareholders are required to pay federal income tax on any dividends and other distributions, including capital gains distributions, received.
⟦s000323⟧ This applies whether dividends and distributions are received in cash or as additional shares.
⟦s000324⟧ Distributions representing long-term capital gains, if any, will be taxable to shareholders as long-term capital gains no matter how long the shareholders have held the shares.
⟦s000325⟧ No federal income tax is due on any dividends earned in an IRA or qualified retirement plan until distributed.
⟦s000326⟧ STATE AND LOCAL TAXES Fund shares are exempt from personal property taxes imposed by counties, municipalities and school districts in Pennsylvania.
⟦s000327⟧ Shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the status of their accounts under state and local tax laws.
⟦s000328⟧ PERFORMANCE INFORMATION -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- From time to time the Fund advertises the total return and yield for shares.
⟦s000329⟧ Total return represents the change, over a specific period of time, in the value of an investment in shares after reinvesting all income and capital gain distributions.
⟦s000330⟧ It is calculated by dividing that change by the initial investment and is expressed as a percentage.
⟦s000331⟧ The yield of the Fund is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share (as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission) earned by shares over a thirty-day period by the maximum offering price per share of shares on the last day of the period.
⟦s000332⟧ This number is then annualized using semi-annual compounding.
⟦s000333⟧ The yield does not necessarily reflect income actually earned by shares and, therefore, may not correlate to the dividends or other distributions paid to shareholders.
⟦s000334⟧ The Fund is sold without a sales charge or other similar non-recurring charges.
⟦s000335⟧ From time to time, advertisements for the Fund may refer to ratings, rankings, and other information in certain financial publications and/or compare the Fund's performance to certain indices.

⟦s000361⟧ (See Notes which are an integral part of the Financial Statements) 26 STOCK AND BOND FUND, INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OCTOBER 31, 1995 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) ORGANIZATION Stock and Bond Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a diversified, open-end, no-load, management investment company.
⟦s000362⟧ Previously, the Fund provided two classes of shares ("Class A Shares" and "Class C Shares").
⟦s000363⟧ On May 19, 1994, the Board of Directors ( the "Directors") authorized the combination of Class C Shares with Class A Shares, the termination of all contracts entered into by the Fund on behalf of Class C shares, and the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation to reclassify Class A Shares and Class C Shares as unclassified shares.
⟦s000364⟧ In connection with these actions, as of August 31, 1994, the "Class C Shares" were no longer offered.
⟦s000365⟧ (2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.
⟦s000366⟧ These policies are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
⟦s000367⟧ INVESTMENT VALUATIONS--Short-term securities with remaining maturities of sixty days or less at the time of purchase may be valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair market value.
⟦s000368⟧ All other securities are valued at prices provided by an independent pricing service.
⟦s000369⟧ REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS--It is the policy of the Fund to require the custodian bank to take possession, to have legally segregated in the Federal Reserve Book Entry System, or to have segregated within the custodian bank's vault, all securities held as collateral under repurchase agreement transactions.
⟦s000370⟧ Additionally, procedures have been established by the Fund to monitor, on a daily basis, the market value of each repurchase agreement's collateral to ensure that the value of collateral at least equals the repurchase price to be paid under the repurchase agreement transaction.
⟦s000371⟧ The Fund will only enter into repurchase agreements with banks and other recognized financial institutions, such as broker/dealers, which are deemed by the Fund's adviser to be creditworthy pursuant to the guidelines and/or standards reviewed or established by the Board of Directors (the "Directors").
⟦s000372⟧ Risks may arise from the potential inability of counterparties to honor the terms of the repurchase agreement.
⟦s000373⟧ Accordingly, the Fund could receive less than the repurchase price on the sale of collateral securities.
⟦s000374⟧ INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS--Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
⟦s000375⟧ Interest income and expenses are accrued daily.
⟦s000376⟧ Bond premium and discount, if applicable, are amortized as required by the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code").
⟦s000377⟧ 27 STOCK AND BOND FUND, INC. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FEDERAL TAXES--It is the Fund's policy to comply with the provisions of the Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute to shareholders each year substantially all of its income.
⟦s000378⟧ Accordingly, no provisions for federal tax are necessary.
⟦s000379⟧ EQUALIZATION--The Fund follows the accounting practice known as equalization, in which a portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of redemptions of fund shares equivalent, on a per share basis, equal to the amount of undistributed net investment income on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed net investment income.
⟦s000380⟧ As a result, undistributed net investment income per share is unaffected by sales or redemptions of fund shares.
⟦s000381⟧ WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS--The Fund may engage in when-issued or delayed delivery transactions.
⟦s000382⟧ The Fund records when-issued securities on the trade date and maintains security positions such that sufficient liquid assets will be available to make payment for the securities purchased.
⟦s000383⟧ Securities purchased on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis are marked to market daily and begin earning interest on the settlement date.
⟦s000384⟧ OTHER--Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date.
⟦s000385⟧ (3) CAPITAL STOCK At October 31, 1995, there were 2,000,000,000 shares of $0.
⟦s000386⟧ 001 par value capital stock authorized : Transactions in capital stock were as follows:

⟦s000392⟧ The Adviser can modify or terminate this voluntary waiver and/ or reimbursement at any time at its sole discretion.
⟦s000393⟧ ADMINISTRATIVE FEE--Federated Administrative Services ("FAS"), under the Administrative Services Agreement, provides the Fund with administrative personnel and services.
⟦s000394⟧ This fee is based on the level of average aggregate daily net assets of all funds advised by subsidiaries of Federated Investors for the period.
⟦s000395⟧ The administrative fee received during the period of the Administrative Services Agreement shall be at least $125,000 per portfolio and $30,000 per each additional class of shares.
⟦s000396⟧ SHAREHOLDER SERVICES FEE--Under the terms of a Shareholder Services Agreement with Federated Shareholder Services ("FSS"), the Fund will pay FSS up to .

⟦s000398⟧ This fee is to obtain certain services for shareholders and to maintain shareholder accounts.
⟦s000399⟧ FSS may voluntarily choose to waive a portion of its fee.
⟦s000400⟧ FSS can modify or terminate this voluntary waiver at any time at its sole discretion.
⟦s000401⟧ TRANSFER AGENT AND DIVIDEND DISBURSING AGENT FEES AND EXPENSES--Federated Services Company ("Fserv") serves as transfer and dividend disbursing agent for the Fund.

⟦s000422⟧ The name of the Fund was Boston Foundation Fund Incorporated prior to January 11, 1985 .
⟦s000423⟧ On April 16, 1993, the shareholders voted to permit the Fund to offer separate series and classes of shares.
⟦s000424⟧ During the fiscal year ended October 31, 1994, the Fund offered Class A Shares and Class C Shares.
⟦s000425⟧ On August 31, 1994, a reorganization of the Fund was completed to eliminate the separate classes of shares.
⟦s000426⟧ INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The Fund's investment objectives are to provide relative safety of capital with the possibility of long-term growth of capital and income.
⟦s000427⟧ Consideration is also given to current income.
⟦s000428⟧ The investment objectives cannot be changed without approval of shareholders.
⟦s000429⟧ As a matter of investment policy, under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 65% of its total assets in stocks and bonds.
⟦s000430⟧ TYPES OF INVESTMENTS The Fund invests primarily in a diversified portfolio of common and preferred stocks and other equity securities, bonds, notes, U.
⟦s000431⟧ S.
⟦s000432⟧ government securities, repurchase agreements, short-term obligations and instruments secured by any of these obligations.
⟦s000433⟧ OBLIGATIONS OF FOREIGN ISSUERS Obligations of a foreign issuer may present greater risks than investments in U.
⟦s000434⟧ S.
⟦s000435⟧ securities, including higher transaction costs as well as the imposition of additional taxes by foreign governments.
⟦s000436⟧ In addition, investments in foreign issuers may include additional risks associated with less complete financial information about the issuers, less market liquidity, and political instability.
⟦s000437⟧ Future political and economic developments, the possible imposition of withholding taxes on interest income, the possible seizure or nationalization of foreign holdings, the possible establishment of exchange controls, or the adoption of other governmental restrictions might adversely affect the payment of principal and interest on obligations of foreign issuers.
⟦s000438⟧ As a matter of practice, the Fund will not invest in the obligations of a foreign issuer if any such risk appears to the Fund's adviser to be substantial.
⟦s000439⟧ TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS The Fund may also invest in temporary investments from time to time for defensive purposes.
⟦s000440⟧ MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS The Fund may invest in money market instruments such as: oinstruments of domestic and foreign banks and savings and loans if they have capital, surplus, and undivided profits of over $100,000,000, or if the principal amount of the instrument is federally insured; or ocommercial paper rated A-1 by Standard and Poor's Ratings Group, Prime-1 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or F-1 by Fitch Investors Service, Inc. WHEN-ISSUED AND DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS The Fund engages in when-issued and delayed delivery transactions only for the purpose of acquiring portfolio securities consistent with the Fund's objectives and policies, not for investment leverage.
⟦s000441⟧ These transactions are made to secure what is considered to be an advantageous price or yield for the Fund.
⟦s000442⟧ Settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these transactions, and the market values of the securities purchased may vary from the purchase prices.
⟦s000443⟧ No fees or other expenses, other than normal transaction costs, are incurred.
⟦s000444⟧ However, liquid assets of the Fund sufficient to make payment for the securities to be purchased are segregated on the Fund's records at the trade date.
⟦s000445⟧ These assets are marked to market daily and are maintained until the transaction has been settled.
⟦s000446⟧ As a matter of operating policy, which may be changed without shareholder approval, the Fund does not intend to engage in when-issued and delayed delivery transactions to an extent that would cause the segregation of more than 20% of the total value of its assets.
⟦s000447⟧ LENDING PORTFOLIO SECURITIES The collateral received when the Fund lends portfolio securities must be valued daily and, should the market value of the loaned securities increase, the borrower must furnish additional collateral to the Fund.
⟦s000448⟧ During the time portfolio securities are on loan, the borrower pays the Fund any dividends or interest paid on such securities.
⟦s000449⟧ Loans are subject to termination at the option of the Fund or the borrower.
⟦s000450⟧ The Fund may pay reasonable administrative and custodial fees in connection with a loan and may pay a negotiated portion of the interest earned on the cash or equivalent collateral to the borrower or placing broker.
⟦s000451⟧ The Fund does not have the right to vote securities on loan, but would terminate the loan and regain the right to vote if that were considered important with respect to the investment.
⟦s000452⟧ REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS The Fund may also enter into reverse repurchase agreements under certain circumstances.
⟦s000453⟧ This transaction is similar to borrowing cash.
⟦s000454⟧ In a reverse repurchase agreement, the Fund transfers possession of a portfolio instrument to another person, such as a financial institution, broker, or dealer, in return for a percentage of the instrument's market value in cash, and agrees that on a stipulated date in the future, the Fund will repurchase the portfolio instrument by remitting the original consideration plus interest at an agreed upon rate.
⟦s000455⟧ The use of reverse repurchase agreements may enable the Fund to avoid selling portfolio instruments at a time when a sale may be deemed to be disadvantageous, but the ability to enter into reverse repurchase agreements does not ensure that the Fund will be able to avoid selling portfolio instruments at a disadvantageous time.
⟦s000456⟧ When effecting reverse repurchase agreements, liquid assets of the Fund, in a dollar amount sufficient to make payment for the obligations to be purchased, are segregated at the trade date.
⟦s000457⟧ These securities are marked to market daily and are maintained until the transaction is settled.
⟦s000458⟧ RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES The Fund may invest in commercial paper issued in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.
⟦s000459⟧ Section 4(2) commercial paper is restricted as to disposition under federal securities law and is generally sold to institutional investors, such as the Fund, who agree that they are purchasing the paper for investment purposes and not with a view to public distribution.
⟦s000460⟧ Any resale by the purchaser must be in an exempt transaction.
⟦s000461⟧ Section 4(2) commercial paper is normally resold to other institutional investors like the Fund through or with the assistance of the issuer or investment dealers who make a market in Section 4(2) commercial paper, thus providing liquidity.
⟦s000462⟧ The ability of the Board of Directors ("Directors") to determine the liquidity of certain restricted securities is permitted under a Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Staff position set forth in the adopting release for Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Rule").
⟦s000463⟧ The Rule is a non-exclusive safe-harbor for certain secondary market transactions involving securities subject to restrictions on resale under federal securities laws.
⟦s000464⟧ The Rule provides an exemption from registration for resales of otherwise restricted securities to qualified institutional buyers.
⟦s000465⟧ The Rule was expected to further enhance the liquidity of the secondary market for securities eligible for resale under the Rule.
⟦s000466⟧ The Fund believes that the Staff of the SEC has left the question of determining the liquidity of all restricted securities to the Directors.
⟦s000467⟧ The Directors may consider the following criteria in determining the liquidity of certain restricted securities: o the frequency of trades and quotes for the security; o the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential buyers; o dealer undertakings to make a market in the security; and o the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace trades.
⟦s000468⟧ PORTFOLIO TURNOVER The Fund normally holds or disposes of portfolio securities in order to work toward its investment objectives.
⟦s000469⟧ Securities held by the Fund are selected because they are considered to represent real value and will be held or disposed of accordingly.
⟦s000470⟧ The Fund's investment adviser will not generally seek profits through short-term trading.
⟦s000471⟧ The Fund will not attempt to set or meet a portfolio turnover rate since any turnover would be incidental to transactions undertaken in an attempt to achieve the Fund's investment objectives.
⟦s000472⟧ For the fiscal years ended October 31, 1995 and 1994, the portfolio turnover rates were 68% and 45%, respectively.
⟦s000473⟧ INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS SELLING SHORT AND BUYING ON MARGIN The Fund will not sell any securities short or purchase any securities on margin.
⟦s000474⟧ ISSUING SENIOR SECURITIES AND BORROWING MONEY The Fund will not issue senior securities, except as permitted by its investment objectives and policies, and except that the Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements and otherwise borrow up to one-third of the value of its net assets including the amount borrowed, as a temporary, extraordinary or emergency measure or to facilitate management of the portfolio by enabling the Fund to meet redemption requests when the liquidation of portfolio instruments would be inconvenient or disadvantageous.
⟦s000475⟧ This practice is not for investment leverage.
⟦s000476⟧ The Fund will not purchase any portfolio instruments while any borrowings (including reverse repurchase agreements) are outstanding.
⟦s000477⟧ DIVERSIFICATION OF INVESTMENTS The Fund will not invest more than 5% of the value of its total assets in the securities of any one issuer, except U.
⟦s000478⟧ S.
⟦s000479⟧ government securities; invest in more than 10% of the voting securities of one issuer; or invest in more than 10% of any class of securities of one issuer.
⟦s000480⟧ ACQUIRING SECURITIES The Fund will not invest in securities issued by any other investment company or investment trust except in regular open-market transactions or as part of a plan of merger or consolidation.
⟦s000481⟧ It will not invest in securities of a company for the purpose of exercising control or management.
⟦s000482⟧ INVESTING IN NEW ISSUERS The Fund will not invest more than 5% of the value of its total assets in securities of issuers which have records of less than three years of continuous operations.
⟦s000483⟧ SELLING SECURITIES The Fund may not sell any security or evidence of interest therein unless it is owned by the Fund and available for delivery.
⟦s000484⟧ INVESTING IN COMMODITIES, COMMODITY CONTRACTS, OR REAL ESTATE The Fund will not invest in commodities, commodity contracts, or real estate.
⟦s000485⟧ UNDERWRITING The Fund will not engage in underwriting or agency distribution of securities issued by others.
⟦s000486⟧ LENDING CASH OR SECURITIES The Fund will not lend any assets except portfolio securities.
⟦s000487⟧ The purchase of corporate or government bonds, debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness shall not be considered a loan for purposes of this limitation.
⟦s000488⟧ CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS The Fund will not invest more than 25% of the value of its total assets in securities of companies in any one industry.
⟦s000489⟧ INVESTING IN WARRANTS The Fund will not invest more than 5% of its assets in warrants, including those acquired in units or attached to other securities.
⟦s000490⟧ To comply with certain state restrictions, the Fund will limit its investment in such warrants not listed on recognized stock exchanges to 2% of its total assets.
⟦s000491⟧ (If state restrictions change, this latter restriction may be revised without notice to shareholders.
⟦s000492⟧ ) For purposes of this investment restriction, warrants acquired by the Fund in units or attached to securities may be deemed to be without value.
⟦s000493⟧ The above limitations cannot be changed without shareholder approval.
⟦s000494⟧ The following limitations, however, may be changed by the Directors without shareholder approval.
⟦s000495⟧ Shareholders will be notified before any material change in these limitations becomes effective.
⟦s000496⟧ INVESTING IN ISSUERS WHOSE SECURITIES ARE OWNED BY OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE FUND The Fund will not purchase or retain the securities of any issuer in which the officers and Directors of the Fund or its investment adviser own a substantial financial interest.
⟦s000497⟧ INVESTING IN RESTRICTED SECURITIES The Fund will not invest more than 10% of its total assets in securities subject to restrictions on resale under the Securities Act of 1933, except for commercial paper issued under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and certain other restricted securities which meet the criteria for liquidity as established by the Directors.
⟦s000498⟧ To comply with certain state restrictions, the Fund will limit these transactions to 5% of its total assets.
⟦s000499⟧ (If state restrictions change, this latter restriction may be revised without shareholder approval or notification.
⟦s000500⟧ ) INVESTING IN ILLIQUID SECURITIES The Fund will not invest more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities, including repurchase agreements providing for settlement more than seven days after notice and certain restricted securities not determined by the Directors to be liquid.
⟦s000501⟧ To comply with certain state restrictions, the Fund will limit these transactions to 10% of its net assets.
⟦s000502⟧ (If state restrictions change, this latter restriction may be revised without shareholder approval or notification.
⟦s000503⟧ ) If a percentage limitation is adhered to at the time of investment, a later increase or decrease in percentage resulting from any change in value or net assets will not result in a violation of such restriction.
⟦s000504⟧ The Fund did not borrow money or lend portfolio securities in excess of 5% of the value of its net assets during the last fiscal year and has no present intent to do so in the coming fiscal year.
⟦s000505⟧ In addition, to comply with certain state restrictions, the Fund will not invest in oil, gas, or other mineral leases, nor will it invest in real estate limited partnerships.
⟦s000506⟧ If state restrictions change, these limitations may be revised without notice to shareholders.

⟦s000607⟧ Donahue, his wife, and his son, J.
⟦s000608⟧ Christopher Donahue.
⟦s000609⟧ The adviser shall not be liable to the Fund or any shareholder for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding, or sale of any security or for anything done or omitted by it, except acts or omissions involving willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties imposed upon it by its contract with the Fund.
⟦s000610⟧ ADVISORY FEES For its advisory services, Federated Management receives an annual investment advisory fee as described in the prospectus.
⟦s000611⟧ During the fiscal years ended October 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, the Fund's adviser earned $979,379, $945,715, and $834,842, respectively, of which $215,192, $98,828, and $222,090, respectively, was voluntarily waived because of undertakings to limit the Fund's expenses.
⟦s000612⟧ All advisory fees were computed on the same basis as described in the prospectus.
⟦s000613⟧ STATE EXPENSE LIMITATIONS The adviser has undertaken to comply with the expense limitations established by certain states for investment companies whose shares are registered for sale in those states.
⟦s000614⟧ If the Fund's normal operating expenses (including the investment advisory fee, but not including brokerage commissions, interest, taxes and extraordinary expenses) exceed 2 1/2% per year of the first $30 million of average net assets, 2% per year of the next $70 million of average net assets, and 1 1/2% per year of the remaining average net assets, the adviser will reimburse the Fund for its expenses over the limitation.
⟦s000615⟧ If the Fund's monthly projected operating expenses exceed this limitation, the investment advisory fee paid will be reduced by the amount of the excess, subject to an annual adjustment.
⟦s000616⟧ If the expense limitation is exceeded, the amount to be reimbursed by the adviser will be limited, in any single fiscal year, by the amount of the investment advisory fee.
⟦s000617⟧ This arrangement is not part of the advisory contract and may be amended or rescinded in the future.
⟦s000618⟧ BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS The adviser may select brokers and dealers who offer brokerage and research services.
⟦s000619⟧ These services may be furnished directly to the Fund or to the adviser and may include: advice as to the advisability of investing in securities; security analysis and reports; economic studies; industry studies; receipt of quotations for portfolio evaluations; and similar services.
⟦s000620⟧ Research services provided by brokers and dealers may be used by the adviser or its affiliates in advising the Fund and other accounts.
⟦s000621⟧ To the extent that receipt of these services may supplant services for which the adviser or its affiliates might otherwise have paid, it would tend to reduce their expenses.
⟦s000622⟧ The adviser and its affiliates exercise reasonable business judgment in selecting brokers who offer brokerage and research services to execute securities transactions.
⟦s000623⟧ They determine in good faith that commissions charged by such persons are reasonable in relationship to the value of the brokerage and research services provided.
⟦s000624⟧ During the fiscal years ended October 31, 1995, 1994, and 1993, the Fund paid total brokerage commissions of $84,056, $41,256, and $69,262, respectively.
⟦s000625⟧ As of October 31, 1995, the Fund owned $952,733 of securities of Travelers Inc. (Smith Barney) and $931,021 of securities of Dean Witter, two of its regular brokers that derive more than 15% of gross revenues from securities- related activities.
⟦s000626⟧ Although investment decisions for the Fund are made independently from those of the other accounts managed by the adviser, investments of the type the Fund may make may also be made by those other accounts.
⟦s000627⟧ When the Fund and one or more other accounts managed by the adviser are prepared to invest in, or desire to dispose of, the same security, available investments or opportunities for sales will be allocated in a manner believed by the adviser to be equitable to each.
⟦s000628⟧ In some cases, this procedure may adversely affect the price paid or received by the Fund or the size of the position obtained or disposed of by the Fund.
⟦s000629⟧ In other cases, however, it is believed that coordination and the ability to participate in volume transactions will be to the benefit of the Fund.
⟦s000630⟧ OTHER RELATED SERVICES Affiliates of the adviser may, from time to time, provide certain electronic equipment and software to institutional customers in order to facilitate the purchase of shares of funds offered by Federated Securities Corp. OTHER SERVICES FUND ADMINISTRATION Federated Administrative Services, a subsidiary of Federated Investors, provides administrative personnel and services to the Fund for a fee as described in the prospectus.
⟦s000631⟧ Prior to March 1, 1994, Federated Administrative Services Inc., also a subsidiary of Federated Investors, served as the Fund's administrator.
⟦s000632⟧ (For purposes of this Statement of Additional Information, Federated Administrative Services and Federated Administrative Services, Inc., may hereinafter collectively be referred to as the "Administrators".

⟦s000639⟧ It also provides certain accounting and recordkeeping services with respect to the Fund's portfolio investments.
⟦s000640⟧ TRANSFER AGENT AND DIVIDEND DISBURSING AGENT As transfer agent, Federated Services Company, maintains all necessary shareholder records.
⟦s000641⟧ For its services, the transfer agent receives a fee based on the size, type, and number of accounts and transactions made by shareholders.
⟦s000642⟧ INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The independent auditors for the Fund are Deloitte & Touche LLP, 2500 One PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222-5014.
⟦s000643⟧ SHAREHOLDER SERVICES AGREEMENT This arrangement permits the payment of fees to Federated Shareholder Services and to financial institutions to cause services to be provided to shareholders by a representative who has knowledge of the shareholder's particular circumstances and goals.
⟦s000644⟧ These activities and services may include, but are not limited to: providing office space, equipment, telephone facilities, and various clerical, supervisory, computer, and other personnel as necessary or beneficial to establish and maintain shareholder accounts and records; processing purchase and redemption transactions and automatic investments of client account cash balances; answering routine client inquiries; and assisting clients in changing dividend options, account designations, and addresses.
⟦s000645⟧ By adopting the Shareholder Services Agreement, the Directors expect that the Fund will benefit by (1) providing personal services to the shareholders; (2) investing shareholder assets with a minimum of delay and administrative detail; (3) enhancing shareholder recordkeeping systems; and (4) responding promptly to shareholder's requests and inquiries concerning their accounts.
⟦s000646⟧ For the fiscal year ended October 31, 1995, the Fund paid shareholder services fees in the amount of $320,244 of which $178,558 was waived, all of which were paid to financial institutions.
⟦s000647⟧ PURCHASING SHARES Shares are sold at their net asset value without a sales charge on days the New York Stock Exchange is open for business.
⟦s000648⟧ The procedure for purchasing shares is explained in the respective prospectus under "Investing in the Fund.
⟦s000649⟧ " CONVERSION TO FEDERAL FUNDS The Fund's transfer agent acts as the shareholder's agent in depositing checks and converting them to federal funds.
⟦s000650⟧ DETERMINING NET ASSET VALUE Net asset value generally changes each day.
⟦s000651⟧ The days on which net asset value is calculated by the Fund are described in the prospectus.
⟦s000652⟧ DETERMINING MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES Market values of the Fund's portfolio securities are determined as follows: o for equity securities, according to the last sale price on a national securities exchange, if available; o in the absence of recorded sales for equity securities, according to the mean between the last closing bid and asked prices; o for bonds and other fixed income securities, at the last sale price on a national securities exchange if available, otherwise as determined by an independent pricing service; o for short-term obligations, according to the mean between the bid and asked prices as furnished by an independent pricing service; or o for all other securities, at fair value as determined in good faith by the Directors.
⟦s000653⟧ Prices provided by independent pricing services may be determined without relying exclusively on quoted prices and may reflect institutional trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other market data.
⟦s000654⟧ REDEEMING SHARES The Fund redeems shares at the next computed net asset value after the Fund receives the redemption request.
⟦s000655⟧ Redemption procedures and any fees are explained in the prospectus under "Redeeming Shares.
⟦s000656⟧ " Although the Fund's transfer agent does not charge for telephone redemptions, it reserves the right to charge a fee for the cost of wire-transferred redemptions of less than $5,000.
⟦s000657⟧ REDEMPTION IN KIND The Fund is obligated to redeem shares solely in cash up to $250,000 or 1% of the Fund's net asset value, whichever is less, for any one shareholder within a 90-day period.
⟦s000658⟧ Any redemption beyond this amount will also be in cash unless the Directors determine that payments should be in kind.
⟦s000659⟧ In such a case, the Fund will pay all or a portion of the remainder of the redemption in portfolio instruments, valued in the same way that net asset value is determined.
⟦s000660⟧ The portfolio instruments will be selected in a manner that the Directors deem fair and equitable.
⟦s000661⟧ Redemption in kind is not as liquid as a cash redemption.
⟦s000662⟧ If redemption is made in kind, shareholders receiving their securities and selling them before their maturity could receive less than the redemption value of their securities and could incur transaction costs.
⟦s000663⟧ TAX STATUS THE FUND'S TAX STATUS The Fund will pay no federal income tax because it expects to meet the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, applicable to regulated investment companies and to receive the special tax treatment afforded to such companies.
⟦s000664⟧ To qualify for this treatment, the Fund must, among other requirements: o derive at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, and gains from the sale of securities; o derive less than 30% of its gross income from the sale of securities held less than three months; o invest in securities within certain statutory limits; and o distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its net income earned during the year.
⟦s000665⟧ SHAREHOLDERS' TAX STATUS Shareholders are subject to federal income tax on dividends and capital gains received as cash or additional shares.
⟦s000666⟧ The dividends received deduction for corporations will apply to ordinary income distributions to the extent the distribution represents amounts that would qualify for the dividends received deduction to the Fund if the Fund were a regular corporation and to the extent designated by the Fund as so qualifying.
⟦s000667⟧ These dividends and any short-term capital gains are taxable as ordinary income.
⟦s000668⟧ CAPITAL GAINS Long-term capital gains distributed to shareholders will be treated as long-term capital gains regardless of how long shareholders have held the shares.
⟦s000669⟧ TOTAL RETURN The Fund's average annual total returns for the one-year, five-year, and ten- year periods ended October 31, 1995, were 17.
⟦s000670⟧ 99%, 11.
⟦s000671⟧ 99% and 9.
⟦s000672⟧ 90%, respectively.
⟦s000673⟧ Average annual total return is the average compounded rate of return for a given period that would equate a $1,000 initial investment to the ending redeemable value of that investment.
⟦s000674⟧ The ending redeemable value is computed by multiplying the number of shares owned at the end of the period by the maximum offering price per share at the end of the period.
⟦s000675⟧ The number of shares owned at the end of the period is based on the number of shares purchased at the beginning of the period with $1,000, adjusted over the period by any additional shares, assuming the quarterly reinvestment of all dividends and distributions.
⟦s000676⟧ YIELD The Fund's SEC yield for the thirty-day period ended October 31, 1995, was 3.
⟦s000677⟧ 64%.
⟦s000678⟧ The yield for the Fund is determined by dividing the net investment income per share (as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission) earned by the Fund over a thirty-day period by the maximum offering price per share of the Fund on the last day of the period.
⟦s000679⟧ This value is then annualized using semi-annual compounding.
⟦s000680⟧ This means that the amount of income generated during the thirty-day period is assumed to be generated each month over a twelve-month period and is reinvested every six months.
⟦s000681⟧ The yield does not necessarily reflect income actually earned by the Fund because of certain adjustments required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, may not correlate to the dividends or other distributions paid to shareholders.
⟦s000682⟧ To the extent that financial institutions and broker/dealers charge fees in connection with services provided in conjunction with an investment in the Fund, performance will be reduced for those shareholders paying those fees.
⟦s000683⟧ PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS The Fund's performance depends upon such variables as: o portfolio quality; o average portfolio maturity; o type of instruments in which the portfolio is invested; o changes in interest rates and market value of portfolio securities; o changes in the Fund's expenses; and o various other factors.
⟦s000684⟧ The Fund's performance fluctuates on a daily basis largely because net earnings and offering price per share fluctuate daily.
⟦s000685⟧ Both net earnings and offering price per share are factors in the computation of yield and total return.
⟦s000686⟧ Investors may use financial publications and/or indices to obtain a more complete view of the Fund's performance.
⟦s000687⟧ When comparing performance, investors should consider all relevant factors such as the composition of any index used, prevailing market conditions, portfolio compositions of other funds, and methods used to value portfolio securities and compute offering price.
⟦s000688⟧ The financial publications and/or indices which the Fund uses in advertising may include: STANDARD & POOR'S RATING GROUP DAILY STOCK PRICE INDEX OF 500 COMMON STOCKS is a composite index of common stocks in industry, transportation, and financial and public utility companies, and compares total returns of funds whose portfolios are invested primarily in common stocks.
⟦s000689⟧ In addition, the index assumes reinvestment of all dividends paid by stocks listed on its index.
⟦s000690⟧ Taxes due on any of these distributions are not included nor are brokerage or other fees calculated in these figures.
⟦s000691⟧ SALOMON BROTHERS AAA-AA CORPORATES calculates total returns of approximately 775 issues, which include long-term, high-grade domestic corporate taxable bonds, rated AAA-AA, with maturities of twelve years or more.
⟦s000692⟧ It also includes companies in industry, public utilities, and finance.
⟦s000693⟧ LIPPER ANALYTICAL SERVICES, INC., ranks funds in various categories by making comparative calculations using total return.
⟦s000694⟧ Total return assumes the reinvestment of all capital gains distributions and income dividends and takes into account any change in net asset value over a specific period of time.
⟦s000695⟧ From time to time, the Fund will quote its Lipper ranking in advertising and sales literature.
⟦s000696⟧ LEHMAN BROTHERS GOVERNMENT/CORPORATE (TOTAL) is comprised of approximately 5,000 issues which include non-convertible bonds publicly issued by the U.
⟦s000697⟧ S.
⟦s000698⟧ government or its agencies; corporate bonds guaranteed by the U.
⟦s000699⟧ S.
⟦s000700⟧ government and quasi-federal corporations; and publicly issued, fixed rate, non-convertible domestic bonds of companies in industry, public utilities, and finance.
⟦s000701⟧ The average maturity of these bonds approximates nine years.
⟦s000702⟧ Tracked by Lehman Brothers, Inc., the index calculates total returns for one-month, three-month, twelve-month, and ten-year periods and year-to-date.
⟦s000703⟧ S&P 500/LEHMAN BROTHERS GOVERNMENT/CORPORATE (WEIGHTED INDEX) AND THE S&P 500/ LEHMAN BROTHERS GOVERNMENT (WEIGHTED INDEX) combine the components of a stock-oriented index and a bond-oriented index to obtain results which can be compared to the performance of a managed fund.
⟦s000704⟧ The indices' total returns will be assigned various weights depending upon the Fund's current asset allocation.
⟦s000705⟧ MORNINGSTAR, INC., an independent rating service, is the publisher of the bi-weekly Mutual Fund Values.
⟦s000706⟧ Mutual Fund Values rates more than 1,000 NASDAQ-listed mutual funds of all types, according to their risk-adjusted returns.
⟦s000707⟧ The maximum rating is five stars, and ratings are effective for two weeks.
⟦s000708⟧ Investors may also consult the fund evaluation consulting universe listed below.
⟦s000709⟧ Consulting universes may be composed of pension, profit-sharing, commingled, endowment/foundation and mutual funds.
⟦s000710⟧ SEI BALANCED UNIVERSE is composed of 916 portfolios managed by 390 managers representing $86 billion in assets.
⟦s000711⟧ To be included in the universe, a portfolio must contain a 5% minimum commitment in both equity and fixed income securities.
⟦s000712⟧ Advertisements and other sales literature for the Fund may quote total returns which are calculated on non-standardized base periods.
⟦s000713⟧ These total returns also represent the historic change in the value of an investment in the Fund based on quarterly reinvestment of dividends over a specified period of time.
⟦s000714⟧ DURATION Duration is a commonly used measure of the potential volatility in the price of a bond, other fixed income security, or in a portfolio of fixed income securities, prior to maturity.
⟦s000715⟧ Volatility is the magnitude of the change in the price of a bond relative to a given change in the market rate of interest.
⟦s000716⟧ A bond's price volatility depends on three primary variables: the bond's coupon rate; maturity date; and the level of market yields of similar fixed-income securities.
⟦s000717⟧ Generally, bonds with lower coupons or longer maturities will be more volatile than bonds with higher coupons or shorter maturities.
⟦s000718⟧ Duration combines these variables into a single measure.
⟦s000719⟧ Duration is calculated by dividing the sum of the time-weighted values of the cash flows of a bond or bonds, including interest and principal payments, by the sum of the present values of the cash flows.
⟦s000720⟧ When the Fund invests in mortgage pass-through securities, its duration will be calculated in a manner which requires assumptions to be made regarding future capital prepayments.
⟦s000721⟧ A more complete description of this calculation is available upon request from the Fund.

⟦s000749⟧ *source: Investment Company Institute APPENDIX STANDARD AND POOR'S RATINGS GROUP CORPORATE BOND RATINGS AAA--Debt rated AAA has the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P").
⟦s000750⟧ Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong.
⟦s000751⟧ AA--Debt rated AA has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal and differs from the higher rated issues only in small degree.
⟦s000752⟧ A--Debt rated A has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higher rated categories.
⟦s000753⟧ BBB--Debt rated BBB is regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal.
⟦s000754⟧ Whereas it normally exhibits adequate protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for debt in this category than in higher rated categories.
⟦s000755⟧ NR--NR indicates that no public rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular type of obligation as a matter of policy.
⟦s000756⟧ MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC., CORPORATE BOND RATINGS AAA--Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality.
⟦s000757⟧ They carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt edged.
⟦s000758⟧ " Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure.
⟦s000759⟧ While the various protective elements are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues.
⟦s000760⟧ AA--Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards.
⟦s000761⟧ Together with the Aaa group, they comprise what are generally known as high-grade bonds.
⟦s000762⟧ They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa securities.
⟦s000763⟧ A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations.
⟦s000764⟧ Factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.
⟦s000765⟧ BAA--Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations, (i.e.
⟦s000766⟧ , they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured).
⟦s000767⟧ Interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time.
⟦s000768⟧ Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and, in fact, have speculative characteristics as well.
⟦s000769⟧ NR--Not rated by Moody's.
⟦s000770⟧ Moody's applies numerical modifiers, 1, 2, and 3 in each generic rating classification from Aa through B in corporate bond rating system.
⟦s000771⟧ The modifier 1 indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of its generic ranking category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category.
⟦s000772⟧ FITCH INVESTORS SERVICE, INC., LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS AAA--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality.
⟦s000773⟧ The obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest and repay principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable events.
⟦s000774⟧ AA--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality.
⟦s000775⟧ The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong, although not quite as strong as bonds rated AAA.
⟦s000776⟧ Because bonds rated in the AAA and AA categories are not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable future developments, short-term debt of these issuers is generally rated F-1+.
⟦s000777⟧ A--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality.
⟦s000778⟧ The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.
⟦s000779⟧ BBB--Bonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit quality.
⟦s000780⟧ The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered to be adequate.
⟦s000781⟧ Adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances, however, are more likely to have adverse impact on these bonds and, therefore, impair timely payment.
⟦s000782⟧ The likelihood that the ratings of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than bonds with higher ratings.
⟦s000783⟧ NR--NR indicates that Fitch does not rate the specific issue.
⟦s000784⟧ PLUS (+) OR MINUS (-): Plus and minus signs are used with a rating symbol to indicate the relative position of a credit within the rating category.
⟦s000785⟧ Plus and minus signs, however, are not used in the AAA category.
⟦s000786⟧ STANDARD AND POOR'S RATINGS GROUP COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS A-1--This designation indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely payment is strong.
⟦s000787⟧ Those issues determined to possess extremely strong safety characteristics are denoted with a plus (+) sign designation.
⟦s000788⟧ A-2--Capacity for timely payment on issues with this designation is satisfactory.
⟦s000789⟧ However, the relative degree of safety is not as high as for issues designated A-1.
⟦s000790⟧ MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC., COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS PRIME-1- Issuers rated Prime-1 (or related supporting institutions) have a superior capacity for repayment of short-term promissory obligations.
⟦s000791⟧ Prime- 1 repayment capacity will normally be evidenced by the following characteristics: o Leading market positions in well established industries.
⟦s000792⟧ o High rates of return on funds employed.
⟦s000793⟧ o Conservative capitalization structure with moderate reliance on debt and ample asset protection.
⟦s000794⟧ o Broad margins in earning coverage of fixed financial charges and high internal cash generation.
⟦s000795⟧ o Well-established access to a range of financial markets and assured sources of alternate liquidity.
⟦s000796⟧ PRIME-2- Issuers rated Prime-2 (or related supporting institutions) have a strong capacity for repayment of short- term promissory obligations.
⟦s000797⟧ This will normally be evidenced by many of the characteristics cited above, but to a lesser degree.
⟦s000798⟧ Earnings trends and coverage ratios, while sound, will be more subject to variation.
⟦s000799⟧ Capitalization characteristics, while still appropriate, may be more affected by external conditions.
⟦s000800⟧ Ample alternate liquidity is maintained.
⟦s000801⟧ FITCH INVESTORS SERVICE, INC., SHORT-TERM RATINGS F-1+ --(Exceptionally Strong Credit Quality).
⟦s000802⟧ Issues assigned this rating are regarded as having the strongest degree of assurance for timely payment.

⟦s000807⟧ STOCK AND BOND FUND, INC. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ANNUAL REPORT FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 1995 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The fiscal year ended October 31, 1995 was very positive for high quality fixed income securities.
⟦s000808⟧ For much of calendar year 1995, the majority of economic releases seemed to point toward a slowing economy coupled with consistent declines in inflation.
⟦s000809⟧ As a result, after peaking in yield levels during November 1994, all maturity points experienced significant yield declines for the remainder of the fiscal year.
⟦s000810⟧ As reference points, the 2-year, 5-year, and 30-year Treasury securities Cusip 86101A104 8012905B (12/95) decreased in yield for the entire fiscal year by 130, 177, and 173 basis points, respectively.
⟦s000811⟧ Starting early in the fiscal year, fund management significantly increased the allocation to investment grade corporate securities while decreasing the Treasury allocation and relatively maintaining the mortgage allocation.
⟦s000812⟧ Specifically, corporates were increased from approximately 5% to 25%-30%.
⟦s000813⟧ In retrospect, the corporate emphasis served to enhance overall returns as the yield spread advantage over Treasuries tightened (outperformed) for most of the fiscal year.
⟦s000814⟧ With the economy exhibiting slower growth characteristics which could lead to a weaker corporate environment, the fund is reversing its allocation away from corporate securities and back toward government securities.
⟦s000815⟧ From a duration perspective, the bond portion moved to a slightly defensive position in late May 1995, decreasing duration from approximately 5.
⟦s000816⟧ 0 years to 4.
⟦s000817⟧ 25 years.
⟦s000818⟧ No significant duration changes have occurred since that time nor are any anticipated in the near future.
⟦s000819⟧ In the fiscal year ended October 31, 1995, the U.
⟦s000820⟧ S.
⟦s000821⟧ stock market advanced strongly, with the S&P 500 Index recording a total return of 26.
⟦s000822⟧ 4%.
⟦s000823⟧ This compares to a modest 3.
⟦s000824⟧ 9% for the 12 months ended October 31, 1994.
⟦s000825⟧ Total return for Stock and Bond Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") in the latest fiscal year was 17.
⟦s000826⟧ 99% vs. 19.
⟦s000827⟧ 8% for the average Lipper Balanced Fund (Lipper Analytical Services, Inc.).
⟦s000828⟧ This ranked the Fund 105 out of 216 Lipper Balanced Funds, or in the 48th percentile for the year.
⟦s000829⟧ The Fund's five year ranking as of October 31, 1995 was 47 out of 60 funds.
⟦s000830⟧ The Fund's ten year ranking as of September 30, 1995 was 29 out of 30 funds.
⟦s000831⟧ Recent market strength was concentrated in large capitalization stocks which substantially influence results of the S&P 500 Index.
⟦s000832⟧ In contrast, the Russell 2000, a popular benchmark for small cap stocks had a total return of only 16.
⟦s000833⟧ 2% for the year ended October 31, 1995.
⟦s000834⟧ Market strength over the past year has been importantly related to declining interest rates and continuing strong growth in corporate profits.
⟦s000835⟧ The 30 year U.
⟦s000836⟧ S.
⟦s000837⟧ Treasury bond yield has declined from 8.
⟦s000838⟧ 1% to roughly 6.
⟦s000839⟧ 2%.
⟦s000840⟧ Aggregate corporate earnings for U.
⟦s000841⟧ S.
⟦s000842⟧ companies have shown 12-15% gains in the past three quarters vs. 1994.
⟦s000843⟧ The consensus forecast at this time is for a rather benign inflation and interest rate environment and moderate real growth in U.
⟦s000844⟧ S.
⟦s000845⟧ economic activity, perhaps at the 2.
⟦s000846⟧ 0-2.
⟦s000847⟧ 5% level (annual rate).
⟦s000848⟧ This backdrop and the substantial rise in the stock market over the past year dictates increased selectivity in stock selection at this time.
⟦s000849⟧ The best performing sector over the past year has been Technology, although many stocks in this area have experienced corrections over the past few months.
⟦s000850⟧ We reduced our weighting in Technology a few months ago, but remain modestly overweight relative to the S&P 500, given the excellent long-term outlook.
⟦s000851⟧ The Finance sector has also performed well over the past year and the Fund continues to have a significant exposure to this group.
⟦s000852⟧ As part of our portfolio management process in determining relative sector weightings, we also attempt to identify underlying investment themes.
⟦s000853⟧ Some companies fit more than one theme.
⟦s000854⟧ At this time, the major themes in the Fund's portfolio are as follows: (1) Beneficiaries of corporate "restructuring" such as AT&T, ITT and CIGNA.
⟦s000855⟧ (2) Industry consolidation; Lockheed Martin in the aerospace/defense industry, and First Interstate in banking are examples.
⟦s000856⟧ (3) Companies which generate significant excess cash flow such as Philip Morris and FMC.
⟦s000857⟧ (4) Dominant companies with superior management; General Electric, Citicorp and Philip Morris fit this description.
⟦s000858⟧ (5) The Technology revolution; major "plays" include Hewlett Packard, IBM, and General Motors, Class "E" (EDS).
⟦s000859⟧ While some market observers express concern with overvaluation in the current market, we believe good long-term values can be identified by our disciplined process and careful fundamental research.
⟦s000860⟧ An important part of our process is our emphasis on controlling risk through diversification and attention to valuation of individual stocks.
