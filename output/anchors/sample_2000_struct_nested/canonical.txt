PFIZER SETTLES INVESTIGATION
 OF FORMER BUSINESS UNIT
Company Enters Voluntary Plea Agreement
 Related to Charges of Anti-Competitive Activities in Food Science Group, Sold
 in 1996.
NEW YORK, July 19 - Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) announced
 today that it has entered into a voluntary agreement to plead guilty to antitrust
 charges by the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice involving
 Pfizer's former Food Science Group, a division that manufactured and sold food
 additives. Pfizer sold the Food Science Group in January 1996. Pfizer does not
 believe that this settlement will have a material effect on its business or
 results of operations.
The Department of Justice has stated that no further antitrust
 charges will be brought against Pfizer relating to the former Food Science Group,
 and that there are no other pending antitrust investigations against Pfizer.
 The Department of Justice has also stated that it will not bring any charges
 against any current director, officer, or employee of Pfizer for any antitrust
 offenses involving the manufacture or sale of any products sold or produced
 by Pfizer's former Food Science Group.
In addition, the Department of Justice stated that none
 of Pfizer's current directors, officers or employees was aware of any aspect
 of the activity that gave rise to the charged Sherman Act violations. The Department
 of Justice has further stated that its investigation has uncovered no evidence
 of any antitrust violations relating to Pfizer's current business, or which
 suggests a current lack of integrity or business honesty on the part of Pfizer
 or its current management or employees.
Under the agreement, Pfizer will plead guilty in Federal
 District Court in San Francisco to one count of price fixing of sodium erythorbate,
 a food additive, and one count of market allocation of maltols, flavor enhancers.
 The Company agreed to pay a total fine of $20 million. Pfizer deeply regrets
 these actions, which were contrary to the Company's clear, long-standing values,
 policies and practices.
The two food products that are the subject of the plea
 agreement involved a small component of Pfizer's business unrelated to the Company's
 core research-based pharmaceutical business. The combined annual sales of the
 two products accounted for less than 1% of annual Pfizer sales. Both products
 were manufactured and sold by Pfizer's former Food Science Group. Pfizer has
 not been involved in the marketing or sale of food additives for almost four
 years.
The Company stated that it was not aware of the investigation
 until the Department of Justice brought the matter to the Company's attention
 in early 1998. Once Pfizer became aware of this situation, it cooperated fully
 with the Department of Justice. The Company believes that this voluntary settlement
 is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.
Pfizer Inc is a research-based global pharmaceutical company
 that discovers, develops, manufactures and markets innovative medicines for
 humans and animals. The Company reported revenues of more than $13.5 billion
 in 1998 and expects to spend about $2.8 billion on research and development
 this year. In 1999, Pfizer celebrates its 150th anniversary.
