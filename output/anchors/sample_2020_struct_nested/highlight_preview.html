 Auto Callable Contingent Interest Notes Linked<br>
to the Least Performing of the Russell 2000 ® Index, the S&amp;P 500 ® Index and the EURO STOXX 50 ® <br>
Index due July 30, 2021 <br>
 Fully<br>
and Unconditionally Guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. <br>
 <br>
 ● The notes are designed for investors who seek a Contingent Interest Payment with respect to each monthly Interest Review Date<br>
for which the closing level of each of the Russell 2000 ® Index, the S&amp;P 500 ® Index and the EURO<br>
STOXX 50 ® Index, which we refer to as the Indices, is greater than or equal to 70.00% of its Initial Value, which<br>
we refer to as an Interest Barrier. <br>
 <br>
 ● The notes will be automatically called if the closing level of each Index on any quarterly Autocall Review Date is greater<br>
than or equal to its Initial Value. <br>
 <br>
 ● The earliest date on which an automatic call may be initiated is July 28, 2020. <br>
 <br>
 ● Investors in the notes should be willing to accept the risk of losing some or all of their principal and the risk that no Contingent<br>
Interest Payment may be made with respect to some or all Interest Review Dates. <br>
 <br>
 ● Investors should also be willing to forgo fixed interest and dividend payments, in exchange for the opportunity to receive<br>
Contingent Interest Payments. <br>
 <br>
 ● The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC, which we refer to as JPMorgan<br>
Financial, the payment on which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Any payment on the notes<br>
is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Financial, as issuer of the notes, and the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., as<br>
guarantor of the notes. <br>
 <br>
 ● Payments on the notes are not linked to a basket composed of the Indices. Payments on the notes are linked to the performance<br>
of each of the Indices individually, as described below. <br>
 <br>
 ● Minimum denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof <br>
 <br>
 ● The notes are expected to price on or about January 28, 2020 and are expected to settle on or about January 31, 2020. <br>

Hypothetical<br>
Payout Examples<br>
The following examples illustrate payments on<br>
the notes linked to three hypothetical Indices, assuming a range of performances for the hypothetical Least Performing Index on<br>
the Interest Review Dates and the Autocall Review Dates. Each hypothetical payment set forth below assumes that the closing<br>
level of each Index that is not the Least Performing Index on (i) each Autocall Review Date is greater than or equal to its Initial<br>
Value and (ii) on each Interest Review Date is greater than or equal to its Interest Barrier (and therefore its Trigger Value).<br>
In addition, the hypothetical payments set forth<br>
below assume the following:<br>

the Pricing Date and will be provided in the pricing supplement. For historical data regarding the actual closing levels of each<br>
Index , please see the historical information set forth under “The Indices” in this pricing supplement.<br>
Each hypothetical payment set forth below is for<br>

Because the closing level of each Index on the<br>
first Autocall Review Date, which is also the sixth Interest Review Date, is greater than or equal to its Initial Value, the notes<br>
will be automatically called for a cash payment, for each $1,000 principal amount note, of $1,005.4167 (or $1,000 plus the<br>
Contingent Interest Payment applicable to the sixth Interest Review Date), payable on the applicable Call Settlement Date. When<br>
added to the Contingent Interest Payments received with respect to the prior Interest Review Dates, the total amount paid, for<br>
each $1,000 principal amount note, is $1,032.50. No further payments will be made on the notes.<br>

Because the notes have not been automatically<br>

to obligations of our affiliates to make payments under loans made by us or other intercompany agreements. As a result, we are<br>
dependent upon payments from our affiliates to meet our obligations under the notes. If these affiliates do not make payments to<br>
us and we fail to make payments on the notes, you may have to seek payment under the related guarantee by JPMorgan Chase &amp;<br>
Co., and that guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase &amp;<br>
Co.<br>

income instruments of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which<br>
may prove to be incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use<br>
of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any<br>

Tax<br>
Treatment<br>
You should review carefully the section entitled<br>
“Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” in the accompanying product supplement no. 4-I. In determining our<br>
reporting responsibilities we intend to treat (i) the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with<br>
associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Interest Payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled<br>
“Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences — Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders — Notes Treated as Prepaid<br>
Forward Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying product supplement. We expect to ask our special<br>
tax counsel to advise us that this is a reasonable treatment, although there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a<br>
court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be materially affected. In addition,<br>
in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward<br>
contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments<br>
to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character<br>
of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property<br>
to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any<br>
Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences<br>
of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. The discussions above and in the accompanying product supplement<br>
do not address the consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code. You should<br>
consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative<br>
treatments and the issues presented by the notice described above.<br>
Non-U.S. Holders — Tax Considerations .<br>
The U.S. federal income tax treatment of Contingent Interest Payments is uncertain, and although we believe it is reasonable to<br>
take a position that Contingent Interest Payments are not subject to U.S. withholding tax (at least if an applicable Form W-8 is<br>
provided), a withholding agent may nonetheless withhold on these payments (generally at a rate of 30%, subject to the possible<br>
reduction of that rate under an applicable income tax treaty), unless income from your notes is effectively connected with your<br>
conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if an applicable treaty so requires, attributable to a permanent establishment<br>
in the United States). If you are not a United States person, you are urged to consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal<br>
income tax consequences of an investment in the notes in light of your particular circumstances.<br>
Section 871(m) of the Code and Treasury regulations<br>
promulgated thereunder (“Section 871(m)”) generally impose a 30% withholding tax (unless an income tax treaty applies)<br>
on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to Non-U.S. Holders with respect to certain financial instruments linked to U.S. equities<br>
or indices that include U.S. equities. Section 871(m) provides certain exceptions to this withholding regime, including for instruments<br>
linked to certain broad-based indices that meet requirements set forth in the applicable Treasury regulations (such an index, a<br>
“Qualified Index”). Additionally, a recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued<br>
prior to January 1, 2023 that do not have a delta of one with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends<br>
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on certain determinations made by us, we<br>
expect that Section 871(m) will not apply to the notes with regard to Non-U.S. Holders. Our determination is not binding on the<br>
IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular<br>
circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further<br>
information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the notes. You<br>
should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the notes.<br>
FATCA . Withholding under legislation commonly<br>
referred to as “FATCA” could apply to payments with respect to the notes that are treated as U.S.-source “fixed<br>
or determinable annual or periodical” income (“FDAP Income”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes (such as interest,<br>
if the notes are recharacterized, in whole or in part, as debt instruments, or Contingent Interest Payments if they are otherwise<br>
treated as FDAP Income). If the notes are recharacterized, in whole or in part, as debt instruments, withholding could also apply<br>
to payments of gross proceeds of a taxable disposition, including an early redemption or redemption at maturity, although under<br>
recently proposed regulations (the preamble to which specifies that taxpayers are permitted to rely on them pending finalization),<br>
no withholding will apply to payments of gross proceeds (other than any amount treated as FDAP Income). You should consult your<br>
tax adviser regarding the potential application of FATCA to the notes.<br>
In the event of any withholding on the notes,<br>
we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.<br>

The<br>
Estimated Value of the Notes<br>
The estimated value of the notes set forth on<br>
the cover of this pricing supplement is equal to the sum of the values of the following hypothetical components: (1) a fixed-income<br>
debt component with the same maturity as the notes, valued using the internal funding rate described below, and (2) the derivative<br>
or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes. The estimated value of the notes does not represent a minimum price<br>
at which JPMS would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The internal funding rate<br>
used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding rate for vanilla fixed<br>
income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may be based on,<br>
among other things, our and our affiliates’ view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational<br>
and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments<br>
of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be<br>
incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an internal<br>
funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market<br>
prices of the notes. For additional information, see “Selected Risk Considerations — The Estimated Value of the Notes<br>
Is Derived by Reference to an Internal Funding Rate” in this pricing supplement.<br>
The value of the derivative or derivatives underlying<br>
the economic terms of the notes is derived from internal pricing models of our affiliates. These models are dependent on inputs<br>
such as the traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on various other inputs, some of which are market-observable,<br>
and which can include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors, as well as assumptions about future market<br>
events and/or environments. Accordingly, the estimated value of the notes is determined when the terms of the notes are set based<br>
on market conditions and other relevant factors and assumptions existing at that time.<br>
The estimated value of the notes does not represent<br>
future values of the notes and may differ from others’ estimates. Different pricing models and assumptions could provide<br>
valuations for the notes that are greater than or less than the estimated value of the notes. In addition, market conditions and<br>
other relevant factors in the future may change, and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect. On future dates, the value of the<br>
notes could change significantly based on, among other things, changes in market conditions, our or JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s<br>
creditworthiness, interest rate movements and other relevant factors, which may impact the price, if any, at which JPMS would be<br>
willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions.<br>
The estimated value of the notes will be lower<br>
than the original issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included<br>
in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated<br>
dealers, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations<br>
under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. Because hedging our obligations entails risk<br>
and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control, this hedging may result in a profit that is more or less than expected,<br>
or it may result in a loss. A portion of the profits, if any, realized in hedging our obligations under the notes may be allowed<br>
to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, and we or one or more of our affiliates will retain any remaining hedging profits.<br>
See “Selected Risk Considerations — The Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Lower Than the Original Issue Price (Price<br>
to Public) of the Notes” in this pricing supplement.<br>
Secondary<br>
Market Prices of the Notes<br>
For information about factors that will impact<br>
any secondary market prices of the notes, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market<br>
Prices of the Notes — Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors” in<br>
the accompanying product supplement. In addition, we generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price<br>
of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will<br>
decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. These costs can include selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if<br>
any, and, in some circumstances, estimated hedging costs and our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances.<br>
This initial predetermined time period is intended to be the shorter of six months and one-half of the stated term of the notes.<br>
The length of any such initial period reflects the structure of the notes, whether our affiliates expect to earn a profit in connection<br>
with our hedging activities, the estimated costs of hedging the notes and when these costs are incurred, as determined by our affiliates.<br>
See “Selected Risk Considerations — The Value of the Notes as Published by JPMS (and Which May Be Reflected on Customer<br>
Account Statements) May Be Higher Than the Then-Current Estimated Value of the Notes for a Limited Time Period” in this pricing<br>
supplement.<br>

Supplemental<br>
Use of Proceeds<br>
The notes are offered to meet investor demand<br>
for products that reflect the risk-return profile and market exposure provided by the notes. See “How the Notes Work”<br>
and “Hypothetical Payout Examples” in this pricing supplement for an illustration of the risk-return profile of the<br>
notes and “The Indices” in this pricing supplement for a description of the market exposure provided by the notes.<br>
The original issue price of the notes is equal<br>
to the estimated value of the notes plus the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, plus<br>
(minus) the projected profits (losses) that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations<br>
under the notes, plus the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes.<br>
Supplemental<br>
Plan of Distribution<br>
We expect that delivery of the notes will be made<br>
against payment for the notes on or about the Original Issue Date set forth on the front cover of this pricing supplement, which<br>
will be the third business day following the Pricing Date of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+3”).<br>
Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to<br>
settle in two business days, unless the parties to that trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade<br>
notes on any date prior to two business days before delivery will be required to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time<br>
of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisors.<br>
Additional<br>
Terms Specific to the Notes<br>
You may revoke your offer to purchase the notes<br>
at any time prior to the time at which we accept such offer by notifying the applicable agent. We reserve the right to change the<br>
terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the notes prior to their issuance. In the event of any changes to the terms of the notes,<br>
we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject<br>
such changes, in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.<br>
You should read this pricing supplement together<br>
with the accompanying prospectus, as supplemented by the accompanying prospectus supplement relating to our Series A medium-term<br>
notes of which these notes are a part, and the more detailed information contained in the accompanying product supplement and the<br>
accompanying underlying supplement. This pricing supplement, together with the documents listed below, contains the terms of the<br>
notes and supersedes all other prior or contemporaneous oral statements as well as any other written materials including preliminary<br>
or indicative pricing terms, correspondence, trade ideas, structures for implementation, sample structures, fact sheets, brochures<br>
or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth in the “Risk<br>
Factors” sections of the accompanying product supplement and the accompanying underlying supplement, as the notes involve<br>
risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other<br>
advisers before you invest in the notes.<br>
