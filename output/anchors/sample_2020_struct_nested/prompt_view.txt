⟦s000048⟧ The hypothetical Initial Value of the Least Performing Index of 100.
⟦s000049⟧ 00 has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual Initial Value of any Index.
⟦s000050⟧ The actual Initial Value of each Index will be the closing level of that Index on the Pricing Date and will be provided in the pricing supplement.
⟦s000051⟧ For historical data regarding the actual closing levels of each Index , please see the historical information set forth under “The Indices” in this pricing supplement.

⟦s000196⟧ The Estimated Value of the Notes
⟦s000197⟧ The estimated value of the notes set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement is equal to the sum of the values of the following hypothetical components: (1) a fixed-income debt component with the same maturity as the notes, valued using the internal funding rate described below, and (2) the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes.
⟦s000198⟧ The estimated value of the notes does not represent a minimum price at which JPMS would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time.
⟦s000199⟧ The internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or its affiliates.
⟦s000200⟧ Any difference may be based on, among other things, our and our affiliates’ view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of JPMorgan Chase & Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes.
⟦s000201⟧ The use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes.
⟦s000202⟧ For additional information, see “Selected Risk Considerations — The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Derived by Reference to an Internal Funding Rate” in this pricing supplement.
⟦s000203⟧ The value of the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes is derived from internal pricing models of our affiliates.
⟦s000204⟧ These models are dependent on inputs such as the traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on various other inputs, some of which are market-observable, and which can include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors, as well as assumptions about future market events and/or environments.
⟦s000205⟧ Accordingly, the estimated value of the notes is determined when the terms of the notes are set based on market conditions and other relevant factors and assumptions existing at that time.
⟦s000206⟧ The estimated value of the notes does not represent future values of the notes and may differ from others’ estimates.
⟦s000207⟧ Different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the notes that are greater than or less than the estimated value of the notes.
⟦s000208⟧ In addition, market conditions and other relevant factors in the future may change, and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect.
⟦s000209⟧ On future dates, the value of the notes could change significantly based on, among other things, changes in market conditions, our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s creditworthiness, interest rate movements and other relevant factors, which may impact the price, if any, at which JPMS would be willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions.
⟦s000210⟧ The estimated value of the notes will be lower than the original issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes.
⟦s000211⟧ These costs include the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes.
⟦s000212⟧ Because hedging our obligations entails risk and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control, this hedging may result in a profit that is more or less than expected, or it may result in a loss.
⟦s000213⟧ A portion of the profits, if any, realized in hedging our obligations under the notes may be allowed to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, and we or one or more of our affiliates will retain any remaining hedging profits.
⟦s000214⟧ See “Selected Risk Considerations — The Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Lower Than the Original Issue Price (Price to Public) of the Notes” in this pricing supplement.
⟦s000215⟧ Secondary Market Prices of the Notes
⟦s000216⟧ For information about factors that will impact any secondary market prices of the notes, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes — Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors” in the accompanying product supplement.
⟦s000217⟧ In addition, we generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period.
⟦s000218⟧ These costs can include selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, and, in some circumstances, estimated hedging costs and our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances.
⟦s000219⟧ This initial predetermined time period is intended to be the shorter of six months and one-half of the stated term of the notes.
⟦s000220⟧ The length of any such initial period reflects the structure of the notes, whether our affiliates expect to earn a profit in connection with our hedging activities, the estimated costs of hedging the notes and when these costs are incurred, as determined by our affiliates.

⟦s000232⟧ Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes on any date prior to two business days before delivery will be required to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisors.
⟦s000233⟧ Additional Terms Specific to the Notes
⟦s000234⟧ You may revoke your offer to purchase the notes at any time prior to the time at which we accept such offer by notifying the applicable agent.
⟦s000235⟧ We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the notes prior to their issuance.
⟦s000236⟧ In the event of any changes to the terms of the notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase.
⟦s000237⟧ You may also choose to reject such changes, in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.
⟦s000238⟧ You should read this pricing supplement together with the accompanying prospectus, as supplemented by the accompanying prospectus supplement relating to our Series A medium-term notes of which these notes are a part, and the more detailed information contained in the accompanying product supplement and the accompanying underlying supplement.
⟦s000239⟧ This pricing supplement, together with the documents listed below, contains the terms of the notes and supersedes all other prior or contemporaneous oral statements as well as any other written materials including preliminary or indicative pricing terms, correspondence, trade ideas, structures for implementation, sample structures, fact sheets, brochures or other educational materials of ours.
⟦s000240⟧ You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth in the “Risk Factors” sections of the accompanying product supplement and the accompanying underlying supplement, as the notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities.
⟦s000241⟧ We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisers before you invest in the notes.
