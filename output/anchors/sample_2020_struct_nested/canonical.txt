than or equal to its Initial Value. 
 
 ● The earliest date on which an automatic call may be initiated is July 28, 2020.

Contingent Interest Payments.

is subject to the credit risk of JPMorgan Financial, as issuer of the notes, and the credit risk of JPMorgan Chase & Co., as

Hypothetical
Payout Examples
The following examples illustrate payments on
the notes linked to three hypothetical Indices, assuming a range of performances for the hypothetical Least Performing Index on
the Interest Review Dates and the Autocall Review Dates. Each hypothetical payment set forth below assumes that the closing
level of each Index that is not the Least Performing Index on (i) each Autocall Review Date is greater than or equal to its Initial
Value and (ii) on each Interest Review Date is greater than or equal to its Interest Barrier (and therefore its Trigger Value).
In addition, the hypothetical payments set forth
below assume the following:
Table 5 Row 1 Col 2 | Column Header: ●

a Contingent Interest Rate of 6.50% per annum (payable at a rate of 0.54167% per month).
The hypothetical Initial Value of the Least
Performing Index of 100.00 has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual Initial
Value of any Index.
The actual Initial Value of each Index 
will be the closing level of that Index on
the Pricing Date and will be provided in the pricing supplement. For historical data regarding the actual closing levels of each
Index , please see the historical information set forth under “The Indices” in this pricing supplement.
Each hypothetical payment set forth below is for
illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual payment applicable to a purchaser of the notes. The numbers appearing in the
following examples have been rounded for ease of analysis.

Because the closing level of each Index on the
first Autocall Review Date, which is also the sixth Interest Review Date, is greater than or equal to its Initial Value, the notes
will be automatically called for a cash payment, for each $1,000 principal amount note, of $1,005.4167 (or $1,000 plus the
Contingent Interest Payment applicable to the sixth Interest Review Date), payable on the applicable Call Settlement Date. When
added to the Contingent Interest Payments received with respect to the prior Interest Review Dates, the total amount paid, for
each $1,000 principal amount note, is $1,032.50. No further payments will be made on the notes.

has occurred and the Least Performing Index Return is -40.00%, the payment at maturity will be $600.00 per $1,000 principal amount
note, calculated as follows:
$1,000 + [$1,000 × (-40.00%)] = $600.00
The hypothetical returns and hypothetical payments
on the notes shown above apply only if you hold the notes for their entire term or until automatically called. These hypotheticals

Tax
Treatment
You should review carefully the section entitled
“Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” in the accompanying product supplement no. 4-I. In determining our
reporting responsibilities we intend to treat (i) the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with
associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Interest Payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled
“Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences — Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders — Notes Treated as Prepaid
Forward Contracts with Associated Contingent Coupons” in the accompanying product supplement. We expect to ask our special
tax counsel to advise us that this is a reasonable treatment, although there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a
court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be materially affected. In addition,
in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward
contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments
to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character
of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property
to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any
Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences
of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. The discussions above and in the accompanying product supplement
do not address the consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code. You should
consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative
treatments and the issues presented by the notice described above.
Non-U.S. Holders — Tax Considerations .
The U.S. federal income tax treatment of Contingent Interest Payments is uncertain, and although we believe it is reasonable to
take a position that Contingent Interest Payments are not subject to U.S. withholding tax (at least if an applicable Form W-8 is
provided), a withholding agent may nonetheless withhold on these payments (generally at a rate of 30%, subject to the possible
reduction of that rate under an applicable income tax treaty), unless income from your notes is effectively connected with your
conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if an applicable treaty so requires, attributable to a permanent establishment
in the United States). If you are not a United States person, you are urged to consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of an investment in the notes in light of your particular circumstances.
Section 871(m) of the Code and Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder (“Section 871(m)”) generally impose a 30% withholding tax (unless an income tax treaty applies)
on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to Non-U.S. Holders with respect to certain financial instruments linked to U.S. equities
or indices that include U.S. equities. Section 871(m) provides certain exceptions to this withholding regime, including for instruments
linked to certain broad-based indices that meet requirements set forth in the applicable Treasury regulations (such an index, a
“Qualified Index”). Additionally, a recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued
prior to January 1, 2023 that do not have a delta of one with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends
for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on certain determinations made by us, we
expect that Section 871(m) will not apply to the notes with regard to Non-U.S. Holders. Our determination is not binding on the
IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular
circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further
information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the notes. You
should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the notes.
FATCA . Withholding under legislation commonly
referred to as “FATCA” could apply to payments with respect to the notes that are treated as U.S.-source “fixed
or determinable annual or periodical” income (“FDAP Income”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes (such as interest,
if the notes are recharacterized, in whole or in part, as debt instruments, or Contingent Interest Payments if they are otherwise
treated as FDAP Income). If the notes are recharacterized, in whole or in part, as debt instruments, withholding could also apply
to payments of gross proceeds of a taxable disposition, including an early redemption or redemption at maturity, although under
recently proposed regulations (the preamble to which specifies that taxpayers are permitted to rely on them pending finalization),
no withholding will apply to payments of gross proceeds (other than any amount treated as FDAP Income). You should consult your
tax adviser regarding the potential application of FATCA to the notes.
In the event of any withholding on the notes,
we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.

The
Estimated Value of the Notes
The estimated value of the notes set forth on
the cover of this pricing supplement is equal to the sum of the values of the following hypothetical components: (1) a fixed-income
debt component with the same maturity as the notes, valued using the internal funding rate described below, and (2) the derivative
or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes. The estimated value of the notes does not represent a minimum price
at which JPMS would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The internal funding rate
used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding rate for vanilla fixed
income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may be based on,
among other things, our and our affiliates’ view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational
and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments
of JPMorgan Chase & Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be
incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an internal
funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market
prices of the notes. For additional information, see “Selected Risk Considerations — The Estimated Value of the Notes
Is Derived by Reference to an Internal Funding Rate” in this pricing supplement.
The value of the derivative or derivatives underlying
the economic terms of the notes is derived from internal pricing models of our affiliates. These models are dependent on inputs
such as the traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on various other inputs, some of which are market-observable,
and which can include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors, as well as assumptions about future market
events and/or environments. Accordingly, the estimated value of the notes is determined when the terms of the notes are set based
on market conditions and other relevant factors and assumptions existing at that time.
The estimated value of the notes does not represent
future values of the notes and may differ from others’ estimates. Different pricing models and assumptions could provide
valuations for the notes that are greater than or less than the estimated value of the notes. In addition, market conditions and
other relevant factors in the future may change, and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect. On future dates, the value of the
notes could change significantly based on, among other things, changes in market conditions, our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
creditworthiness, interest rate movements and other relevant factors, which may impact the price, if any, at which JPMS would be
willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions.
The estimated value of the notes will be lower
than the original issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included
in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated
dealers, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations
under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. Because hedging our obligations entails risk
and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control, this hedging may result in a profit that is more or less than expected,
or it may result in a loss. A portion of the profits, if any, realized in hedging our obligations under the notes may be allowed
to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, and we or one or more of our affiliates will retain any remaining hedging profits.
See “Selected Risk Considerations — The Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Lower Than the Original Issue Price (Price
to Public) of the Notes” in this pricing supplement.
Secondary
Market Prices of the Notes
For information about factors that will impact
any secondary market prices of the notes, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market
Prices of the Notes — Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors” in
the accompanying product supplement. In addition, we generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price
of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will
decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. These costs can include selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if
any, and, in some circumstances, estimated hedging costs and our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances.
This initial predetermined time period is intended to be the shorter of six months and one-half of the stated term of the notes.
The length of any such initial period reflects the structure of the notes, whether our affiliates expect to earn a profit in connection
with our hedging activities, the estimated costs of hedging the notes and when these costs are incurred, as determined by our affiliates.
See “Selected Risk Considerations — The Value of the Notes as Published by JPMS (and Which May Be Reflected on Customer
Account Statements) May Be Higher Than the Then-Current Estimated Value of the Notes for a Limited Time Period” in this pricing
supplement.

Supplemental
Use of Proceeds
The notes are offered to meet investor demand
for products that reflect the risk-return profile and market exposure provided by the notes. See “How the Notes Work”
and “Hypothetical Payout Examples” in this pricing supplement for an illustration of the risk-return profile of the
notes and “The Indices” in this pricing supplement for a description of the market exposure provided by the notes.
The original issue price of the notes is equal
to the estimated value of the notes plus the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, plus
(minus) the projected profits (losses) that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations
under the notes, plus the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes.
Supplemental
Plan of Distribution
We expect that delivery of the notes will be made
against payment for the notes on or about the Original Issue Date set forth on the front cover of this pricing supplement, which
will be the third business day following the Pricing Date of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+3”).
Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in two business days, unless the parties to that trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade
notes on any date prior to two business days before delivery will be required to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time
of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisors.
Additional
Terms Specific to the Notes
You may revoke your offer to purchase the notes
at any time prior to the time at which we accept such offer by notifying the applicable agent. We reserve the right to change the
terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the notes prior to their issuance. In the event of any changes to the terms of the notes,
we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject
such changes, in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.
