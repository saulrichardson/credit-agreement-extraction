You map claims to anchor IDs from the supplied source text. Anchors appear as ⟦s000127⟧ or ⟦t10r02c03⟧ before their text.
For the claim below, return JSON:
{
  "status": "supported" | "unsupported",
  "anchors": ["s000127", ...],
  "rationale": "short explanation"
}
Rules:
- Only cite anchors that contain the exact supporting language.
- Use "unsupported" with ["N/A"] if no anchor supports the claim.
