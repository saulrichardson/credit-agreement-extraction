You are writing production-grade Python that encodes the pricing mechanics described below. Treat the text as authoritative; do not invent terms.

Requirements:
- Declare all borrower-specific inputs (Total Leverage Ratio, Base Rate, SOFR, commitment amounts, etc.) as global variables at the top. Use placeholder values so a reader knows what to supply.
- Implement helper functions for each major component:
  * `determine_applicable_margin(total_leverage_ratio)` → returns Base Rate and SOFR margins based on the tier table.
  * `adjust_margin_for_reporting(default_margin, delivered_financials)` → applies the “Tier I by default until financials delivered” rule.
  * Additional helpers for prepayment premiums, benchmark adjustments, or other pricing logic described.
- Provide a single `compute_pricing_summary(delivered_financials: bool) -> dict` tying everything together. When called, it should compute:
  * Current Applicable Margin (Base Rate & SOFR)
  * Whether Tier I is presumed
  * Prepayment premium percentages applicable today
- Include docstrings for each helper. Raise exceptions when required inputs are missing. No heuristics beyond the supplied text.
- Use only the information provided. Mark any missing concepts with TODOs.
