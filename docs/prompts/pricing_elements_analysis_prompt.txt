Given the following excerpt from a term loan credit agreement, describe every performance-pricing construct you find. Provide a free-form explanation organized in clearly labeled sections. For each construct, cite the relevant language in prose (no JSON or anchor IDs) and explain how it affects borrower pricing.

Focus on:
- Leverage-based margin tiers (Applicable Margin table, reporting-based adjustments)
- Benchmark fallback/reset mechanics (Term SOFR replacement, Benchmark Transition Events)
- Timing-based prepayment premiums or fees
- Default rate and other clauses that change borrower costs (e.g., increased costs, illegality provisions)

Call out any missing data or ambiguities in a closing “Notes” section.
