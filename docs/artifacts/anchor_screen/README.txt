LLM anchor screening outputs generated by scripts/pricing_anchor_llm.py (and similar tools).
Each file is named <input_stem>_pricing_anchors.json and contains:
  - anchors: anchor IDs returned by the model
  - has_performance_pricing: boolean flag

Re-run the CLI with --output to override this location.
