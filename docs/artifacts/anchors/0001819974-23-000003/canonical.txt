(b) If, at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date (or at any time before or after the Closing Date with respect to (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, regulations, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith, or (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in each case for purposes of this clause (y) pursuant to Basel III, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued), (i) any change in any existing law, regulation, treaty or directive or in the interpretation or application thereof, (ii) any new law, regulation, treaty or directive enacted or application thereof, or (iii) compliance by Agent or any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency (A) subjects Agent or any Lender to Taxes (other than (1) Indemnified Taxes, (2) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (3) Other Connection Taxes that are imposed on or measured by net income (however denominated) or that are franchise Taxes or branch profits Taxes), or (B) imposes on Agent or any Lender any other condition or increased cost in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby or participations therein, and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Agent or any Lender of making or continuing any Loan or Letter of Credit or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder or under any other Loan Documents, then, in any such case, Borrowers shall promptly and jointly and severally pay to Agent or such Lender, when notified to do so by Agent or such Lender (together with a certificate provided by Agent or such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount necessary to compensate such Lender or Agent), any additional amounts necessary to compensate Agent or such Lender, on an after tax basis, for such additional cost or reduced amount as determined by Agent or such Lender; provided that Borrowers shall not be required to compensate Agent or any Lender for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days before the date that Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, notifies Borrowers of such change giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if such change giving rise to such increased costs is retroactive, then the 180 day period referred to above shall be extended to indicate the period of retroactive effect thereof. Each such notice of additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 1.9(b) submitted by Agent or any Lender to Borrowing Agent shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding for all purposes.
(c) This Section 1.9 shall remain operative even after the Termination Date and shall survive the payment in full of all of the Obligations.

1.10 Reversal of Payments. To the extent that any payment or payments made to or received by Agent or any Lender pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, or required to be repaid to any trustee, receiver or other Person under any state, federal or other bankruptcy or other such applicable law, then, to the extent thereof, such amounts (and all Liens, rights and remedies therefore) shall be revived as Obligations (secured by all such Liens) and continue in full force and effect under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents as if such payment or payments had not been received by Agent or such Lender. This Section 1.10 shall remain operative even after the Termination Date and shall survive the payment in full of all of the Obligations
1.11 Independent Obligations. The Revolving Loans shall be made by the Lenders contemporaneously and in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares. It is understood that (a) no Lender shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make the Revolving Loans (or other extension of credit) hereunder, nor shall any commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligations hereunder, and (b) no failure by any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder shall excuse any other Lender from its obligations hereunder.
1.12 Revolving Loans by Agent and Settlement Among Lenders.
(a) Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, shall disburse all Loans and other advances to the Borrowing Agent and shall handle all collections of Collateral and repayment of all Obligations. If Agent elects to require that any Lender make funds available to Agent, prior to a disbursement by Agent to Borrowing Agent, Agent shall advise each Lender by telephone, facsimile or e-mail of the amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loan requested by Borrowers no later than noon (Eastern time) on the date of funding of such Revolving Loan, and each such Lender shall pay Agent on such date such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such requested Revolving Loan, in same day funds, by wire transfer to Agent’s Account, or such other account as may be identified in writing by Agent to Lenders from time to time; provided, that no Lender shall have an obligation to make any Revolving Loan, if (i) one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 1.6 will not be satisfied on the requested date for the applicable Revolving Loan unless such condition has been waived hereof, or (ii) the requested Revolving Loan would exceed the Excess Availability on such requested date for the applicable Revolving Loan. It is understood that for purposes of advances to the Borrowing Agent and for purposes of this Section 1.12, unless Agent has made the election referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, Agent will be using the funds of Agent, and pending settlement, all interest accruing on such advances shall be payable to Agent
(b) Unless Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to any advance to the Borrowing Agent that such Lender will not make the amount which would constitute its Pro Rata Share of the borrowing on such date available to Agent, Agent may assume that such Lender shall make such amount available to Agent on a Settlement Date, and in reliance upon such assumption, Agent may make available to the Borrowing Agent a corresponding amount. A certificate of Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this subsection shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such borrowing is not in fact made available to Agent by such Lender on the Settlement Date, Agent shall be entitled to recover from the Borrowers, on demand, such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such borrowing, together with interest thereon (for the account of Agent) at the rate per annum applicable to such borrowing, without prejudice to any rights which Agent may have against such Lender under Section 10.19 hereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to obligate Agent to make available to the Borrowers the full amount of a requested advance when Agent has any notice (written or otherwise) that any of the Lenders will not advance its Pro Rata Share thereof.
(c) On each Settlement Date, Agent and the Lenders shall each remit to the other, in immediately available funds, all amounts necessary so as to ensure that, as of the Settlement Date, the Lenders shall have advanced their respective Pro Rata Share of all outstanding Revolving Loans. Each Lender’s obligation to make the settlements pursuant to this Section 1.12(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (v) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which any such Lender or Borrower may have against Agent, the other the Borrowers, any other Lender or any other person, (w) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or Event of Default, (x) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrowers, or
-7-
any of them, (y) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrowers, or any of them, or any other Lender or (z) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.
2. INTEREST AND FEES; LOAN ACCOUNT.
1.1 Interest.
(a) All Loans and other monetary Obligations shall bear interest at the interest rate(s) set forth in Section 3 of Schedule A, and accrued interest shall be payable (a) on the first day of each month in arrears, (b) upon a prepayment of such Loan in accordance with Section 1.8, and (c) on the Maturity Date; provided , that after the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, all Loans and other monetary Obligations shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to two (2) percentage points in excess of the rate otherwise applicable thereto (the “ Default Rate ”), and all such interest shall be payable on demand. Changes in the interest rate shall be effective as of the date of any change in the Base Rate or Term SOFR, as applicable. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Loans shall bear interest at Term SOFR or, following issuance by Borrowing Agent of the related Interest Rate Election Notice or under the circumstances set forth in Section 2.1(d), the Base Rate; provided, that (i) Borrowers may, upon five (5) Business Days’ written notice to Agent, elect that all outstanding Loans and Obligations shall bear interest at Term SOFR, or if Borrowers have previously elected that all Loans shall bear interest at Term SOFR, Borrowers may, upon five (5) Business Days’ written notice to Agent, elect that all outstanding Loans and Obligations shall bear interest at the Base Rate (the notices described in this clause (i) are referred to herein as an “Interest Rate Election Notice”), (ii) Borrowers may not deliver more than two Interest Rate Election Notices in any fiscal year, and (iii) any election for all Loans and Obligations to bear interest at Term SOFR (or the Base Rate) shall only be effective upon the first day of the month after delivery of an Interest Rate Election Notice.
(b) Any Term SOFR Loans shall bear interest at Term SOFR for a period commencing on the first day of a calendar month and ending on the last day of such calendar month (the “ Interest Period ”) unless and until converted to Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate in accordance with Section 2.1(a), 2.1(c), Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.1(e) below.
(c) Term SOFR may be adjusted by Agent on a prospective basis (provided that Agent is making such adjustment for all similarly situated borrowers) to take into account any increased costs due to changes in applicable law occurring subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable interest period, including changes in tax laws (except changes of general applicability in corporate income tax laws) and changes in the reserve requirements imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor), which additional or increased costs would increase the cost of maintaining loans under this Agreement bearing interest based upon Term SOFR. In any such event, Agent shall give Borrowers notice of such a determination and adjustment and, upon its receipt of the notice from Agent, Borrowers may, by notice to Agent (A) require Agent to furnish to Borrowers a statement setting forth the basis for adjusting Term SOFR and the method for determining the amount of such adjustment or (B) repay the portion of the Loans bearing interest based upon Term SOFR with respect to which such adjustment is made. Upon any such repayment, Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so repaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to the Fee Letter.
(d) If Agent determines that any law has made it unlawful, or that any governmental authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for Agent or its applicable lending office to maintain any Loan with interest determined by reference to Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon Term SOFR, then, upon notice thereof by Agent to Borrowers, any obligation of Agent to maintain any Term SOFR Loan shall be suspended until Agent notifies Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrowers shall, upon demand from Agent, convert the Term SOFR Loans to loans bearing interest at the Base Rate, either on the last day of the applicable Interest Period, if Agent may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if Agent may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans until Agent determines that it is no longer illegal for Agent to determine or charge interest rates based upon Term SOFR. Upon any such conversion, Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to the Fee Letter
-8-
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, but without limiting Section 2.1(d) above, if Agent or the Required Lenders determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error), that:
(i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining Term SOFR for any interest period because Term SOFR is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or
(ii) the SOFR Administrator or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which Term SOFR shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans; provided, that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to Lender, that will continue to provide Term SOFR after such specific date (such specific date, the “Scheduled Unavailability Date”); or
(iii) syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language similar to that contained in this Section 2.1(e), are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace Term SOFR;
then, reasonably promptly after such determination by Agent or Required Lenders, Agent may amend this Agreement to replace Term SOFR with (A) the Base Rate, or (B) if administratively feasible and acceptable to Agent (and if no Event of Default shall be continuing, after consultation with Borrower) to (1) one or more other SOFR-Based Rates or (2) another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such alternative benchmarks and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such benchmarks (such as the margin applicable thereto) which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated (the “ Adjustment ”; and any such proposed rate, a “ Term SOFR Successor Rate ”). Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to Lenders. Such Term SOFR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided, that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for Agent, such Term SOFR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by Agent. If no Term SOFR Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause (e)(i) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable), Agent will promptly so notify Borrowers. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Period). Upon receipt of such notice, Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of Term SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or interest period) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate in the amount specified therein. In connection with the implementation of a Term SOFR Successor Rate, Agent will have the right to make Term SOFR Successor Rate Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Term SOFR Successor Rate Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.
Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, Lender is not required actually to match fund any Obligation as to which interest accrues based on Term SOFR.
1.2 Fees. Borrowers shall jointly and severally pay to Agent, for its own benefit or the benefit of Lenders as indicated in the Fee Letter, the fees set forth in the Fee Letter, in each case on the dates set forth therein, which fees are in addition to all fees and other sums payable by Borrowers or any other Person to Agent or any Lender under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document, and, in each case are not refundable once paid.
1.3 Computation of Interest and Fees. All interest and fees shall be calculated daily on the outstanding monetary Obligations based on the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.
-9-
1.4 Loan Account; Monthly Accountings. Agent shall maintain a loan account for Borrowers reflecting all outstanding Loans and the Letters of Credit Balance, along with interest accrued thereon and such other items reflected therein (the “ Loan Account ”), and shall provide Borrowing Agent with a monthly accounting reflecting the activity in the Loan Account, viewable by Borrowing Agent on Passport 6.0. Each accounting shall be deemed correct, accurate and binding on Borrowers and an account stated (except for reverses and reapplications of payments made and corrections of errors discovered by Agent), unless Borrowing Agent notifies Agent in writing to the contrary within thirty (30) days after such account is rendered, describing the nature of any alleged errors or omissions. However, Agent’s failure to maintain the Loan Account or to provide any such accounting shall not affect the legality or binding nature of any of the Obligations. Interest, fees and other monetary Obligations due and owing under this Agreement (including fees and other amounts paid by Agent to issuers of Letters of Credit) may, in Agent’s discretion, be charged to the Loan Account, and will thereafter be deemed to be Revolving Loans and will bear interest at the same rate as other Revolving Loans.
1.5 Further Obligations; Maximum Lawful Rate. With respect to all monetary Obligations for which the interest rate is not otherwise specified herein (whether such Obligations arise hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or otherwise), such Obligations shall bear interest at the rate(s) in effect from time to time with respect to the applicable Loan to which such Obligations relate and shall be payable upon demand by Agent. In no event shall the interest charged with respect to any Loan or any other Obligation exceed the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or elsewhere, if at any time the rate of interest payable or other amounts hereunder or under any other Loan Document (the “ Stated Rate ”) would exceed the highest rate of interest or other amount permitted under any applicable law to be charged (the “ Maximum Lawful Rate ”), then for so long as the Maximum Lawful Rate would be so exceeded, the rate of interest and other amounts payable shall be equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate; provided , that if at any time thereafter the Stated Rate is less than the Maximum Lawful Rate, Borrowers shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, continue to pay interest and such other amounts at the Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total interest and other such amounts received is equal to the total interest and other such amounts which would have been received had the Stated Rate been (but for the operation of this provision) the interest rate payable or such other amounts payable. Thereafter, the interest rate and such other amounts payable shall be the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate again would exceed the Maximum Lawful Rate, in which event this provision shall again apply. In no event shall the total interest or other such amounts received by Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, exceed the amount which it could lawfully have received had the interest and other such amounts been calculated for the full term hereof at the Maximum Lawful Rate. If, notwithstanding the prior sentence, Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, has received interest or other such amounts hereunder in excess of the Maximum Lawful Rate, such excess amount shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Loans or to other Obligations (other than interest) payable hereunder, and if no such principal or other Obligations are then outstanding, such excess or part thereof remaining shall be paid to Borrowers. In computing interest payable with reference to the Maximum Lawful Rate applicable to any Lender, such interest shall be calculated at a daily rate equal to the Maximum Lawful Rate divided by the number of days in the year in which such calculation is made.
3. SECURITY INTEREST GRANT / POSSESSORY COLLATERAL / FURTHER ASSURANCES.
1.1 Grant of Security Interest. To secure the full payment and performance of all of the Obligations, each Loan Party hereby collaterally assigns to Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, and grants to Agent, for the benefit of Lenders, a continuing security interest in all property of such Loan Party, whether tangible or intangible, real or personal, now or hereafter owned, existing, acquired or arising and wherever now or hereafter located, and whether or not eligible for lending purposes, including: (a) all Accounts (whether or not Eligible Billed Accounts or Eligible Unbilled Accounts) and all Goods whose sale, lease or other disposition by such Loan Party has given rise to Accounts and have been returned to, or repossessed or stopped in transit by, such Loan Party; (b) all Chattel Paper (including Electronic Chattel Paper), Instruments, Documents, and General Intangibles (including all patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark applications, trade names, trade secrets, goodwill, copyrights, copyright applications, registrations, licenses, software, franchises, customer lists, tax refund claims, claims against carriers and shippers, guarantee claims, contracts rights, payment intangibles, security interests, security deposits and rights to indemnification); (c) all Inventory (whether or not Eligible Inventory); (d) all Goods (other than Inventory), including Equipment, Farm Products, Health-Care-Insurance Receivables, vehicles, and Fixtures; (e) all Investment Property, including, without limitation,

provided , that with respect to any such limitation described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (iii) (1) upon the request of Agent, such Loan Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any requisite consent for the creation of such Lien in favor of Lender on such property, (2) immediately upon the ineffectiveness, lapse or termination of any such restriction, the Collateral shall include, and such Loan Party shall be deemed to have granted a Lien on such property under the applicable Loan Documents as if such restriction had never been in effect;

(iv) any permit or license or any Contractual Obligation held or entered into by any Loan Party (A) that prohibits or requires the consent of any Person other than any Loan Party and its Affiliates which has not been obtained as a condition to the creation by such Loan Party of a Lien on any right, title or interest in such permit, license or Contractual Obligation or any Stock related thereto, (B) to the extent that any applicable law prohibits the creation of a Lien thereon, or (C) to the extent that creation by such Loan Party of a Lien thereon would result in the abandonment, invalidation or unenforceability of any material right of such Loan Party therein or cause a material breach or termination pursuant to the terms of, or a material default under, such permit, license or Contractual Obligation, but only, with respect to the prohibition in (A), (B) and (C), to the extent, and for as long as, such prohibition is not terminated or rendered unenforceable or otherwise deemed ineffective by the UCC or any other applicable law;

1.2 Guaranty of Payment. This Loan Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection. Each Guarantor waives any right to require Agent or any Lender to sue or otherwise take
-36-
action against any Borrower, any other Guarantor, or any other Person obligated for all or any part of the Obligations, or otherwise to enforce its payment against any Collateral securing all or any part of the Obligations.
1.3 No Discharge or Diminishment of Loan Guaranty .
(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are unconditional and absolute and not subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the payment in full in cash of all of the Obligations), including: (i) any claim of waiver, release, extension, renewal, settlement, surrender, alteration, or compromise of any of the Obligations, by operation of law or otherwise; (ii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any Borrower or any other Guarantor; (iii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting any Borrower or any other Guarantor, or their assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Borrower or any other Guarantor; or (iv) the existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which any Guarantor may have at any time against any Borrower, any other Guarantor, Agent, any Lender, or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or in any unrelated transactions.
(b) The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are not subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of any of the Obligations or otherwise, or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit payment by any Borrower or any other Guarantor, of the Obligations or any part thereof.
(c) Further, the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder are not discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by: (i) the failure of Agent or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy with respect to all or any part of the Obligations; (ii) any waiver or modification of or supplement to any provision of any agreement relating to the Obligations; (iii) any release, non-perfection, or invalidity of any indirect or direct security for all or any part of the Obligations or all or any part of any obligations of any Guarantor; (iv) any action or failure to act by Agent or any Lender with respect to any Collateral; or (v) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance of any of the Obligations, or any other circumstance, act, omission or delay that might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the payment in full in cash of all of the Obligations).
1.4 Defenses Waived. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor hereby waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Guarantor or the unenforceability of all or any part of the Obligations from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Guarantor, other than the payment in full in cash of all of the Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against any Borrower, or any other Person. Each Guarantor confirms that it is not a surety under any state law and shall not raise any such law as a defense to its obligations hereunder. Agent may, at its election, foreclose on any Collateral held by it by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such Collateral in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise act or fail to act with respect to any Collateral, compromise or adjust any part of the Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Borrower or any other Guarantor or exercise any other right or remedy available to it against any Borrower or any other Guarantor, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor under this Loan Guaranty except to the extent the Obligations have been fully and paid in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though that election may operate, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any Guarantor against any Borrower or any other Guarantor or any security.
1.5 Rights of Subrogation. No Guarantor will assert any right, claim or cause of action, including, without limitation, a claim of subrogation, contribution or indemnification that it has against any Borrower or any other Guarantor, or any Collateral, until the Termination Date.
-37-
1.6 Reinstatement; Stay of Acceleration. If at any time any payment of any portion of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of any Borrower or any other Person, or otherwise, each Guarantor’s obligations under this Loan Guaranty with respect to that payment shall be reinstated at such time as though the payment had not been made and whether or not Agent or any Lender is in possession of this Loan Guaranty. If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of any agreement relating to the Obligations shall nonetheless be payable by the Loan Parties forthwith on demand by Agent. This Section 8.6 shall remain operative even after the Termination Date and shall survive the payment in full of all of the Obligations.
1.7 Information. Each Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of Borrowers’ financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that each Guarantor assumes and incurs under this Loan Guaranty, and agrees that neither Agent nor any Lender shall have any duty to advise any Guarantor of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks.
1.8 Termination. To the maximum extent permitted by law, each Guarantor hereby waives any right to revoke this Loan Guaranty as to future Obligations.  If such a revocation is effective notwithstanding the foregoing waiver, each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that (a) no such revocation shall be effective until written notice thereof has been received by Agent, (b) no such revocation shall apply to any Obligations in existence on the date of receipt by Agent of such written notice (including any subsequent continuation, extension, or renewal thereof, or change in the interest rate, payment terms, or other terms and conditions thereof), (c) no such revocation shall apply to any Obligations made or created after such date to the extent made or created pursuant to a legally binding commitment of any Lender, (d) no payment by any Borrower, any other Guarantor, or from any other source, prior to the date of Agent’s receipt of written notice of such revocation shall reduce the maximum obligation of any Guarantor hereunder, and (e) any payment, by any Borrower or from any source other than a Guarantor which has made such a revocation, made subsequent to the date of such revocation, shall first be applied to that portion of the Obligations as to which the revocation is effective and which are not, therefore, guarantied hereunder, and to the extent so applied shall not reduce the maximum obligation of any Guarantor hereunder.
1.9 Maximum Liability. The provisions of this Loan Guaranty are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any federal or state corporate law or other law governing business entities, or any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under this Loan Guaranty would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of such Guarantor’s liability under this Loan Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Loan Guaranty to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Loan Parties, Agent or any Lender, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding (such highest amount determined hereunder being the relevant Guarantor’s “ Maximum Liability ”). This Section with respect to the Maximum Liability of each Guarantor is intended solely to preserve the rights of Agent and Lenders to the maximum extent not subject to avoidance under applicable law, and no Guarantor nor any other Person shall have any right or claim under this Section with respect to such Maximum Liability, except to the extent necessary so that the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder shall not be rendered voidable under applicable law. Each Guarantor agrees that the Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum Liability of each Guarantor without impairing this Loan Guaranty or affecting the rights and remedies of Agent and Lenders hereunder, provided , that, nothing in this sentence shall be construed to increase any Guarantor’s obligations hereunder beyond its Maximum Liability.
1.10 Contribution. In the event any Guarantor shall make any payment or payments under this Loan Guaranty or shall suffer any loss as a result of any realization upon any collateral granted by it to secure its obligations under this Loan Guaranty (such Guarantor a “ Paying Guarantor ”), each other Guarantor (each a “ Non-Paying Guarantor ”) shall contribute to such Paying Guarantor an amount equal to such Non-Paying Guarantor’s “Applicable Percentage” of such payment or payments made, or losses suffered, by such Paying Guarantor. For purposes of this Section 8.10, each Non-Paying Guarantor’s “Applicable Percentage” with respect to any such payment or loss by a Paying Guarantor shall be determined as of the date on which such payment or loss was made by reference to the ratio of (a) such
-38-
Non-Paying Guarantor’s Maximum Liability as of such date (without giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution hereunder) or, if such Non-Paying Guarantor’s Maximum Liability has not been determined, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such Non-Paying Guarantor from Borrowers after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other means) to (b) the aggregate Maximum Liability of all Loan Parties hereunder (including such Paying Guarantor) as of such date (without giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution hereunder), or to the extent that a Maximum Liability has not been determined for any Guarantor, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such Loan Parties from Borrowers after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital infusion or by other means). Nothing in this provision shall affect any Guarantor’s several liability for the entire amount of the Obligations (up to such Guarantor’s Maximum Liability). Each of the Loan Parties covenants and agrees that its right to receive any contribution under this Loan Guaranty from a Non-Paying Guarantor shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the payment in full in cash of all of the Obligations. This provision is for the benefit of Agent, each Lender and the Loan Parties and may be enforced by any one, or more, or all of them in accordance with the terms hereof.
1.11 Liability Cumulative. The liability of each Guarantor under this Section 8 is in addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of each Guarantor to Agent and each Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Guarantor is a party or in respect of any obligations or liabilities of the other Loan Parties, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically provides to the contrary.
9. PAYMENTS FREE OF TAXES; OBLIGATION TO WITHHOLD; PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF TAXES.
1.1 Taxes.
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Loan Parties hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent permitted by applicable laws be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If, however, applicable laws require the Loan Parties to withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such laws as the case may be, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to clause (e) below.
(b) If any Loan Party shall be required by applicable law to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (i) such Loan Party shall withhold or make such deductions as are required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to clause (e) below, (ii) such Loan Party shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the applicable law, and (iii) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Loan Parties shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. Upon request by Agent or any Lender or other Recipient, Borrowers shall deliver to Agent or such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment of Indemnified Taxes, a copy of any return required by applicable law to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Agent or such Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be.
(c) Without limiting the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) above, the Loan Parties shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(d) Without limiting the provisions of subsections (a) through (c) above, each Loan Party shall, and does hereby, on a joint and several basis indemnify Agent, each Lender and each other Recipient (and their respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates and agents) and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid or incurred by Agent, such Lender or any other Recipient on account of, or in connection with any Loan Document or a breach by any Loan Party
-39-
thereof, and any penalties, interest and related expenses and losses arising therefrom or with respect thereto (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel or other tax advisor for Agent, any Lender or any other Recipient (or their respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates, and agents)), whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to Borrowers by such Recipient shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 9.1 shall remain operative even after the Termination Date and shall survive the payment in full of all of the Loans.
(e) If Agent, any Lender or any Participant is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document, Agent and each Lender, as applicable shall deliver to Borrowers and each such Participant shall deliver to such Lender granting the participation, at the time or times prescribed by applicable laws or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or such Lender granting the participation, such properly completed and executed documentation as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, Agent and each Lender shall deliver to Borrowers and each Participant shall deliver to Agent and such Lender granting the participation, at the time or times prescribed by applicable laws or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or such Lender granting the participation, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable laws or by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction or such other reasonably requested information as will enable Borrowers or such Lender granting the participation, as the case may be, to determine (i) whether or not payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document are subject to Taxes or information reporting requirements, (ii) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, and (iii) such Lender’s or Participant’s entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Recipient by the Loan Parties pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Recipient’s status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 9.1(e)(i), (ii) or (iii)) shall not be required if in the Lender’s or Participant’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender or Participant to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender or Participant (this provision shall be referred to as the “ Lender Documentation Exception ”).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if a Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States:
(i) Each Lender (or Participant) that is a “United States person” within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to Borrowers (or such Lender granting a participation as applicable) on or about the date on which such Lender becomes a lender (or such Participant is granted a participation) under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or such Lender granting such participation), executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form), certifying that such Lender (or such Participant) is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(ii) Each Lender (or Participant) that is not a “United States person” within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a “ Non-U.S. Recipient ”) shall deliver to Borrowers (and such Lender granting a participation in case the Non-U.S. Recipient is a Participant) on or prior to the date on which such Non-U.S. Recipient becomes a lender (or such Participant is granted a participation) under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrowers or such Lender granting such participation but only if such Non-U.S. Recipient is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable: (A) executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form) or Form W-8BEN-E (or any successor form) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty; (B) executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor form); (C) to the extent a Non-U.S. Recipient is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any successor form) accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I-1 or Exhibit I-2, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification
-40-
documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Non-U.S. Recipient is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Recipient are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Recipient may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I-3 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner and all other required supporting documentation; (D) each Non-U.S. Recipient claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, shall provide (x) a certificate to the effect that such Non-U.S. Recipient is not (I) a “bank” within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (II) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrowers within the meaning of section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or (III) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “ U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate ”) and (y) executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form) or Form W-8BEN-E (or any successor form); and/or (E) executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law (including FATCA) as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit Borrowers or any Lender granting a participation, to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made;
(iii) If a payment made to Agent or any Lender (or Participant) under any Loan Document would be subject to United States federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if Agent or such Lender (or such Participant) were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), Agent or such Lender (or such Participant) shall deliver to the Borrowers and such Lender granting such participation at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or such Lender granting such participation such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or such Lender granting such participation as may be necessary for the Borrowers and such Lender granting such participation to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender or such Participant has complied with such Lender’s or such Participant’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this (iii), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement; and
(iv) If any form or certification previously delivered by any Lender (or any Participant) expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, such Lender (or any Participant) shall update such form or certification or promptly notify Borrowers (or such Lender granting a participation) of its legal inability to do so.
(f) If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 9.1 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 9.1), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 9.1(f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.1(f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 9.1(f) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. For purposes of this Section 9.1(f), all references to “refund” shall include the monetary benefit of a credit received in lieu of a refund of Taxes.
(g) Each party’s obligations under this Section 9.1 shall survive any assignment of rights by any Lender or any Participant and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder, except that any of the matters governed by Section 10.5(a)(i) through (iii) that affect such Defaulting Lender may not be amended without the consent of such Defaulting Lender.

1.8 Benefit of Agreement; Assignability; Servicer .
(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors, assigns, heirs, beneficiaries and representatives of Borrowers, each other Loan Party party hereto, Agent and each Lender; provided , that (a) neither any Borrower nor any other Loan Party may assign or transfer any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Agent, and any prohibited assignment shall be void and (b) assignments by any Lender shall be subject to Sections 10.8(b) through 10.8(d). No consent by Agent to any assignment shall release any Loan Party from its liability for any of the Obligations. Agent and each Lender shall have the right to assign all or any of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to one or more other Persons, and each Loan Party agrees, to the extent applicable, to execute any agreements, instruments and documents reasonably requested by Agent in connection with any such assignments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, each Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or grant to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank.
(b) Lender Assignments. Each Lender may sell, transfer, negotiate or assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder (including all or a portion of its Commitments and its rights and obligations with respect to its portion of the Loans) (each a “Sale”) to:
(i) any existing Lender;
(ii) any Affiliate or Approved Fund of any existing Lender;
(iii) any other Person acceptable to (x) Agent and (y) which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, Borrowers; provided , however , that:
(A)     in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of Borrowers shall not be required for any Sale;
(B)     the consent of Borrower shall be deemed to have been given unless an objection is delivered to Agent within ten (10) Business Days after notice of a proposed Sale is delivered to Borrowers;
-46-
(C)     for each Revolving Loan, the aggregate outstanding principal amount (determined as of the effective date of the applicable Assignment and Acceptance) of the Revolving Loan and the Commitments subject to any such Sale shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000, unless such Sale is made to an existing Lender or an Affiliate or Approved Fund of any existing Lender, is of the assignor’s (together with its Affiliates and Approved Funds) entire interest in such facility or is made with the prior consent of Agent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent’s refusal to accept a Sale to a Loan Party, a Subsidiary or Affiliate of a Loan Party, or the imposition of conditions or limitations (including limitations on voting) upon Sales to such Persons, shall not be deemed to be unreasonable. No assignment hereunder shall be permitted if to any Ineligible Assignee.
(c) Procedure . The parties to each Sale made in reliance on clause (b) above (other than those described in clause (e) below) shall execute and deliver to Agent an Assignment and Acceptance evidencing such Sale, together with any existing note subject to such Sale (or any affidavit of loss therefor acceptable to Agent), any Tax forms required to be delivered pursuant to Section 9 and payment of an assignment fee in the amount of $3,500 to Agent, unless waived or reduced by Agent, provided that (1) if a Sale by a Lender is made to an Affiliate or an Approved Fund of such assigning Lender, then no assignment fee shall be due in connection with such Sale, and (2) if a Sale by a Lender is made to an assignee that is not an Affiliate or Approved Fund of such assignor Lender, and concurrently to one or more Affiliates or Approved Funds of such Assignee, then only one assignment fee of $3,500 (unless waived or reduced by Agent) shall be due in connection with such Sale. Upon receipt of all the foregoing, and conditioned upon such receipt and, if such Sale is made in accordance with Section 10.9, upon Agent consenting to such Sale, from and after the effective date specified in the Assignment and Acceptance, Agent shall record or cause to be recorded in the Register the information contained in such Assignment and Acceptance.
(d) Effectiveness . Subject to the Register recording requirements by Agent relating to an Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to Section 10.9 , (i) the assignee thereunder shall become a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations under the Loan Documents have been assigned to such assignee pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender, (ii) any applicable note shall be transferred to such assignee through such entry and (iii) the assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations under this Agreement have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights (except for those surviving the termination of the Commitments and the payment in full of the Obligations) and be released from its obligations under the Loan Documents, other than those relating to events or circumstances occurring prior to such assignment (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).
(e) In the event of any assignment by Siena Lending Group LLC of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an Affiliate of Siena Lending Group LLC (an “ Affiliate Assignee ”) and at all times thereafter, Servicer shall be deemed to act as servicer and agent for the applicable Affiliate Assignee, and Servicer will retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, to approve any amendment, restatement, modification, supplement or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and to receive or collect all payments with respect to the Obligations. By acceptance of any such assignment, each Affiliate Assignee irrevocably appoints Servicer as servicer and agent for the purposes of servicing and managing the Loans, and authorizes Servicer to take such actions and to exercise such powers on behalf of such Affiliate Assignee as are reasonably necessary or advisable and incidental thereto, including the sole and exclusive authority to: (i) possess, keep and maintain books and records with respect to the Loans, (ii) receive, process, account for, deliver or arrange for the delivery of, all Collections in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (iii) monitor and pursue payment of all Obligations; (iv) monitor, manage and perfect security interests in all Collateral for the Obligations, including without limitation, to make the determination of whether any Accounts, Inventory and Equipment constitute Eligible Billed Accounts, Eligible Unbilled Accounts, Eligible Inventory or Eligible Equipment, as applicable, or whether to impose, modify or release any Reserve; (v) exercise any rights or remedies with respect to the Obligations and the Collateral available under law or in equity, including, without limitation, any non-judicial and
-47-
judicial enforcement, liquidation and collection of the Obligations, and the engagement of attorneys and other professionals for such purpose; and (vi) take all lawful actions and procedures required to (A) cause Borrowers to promptly and diligently comply with Borrowers’ obligations under the Loan Documents; (B) maximize the value of the Collateral; and (C) collect and enforce payment of all Obligations. Each Affiliate Assignee agrees that any action taken by Servicer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and the exercise by Servicer of its powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers that are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized by and binding upon all of the Affiliate Assignees. Servicer’s exercise of its discretion in connection with the foregoing matters, if exercised in good faith, shall exonerate Servicer from liability to any Affiliate Assignee and other Person for any error in judgment. Servicer may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more agents appointed by Servicer. Servicer shall not be liable to any Affiliate Assignee for any action taken or omitted to be taken under the Loan Documents, except for losses directly and solely caused by the Servicer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, and Servicer does not assume any responsibility for any failure or delay in performance or any breach by any Loan Party or any other Person of any obligations under the Loan Documents. In the event that a petition seeking relief under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or similar law is filed by or against any Loan Party, or any other Person obligated under any Loan Document, Servicer is authorized, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to act on behalf of the Affiliate Assignees in connection with such proceeding, including, without limitation, to file proofs of claim on behalf of itself and the Affiliate Assignees in such proceeding for the total amount of obligations owed by Loan Parties, or any of them, or any other Person under any Loan Document.
(f) Servicer may resign on sixty (60) days written notice to Agent and Borrowing Agent and upon such resignation, Agent will promptly designate a successor Servicer reasonably satisfactory to Borrowers (provided that no such approval by Borrowers shall be required (i) in any case where the successor Servicer is a Lender or an Affiliate or Subsidiary of a Lender or (ii) after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default). Any such successor Servicer shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of Servicer, and shall in particular succeed to all of Servicer’s right, title and interest in and to all of the Liens in the Collateral securing the Obligations created hereunder or any other Loan Document (including the Collateral Pledge Agreements, and all account control agreements), and the term “Servicer” shall mean such successor Servicer effective upon its appointment, and the former Servicer’s rights, powers and duties as Servicer shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Servicer. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time of the effectiveness of the new Servicer’s appointment, any further actions need to be taken in order to provide for the legally binding and valid transfer of any Liens in the Collateral from former Servicer to new Servicer and/or for the perfection of any Liens in the Collateral as held by new Servicer or it is otherwise not then possible for new Servicer to become the holder of a fully valid, enforceable and perfected Lien as to any of the Collateral, former Servicer shall continue to hold such Liens solely as Servicer for perfection of such Liens on behalf of new Servicer until such time as new Servicer can obtain a fully valid, enforceable and perfected Lien on all Collateral, provided that Servicer shall not be required to or have any liability or responsibility to take any further actions after such date as such Servicer for perfection to continue the perfection of any such Liens (other than to forego from taking any affirmative action to release any such Liens). After any Servicer’s resignation as Servicer, the provisions of this Section 10.8, and any indemnification rights under this Agreement, including without limitation, rights arising under Section 10.7 hereof, shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Servicer under this Agreement (and in the event resigning Servicer continues to hold any Liens pursuant to the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, the provisions of this Section 10.8 and any indemnification rights under this Agreement, including without limitation, rights arising under Article 6 hereof, shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it in connection with such Liens).

In the event of a sale by any Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, (a) such Lender’s obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged for all purposes, (b) Borrowers and Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with each other in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (c) all amounts payable by Borrowers shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation and shall be paid directly to such Lender; provided, however , a Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.1 as if it were a Lender if Borrowers are notified of the participation and the Participant complies with Section 9.1(e). Borrowers agree that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement or any other Loan Document are due and payable (as a result of acceleration or otherwise), each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement; provided , that such right of set-off shall not be exercised without the prior written consent of such Lender and shall be subject to the obligation of each Participant to share with such Lender its share thereof. Borrowers also agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.9 as if it were a Lender. Notwithstanding the granting of any such participating interests: (x) Borrowers shall look solely to Lenders for all purposes of this Agreement, the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby, (y) Borrowers shall at all times have the right to rely upon any amendments, waivers or consents signed by Agent and Required Lenders as being binding upon all of the Participants, and (z) all communications in respect of this Agreement and such transactions shall remain solely between Borrowers, Agent and Lenders (exclusive of Participants) hereunder. Each Lender granting a participation hereunder shall maintain, as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrowers, a register as to the participations granted and transferred under this Section containing the same information specified in Section 10.9 on the Register as if each Participant were a Lender to the extent required to cause the Loans to be in registered form for the purposes of Sections 163(f), 165(j), 871, 881, and 4701 of the Code.

(ii) Notwithstanding clause (c)(i) above, Agent shall not be required to take, or to omit to take, any action (A) unless, upon demand, Agent receives an indemnification satisfactory to it from the Lenders (or, to the extent applicable and acceptable to Agent, any other Person) against all liabilities that, by reason of such action or omission, may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against

(e) Delegation of Rights and Duties . Agent may, upon any term or condition it specifies, delegate or exercise any of their respective rights, powers and remedies under, and delegate or perform any of its duties or any other action with respect to, any Loan Document by or through any trustee, co-agent, employee, attorney-in-fact and any other Person (including any Lender).

(ii) Agent and its Related Persons shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with any Loan Document, and each Lender and Loan Party hereby waive and shall not assert (and Borrower shall cause each other Loan Party not a signatory hereto to waive and agree not to assert) any right, claim or cause of action based thereon, except to the extent of liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or, as the case may be, such Related Person (each as determined in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction) in connection with the duties expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the foregoing, Agent: (A) shall not be responsible or otherwise incur liability to any Lender or other Person for any action or omission taken in reliance upon the instructions of the Required Lenders or for the actions or omissions of any of its Related Persons selected with reasonable care (other than employees, officers and directors of Agent, when acting on behalf of Agent); (B) shall not be responsible to any Lender or other Person for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, effectiveness, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the attachment, perfection or priority of any Lien created or purported to be created under or in connection with, any Loan Document; (C) make no warranty or representation, and shall not be responsible, to any Lender or other Person for any statement, document, information, representation or warranty made or furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party or any Related Person of any Loan Party in connection with any Loan Document or any transaction contemplated therein or any other document or information with respect to any Loan Party, whether or not transmitted or (except for documents expressly required under any Loan Document to be transmitted to the Lenders) omitted to be transmitted by Agent, including as to completeness, accuracy, scope or adequacy thereof, or for the scope, nature or results of any due diligence performed by Agent in connection with the Loan Documents; and (D) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any provision of any Loan Document, whether any condition set forth in any Loan Document is satisfied or waived, as to the financial condition of any Loan Party or as to the existence or continuation or possible occurrence or continuation of any Default or Event of Default and shall not be deemed to have notice or knowledge of such occurrence or continuation unless it has received a notice from Borrower or any Lender describing such Default or Event of Default clearly labeled “notice of default” (in which case Agent shall promptly give notice of such receipt to all Lenders). For each of the items set forth in clauses (A) through (D) above, each Lender and the Loan Parties hereby waive and agree not to assert (and Borrower shall cause each other Loan Party not a signatory hereto to waive and agree not to assert) any right, claim or cause of action it might have against Agent based thereon.
(g) Agent Individually . Agent and its Affiliates may make loans and other extensions of credit to, acquire Equity Interests of, engage in any kind of business with, any Loan Party or Affiliate thereof as though it were not acting as Agent, and may receive separate fees and other payments therefor. To the extent Agent or any of its Affiliates makes any portion of the Revolving Loans or otherwise becomes a Lender hereunder, it shall have and may exercise the same rights and powers hereunder and shall be subject to the same obligations and liabilities as any other Lender and the terms “Lender” and “Required Lender” and any similar terms shall, except where otherwise expressly provided in any Loan Document, include Agent or such Affiliate, as the case may be, in its individual capacity as Lender or as one of the Required Lenders.
(h) Lender Credit Decision .
(i) Each Lender acknowledges that it shall, independently and without reliance upon Agent or any Lender or any of their Related Persons or upon any document (including any offering and disclosure materials in connection with the syndication of the Loans) solely or in part because such document was transmitted by Agent or any of its Related Persons, conduct its own independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of each Loan Party and make and continue to make its own credit decisions in connection with entering into, and taking or not taking any action under, any Loan Document or with respect to any transaction contemplated in any Loan Document, in each case based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate. Except for documents expressly required by any Loan Document to be transmitted by Agent to the Lenders, Agent shall have no duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any Affiliate of any Loan Party that may come in to the possession of Agent or any of its Related Persons.
(ii) If any Lender has elected to abstain from receiving material non-public information (“ MNPI ”) concerning the Loan Parties or their Affiliates such Lender acknowledges that, notwithstanding such election, Agent and/or the Loan Parties will, from time to time, make available
-54-
syndicate-information (which may contain MNPI) as required by the terms of, or in the course of administering the Revolving Loans to the credit contact(s) identified for receipt of such information on the Lender’s administrative questionnaire who are able to receive and use all syndicate-level information (which may contain MNPI) in accordance with such Lender’s compliance policies and contractual obligations and applicable law, including federal and state securities laws; provided , that if such contact is not so identified in such questionnaire, the relevant Lender hereby agrees to promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) provide such a contact to Agent and the Loan Parties upon request therefor by Agent or the Loan Parties. Notwithstanding such Lender’s election to abstain from receiving MNPI, such Lender acknowledges that if such Lender chooses to communicate with Agent, it assumes the risk of receiving MNPI concerning the Loan Parties or their Affiliates.
(i) Expenses; Indemnities; Withholding .
(i) Each Lender agrees to reimburse Agent and its Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by any Loan Party), promptly upon demand, severally and ratably, for any reasonable costs and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of financial, legal and other advisors and Other Taxes paid in the name of, or on behalf of, any Loan Party) that may be incurred by Agent or its Related Persons in connection with the preparation, syndication, execution, delivery, administration, modification, consent, waiver or enforcement of, or the taking of any other action (whether through negotiations, through any work-out, bankruptcy, restructuring or other legal or other proceeding (including preparation for and/or response to any subpoena or request for document production relating thereto or otherwise)) in respect of, or legal advice with respect to its rights or responsibilities under, any Loan Document.
(ii) Each Lender further agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Agent and its Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by any Loan Party), in each case, severally and ratably, harmless from and against liabilities (including, to the extent not indemnified pursuant to Section 9, Taxes, interests and penalties imposed for not properly withholding or backup withholding on payments made to or for the account of any Lender) that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against Agent or its Related Persons in any matter relating to or arising out of, in connection with or as a result of any Loan Document, any related document or any other act, event or transaction related, contemplated in or attendant to any such document, or, in each case, any action taken or omitted to be taken by Agent or its Related Persons under or with respect to any of the foregoing; provided , that no Lender shall be liable to Agent or its Related Persons to the extent such liability has resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or, as the case may be, such Related Person, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment or order.
(iii) To the extent required by any requirement of law, Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender under a Loan Document an amount equal to any applicable withholding Tax (including withholding Taxes imposed under Chapters 3 and 4 of Subtitle A of the Code). If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate certification form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or fails to establish an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax with respect to a particular type of payment, or because such Lender failed to notify Agent or any other Person of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective, failed to maintain a Register and/or Participant Register or for any other reason), or Agent reasonably determines that it was required to withhold Taxes from a prior payment but failed to do so, such Lender shall promptly indemnify Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by Agent as Tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and together with all expenses incurred by Agent, including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses. Agent may offset against any payment to any Lender under a Loan Document, any applicable withholding Tax that was required to be withheld from any prior payment to such Lender but which was not so withheld, as well as any other amounts for which Agent or Revolver Agent is entitled to indemnification from such Lender under this Section 10.19(i)(iii).
(j) Resignation of Agent .
(i) Agent may resign at any time by delivering notice of such resignation to the Lenders and Borrowers, effective on the date set forth in such notice or, if no such date is set forth therein, upon the date such notice shall be effective in accordance with the terms of this Section
-55-
10.19(j)(i). If Agent delivers any such notice, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent. If, after thirty (30) days after the date of the retiring Agent’s notice of resignation, no successor Agent has been appointed by the Required Lenders that has accepted such appointment, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent from among the Lenders. Each resignation and appointment under this clause (i) shall be subject to the prior consent of Borrowers which may not be unreasonably withheld but shall not be required during the continuance of an Event of Default.
(ii) Effective immediately upon its resignation, (A) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents, (B) the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the retiring Agent until a successor Agent shall have accepted a valid appointment hereunder, (C) the retiring Agent and its Related Persons shall no longer have the benefit of any provision of any Loan Document other than with respect to any actions taken or omitted to be taken while such retiring Agent was, or because such retiring Agent had been, validly acting as Agent under the Loan Documents and (D) subject to its rights under Section 10.19(c), the retiring Agent shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary to assign to the successor Agent its rights as Agent under the Loan Documents. Effective immediately upon its acceptance of a valid appointment as Agent a successor Agent shall succeed to, and become vested with, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent under the Loan Documents.
(k) Release of Collateral or Guarantors . Each Lender hereby consents to the release and hereby directs Agent to release (or, in the case of clause (ii)(B) below, release or subordinate) the following:
(i) any Subsidiary of Borrower from its guaranty of any Obligation if all of the Equity Interests of such Subsidiary owned by any Loan Party are sold or transferred in a transaction expressly permitted under the Loan Documents (including pursuant to a waiver or consent), to the extent that, after giving effect to such transaction, such Subsidiary would not be required to guaranty any Obligations pursuant to the Loan Documents; and
(ii) any Lien held by Agent for the benefit of the Lenders against (A) any Collateral that is sold, transferred, conveyed or otherwise disposed of by a Loan Party in a transaction expressly permitted by the Loan Documents (including pursuant to a valid waiver or consent), to the extent all Liens required to be granted in such Collateral pursuant to the Loan Documents after giving effect to such transaction have been granted, (B) any property subject to a Lien permitted hereunder in reliance upon clause (c) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness and clause (a) of the definition of Permitted Liens and (C) all of the Collateral and all Loan Parties, upon (x) the occurrence of the Termination Date and (y) to the extent requested by Agent, receipt by Agent and the Lenders of liability releases from the Loan Parties each in form and substance satisfactory to Agent.
Each Lender hereby directs Agent, and Agent hereby agrees, upon receipt of reasonable advance written notice from Borrower, to execute and deliver or file such documents and to perform other actions reasonably necessary to release the guaranties and Liens when and as directed in this Section 10.19(k).
1.20 Settlements; Payments . The Outstanding Amount may fluctuate from day to day through Agent’s disbursement of funds to, and receipt of funds from, Borrowers. In order to minimize the frequency of transfers of funds between Agent and each Lender, repayments of Loans may, at the election of Agent, be settled according to the procedures set forth in this Section 10.20. Notwithstanding the procedures set forth in this Section 10.20, each Lender’s obligation to fund its portion of any advances made by Agent to Borrowers will commence on the date such advances are made by Agent. Such payments will be made by such Lender without set-off, counterclaim or reduction of any kind.
(a) Each Settlement Date Agent will advise each Lender by 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on a Business Day by telephone or written notice in accordance with this Agreement of the amount of each such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount. If payments are necessary to adjust the amount of such Lender’s share of the Outstanding Amount to such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount, the party from which such payment is due will pay the other party, in same day funds, by wire transfer to the other’s account, not later than 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the Business Day immediately following the Settlement Date (provided that if Agent gives such notice at or prior to 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the Settlement Date, such funding shall be made on the Settlement Date).
-56-
(b) On the first Business Day of each month (each, an “ Interest Settlement Date ”), Agent will advise each Lender by written notice in accordance with this Agreement of the amount of interest and fees charged to and collected from Borrowers for the preceding month in respect of the Loans. Provided that such Lender is not then a Defaulting Lender, Agent will pay to such Lender, by wire transfer to such Lender’s account (as specified by such Lender in accordance with this Agreement) such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such interest and fees not later than the next Business Day following the Interest Settlement Date.
1.21 Defaulting Lender . If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a) such Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Commitment and outstanding Revolving Loans shall be excluded for purposes of calculating the fee payable to Lenders in respect of the Unused Line Fee, and such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Unused Line Fee with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Commitment or Revolving Loans (in each case not including any fee in connection with any portion of such Defaulting Lenders Revolving Commitment that has been reallocated to non-Defaulting Lenders pursuant to Section 10.21(d) hereof).
(b) the Revolving Commitments and Loans of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 10.5).
(c) in the event a Defaulting Lender has defaulted on its obligation to fund any Revolving Loan, or purchase any participation pursuant to Section 1.5 hereof, until such time as the Default Excess with respect to such Defaulting Lender has been reduced to zero, any prepayments or repayments on account of the Revolving Loans or participations pursuant to Section 1.5, in each case to the extent they would be otherwise be payable to such Defaulting Lender, shall be applied first , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to Agent hereunder; second , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Issuing Bank or Letter of Credit guarantor/indemnitor hereunder; third , to provide cash collateral in the amount of 103% of the Issuing Bank’s (or the Letter of Credit guarantor/indemnitor’s, as the case may be) Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender; fourth , as the Borrowers may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by Agent; fifth , if so determined by Agent and the Borrowers, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) provide cash collateral in the amount of 103% of the Issuing Bank’s (or the Letter of Credit guarantor/indemnitor’s, as the case may be) future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement; sixth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or the Letter of Credit guarantor/indemnitor as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, the Issuing Bank or the Letter of Credit guarantor/indemnitor against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; seventh , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrowers as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrowers against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and eighth , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided , that , if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or Letter of Credit Balance in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans or Letter of Credit Balance were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 1.6 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and Letter of Credit Balance owed to, all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or Letter of Credit Balance owed to, such Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 10.21(c) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
(d) If any Letter of Credit Balance exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
-57-
(i) so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists, all or any part of such Letter of Credit Balance shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares of the total Revolving Commitments (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Commitments), provided that no Lender’s Revolving Exposure shall exceed its Revolving Commitment;
(ii) if the reallocation described in paragraph (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall within one (1) Business Day following notice by Agent, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender’s Pro Rata Share of Letter of Credit Balance (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to paragraph (i) above) for so long as any such Letter of Credit Balance remains are outstanding;
(iii) if the Borrowers cash collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Balance pursuant to this Section 10.21(d), the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any Letter of Credit Fees to such Defaulting Lender with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Balance which have been cash collateralized (and the Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any such fees);
(iv) if the Defaulting Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Balance is reallocated pursuant to this Section 10.21(d), then the Letter of Credit Fees payable to the non-Defaulting Lenders shall be adjusted accordingly; and
(v) if any Defaulting Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Balance is not cash collateralized or reallocated pursuant to this Section 10.21(d), then without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the applicable Letter of Credit guarantor/indemnitor or Issuing Bank hereunder, all Letter of Credit Fees payable hereunder with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Balance shall be payable to the Issuing Bank or if applicable, the Letter of Credit guarantor/indemnitor.
(e) So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no Issuing Bank or Letter of Credit guarantor/indemnitor shall be required to issue, extend or increase any Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit Guaranty, in each case unless it is reasonably satisfied that the related exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrowers, and participating interests in any such newly issued, extended or increased Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit guaranty/indemnification shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 10.21(d) (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein).
(f) No reallocation permitted pursuant to Section 10.21(d) shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.
(g) In the event that Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Letter of Credit guarantor/indemnitor each agrees in writing that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters which caused such Lender to become a Defaulting Lender, then the Pro Rata Shares of the Letter of Credit Balance of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Revolving Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Lenders or participations in the Revolving Loans as Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Revolving Loans or participations in accordance with its Pro Rata Share; provided , that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; provided , further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.
(h) The rights and remedies with respect to a Defaulting Lender under this Section 10.21 are in addition to any other rights and remedies which the Borrowers, Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Letter of Credit guarantor/indemnitor, as applicable, may have against such Defaulting Lender.
