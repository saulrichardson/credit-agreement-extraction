COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS
2.1             Commitments .
(a)           Loans . Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date, each Lender, severally and not
jointly, agrees to make Revolving Loans to Borrower in an aggregate principal amount that will not result in (a) such Lender’s
Outstanding Credit Exposure exceeding such Lender’s Commitment or (b) the sum of the Outstanding Credit Exposures for
all the Lenders exceeding the Available Loan Commitment. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Revolving Loans.
(b)           Revolving Nature
of Loan . The Commitments of Lenders to make Revolving Loans shall constitute a revolving line of credit and Revolving Loans
repaid may be reborrowed on a revolving basis through the Maturity Date. Although the outstanding principal of the Obligations
may be zero from time to time, the Loan Documents will remain in full force and effect until all obligations of each Lender to
make Revolving Loans and all other Commitments of Lenders expire and all Obligations are paid and performed in full.
(c)           Ratable Loans .
Each Revolving Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans of the same Type made by the Lenders ratably
in accordance with their respective Commitments.
(d)           Commitment Reductions .
The Borrower may, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate any unused Commitment Amount or reduce the unused
Commitment Amount; provided that any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent three (3) Business Days prior to
the date of such termination or reduction and any such termination or reduction shall be in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 and
any whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. The Borrower may not terminate or reduce the Commitment Amount if after giving
effect thereto and any concurrent payments, a mandatory prepayment would be required under Section 2.4(d). Any such termination
or reduction shall be applied to the Commitments of each Lender based on its Applicable Percentage. If required pursuant to Section
7.1(j) , Borrower shall immediately reduce the Commitment Amount pursuant to this Section 2.1(d) .
2.2           Prepayment
of Loans.
(a)           Right to Prepay .
Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any outstanding principal in whole or in part, subject
to prior notice in accordance with Section 2.2(b) .

Field: /Page
(b)           Method of Prepayment .
Prepayments (other than mandatory prepayments) shall be in a minimum aggregate amount of $100,000 or any integral multiple of $100,000
in excess thereof and Borrower shall give notice to the Administrative Agent of a prepayment not later than 11:00 a.m. (Phoenix,
Arizona time) one (1) Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment
date and the principal amount to be prepaid. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount prepaid.
2.3            Interest .
(a)           Interest Rate .
Subject to the provisions of clause (b) below, each Revolving Loan shall bear interest at the applicable Interest Rate.
(b)           Default Rate .
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Revolving Loan or any fee or other amount payable by Borrower
hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest,
after as well as before judgment, at the Default Rate. In addition, from and after an Event of Default, all Obligations shall bear
interest at the Default Rate.
(c)           Late Fee .
If any payment of interest and/or principal is not received by Administrative Agent when such payment is due, then in addition
to the remedies conferred upon the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
(i) a late charge of 5% of the amount due and unpaid or $10.00, whichever is greater (the “ Late Fee ”), will
be added to the delinquent amount for any payment past due in excess of ten (10) days, regardless of any notice and cure periods,
and (ii) the amount due and unpaid (including the unpaid Late Fee) shall bear interest at the Default Rate, computed from the date
on which the amount was due and payable until paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing the Late Fee will not apply to a balloon payment
of principal due upon the maturity of the Loan. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (A) the Late Fee is not a penalty; (B) is
intended to compensate Administrative Agent and Lenders for the internal administrative costs and expenses of monitoring, handling
and processing late payments (including, for example, staff costs arising from internal and regulatory reporting of delinquencies,
additional underwriting analysis, in-house legal review, and credit committee reviews) over and above the economic costs associated
with the loss of use of money and out of pocket costs otherwise subject to reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents; (C) the amount of the Late Fee is a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm caused by the failure
to timely make the applicable payment; and (D) the actual damage is incapable or very difficult of accurate estimation.
(d)           Interest Payments .
Accrued interest on the Revolving Loans shall be payable in arrears, and Borrower shall pay Administrative Agent all accrued, unpaid
interest on the Loan on each Interest Payment Date and on the Maturity Date; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant
to Section 2.3(b) shall be payable on demand and (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment or other termination of
the credit facility provided pursuant to this Agreement, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable
on the date of such repayment, prepayment or termination.
Field: Page; Sequence: 67; Value: 2
35
Field: /Page
(e)           Computation of
Interest . Interest on the Obligations shall be computed on a 365/360 basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the interest
rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal
balance is outstanding. All interest payable under the Loan is computed using this method. This calculation method results in a
higher effective interest rate than the numeric interest rate stated in this Agreement. By executing below, Borrower hereby acknowledges
and agrees to the calculation of interest in accordance with a year of 360 days and acknowledges that calculation of interest in
accordance with this paragraph will increase the Loan’s effective interest rate above the stated Interest Rate and Default
Rate, as applicable.
(f)            Advances for Interest
and Fees . Borrower and Lenders hereby authorize Administrative Agent and Lenders to make Revolving Loans to pay interest accrued
on the Loan, notwithstanding that Borrower may not have requested a disbursement of such amount. Administrative Agent or any Lender
may make such Revolving Loans notwithstanding that Borrower may be in default under the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document. Nothing in this provision shall prevent Borrower from paying interest and fees from its own funds, or otherwise excuse
Borrower’s obligation to pay such interest and fees. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to obligate Administrative
Agent or any Lender to make such disbursements to pay interest. The authorization hereby granted shall be irrevocable and at Administrative
Agent’s discretion, and no further direction or authorization from Borrower shall be necessary for Administrative Agent to
make such disbursements on behalf of the Lenders.
2.4            Revolving
Loans .
(a)           Method
for Revolving Loans . Subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions precedent in this Agreement, Revolving Loans funded by
the Lenders will be made available to Borrower by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders at the request of a Responsible Officer
of Borrower, which request must be made at least five (5 three
(3 ) Business Days before the date the requested Revolving Loan is to be made. Borrowings will be made not more often than
once per week. Each Draw Request pursuant to this Section shall specify the following information: (i) the aggregate amount of the
requested Borrowing; (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day); (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be
a Base Rate Borrowing or an Index Rate Borrowing; and (iv) the location and number of the Borrower’s account to which funds
are to be disbursed. Promptly following receipt of a Draw Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof
and the amount of such Lender’s Revolving Loans to be made as part of the requested advance. Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders
and the Administrative Agent to make Revolving Loans and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any person or persons
the Administrative Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on behalf of Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing
authorization is specifically intended to allow Draw Requests to be given telephonically. Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the
Administrative Agent a written confirmation (including a written Draw Request), if such confirmation is requested by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by a Responsible Officer. If the written confirmation differs in any material respect
from the action taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall govern
absent manifest error. The Administrative Agent has no duty to monitor for Borrower or to report to Borrower the use of proceeds of Revolving
Loans. Except as provided above, each request for a Revolving Loan submitted by Borrower to the Administrative Agent shall be accompanied
by a Draw Request. Each Revolving Loan shall be in the minimum amount of $100,000 and in increments of $100,000 in excess thereof.

The proceeds of Revolving Loans shall be used for general corporate purposes (including the repayment of existing Indebtedness
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on the Effective Date, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, construction,
horizontal and vertical development and redevelopment) and other lawful corporate purposes not in contravention of any Law or of
any Loan Document.
(c)           Funding by Lenders .
Each Lender shall make its Applicable Percentage of each Revolving Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available
funds at the Administrative Agent’s office not later than 12:00 noon (Phoenix, Arizona time) on the proposed date thereof.
The Administrative Agent will make all such funds so received available to Borrower in like funds, either by wire transfer of such
funds in accordance with the instructions provided in the applicable Draw Request or by deposit to an account of Borrower at Administrative
Agent; provided that Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an L/C Disbursement as provided in Section
2.5(g) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.
(d)           Prepayments .
If for any reason the Outstanding Credit Exposure for all the Lenders at any time exceeds the Available Loan Commitment then in
effect, Borrower shall immediately prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such
excess; provided , however, that Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to
this Section 2.4(d) unless such excess continues after the prepayment in full of the Loans.
(e)           Non-Receipt of
Funds by the Administrative Agent . Unless Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent prior
to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of
a Revolving Loan or (ii) in the case of Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has
been made. The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of such payment available to the intended
recipient in reliance upon such assumption. If such Lender or Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact made such payment to
the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative
Agent the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date
such amount was so made available by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount at a
rate per annum equal to (A) in the case of payment by a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three
(3) days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Revolving Loan or (B) in the case of payment by Borrower,
the interest rate applicable to the relevant Revolving Loan (including the Default Rate, if applicable).
(f)            Elections by Borrower
for Borrowings . The Loans comprising each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Draw Request.
Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert a Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type or to continue such Borrowing as a

(b)           Notice of Issuance,
Amendment, Extension, Reinstatement or Renewal . To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment of the terms
and conditions, extension of the terms and conditions, extension of the expiry date, or reinstatement of amounts paid, or renewal
of an outstanding Letter of Credit), Borrower shall deliver (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing
so have been approved by the respective Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and to the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance
of the requested date of issuance, amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter
of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, extended, reinstated or renewed, and specifying the date of issuance,
amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire
(which shall comply with Section 2.5(d) ), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof,
the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, extend,
reinstate or renew such Letter of Credit. If requested by the Issuing Bank, Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application
and reimbursement agreement on Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. In the
event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter
of credit application and reimbursement agreement or other agreement submitted by Borrower to, or entered into by Borrower with,
the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
(c)           Evergreen Credits .
If the Borrower so requests in any notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, extension, reinstatement
or renewal of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Issuing Bank may, in its sole and absolute discretion (and with no obligation
to do so), agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an “ Evergreen Letter of Credit ”);
 provided that, if and to the extent that the Issuing Bank agrees to issue an Evergreen Letter of Credit, then in addition
to all other requirements for the issuance of Letters of Credit, (i) the Borrower shall pay such additional Letter of Credit fees
with respect thereto (and at such times and for such periods) as the Issuing Bank may require each in its sole and absolute discretion
and (ii) in addition to other requirements of the Issuing Bank, any such Evergreen Letter of Credit shall permit the Issuing Bank
to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of
Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the “ Non-Extension Notice Date ”)
in each such twelve (12) month period to be agreed upon by Borrower and the Issuing Bank at the time such Letter of Credit is issued
(which date will, at a minimum, allow the Issuing Bank to cause such Evergreen Letter of Credit to expire at least 30 days before
the Maturity Date). Unless otherwise directed by the Issuing Bank, Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to
the Issuing Bank for any such extension. Once an Evergreen Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have
authorized (but may not require) the applicable Issuing Bank to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an
expiration date not later than the L/C Commitment Expiration Date; provided , that the Issuing Bank shall not (i) permit
any such extension if (A) the Issuing Bank has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such
time to issue such Letter of Credit in its extended form under the terms hereof (except that the expiration date may be extended
to a date that is no more than one year from the then-current expiry date) or (B) it has received notice (which may be in writing
or by telephone (if promptly confirmed in writing)) on or before the day that is fifteen (15) days before the Non-Extension Notice
Date from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (ii) be obligated to
permit such extension if it has received notice (which may be in writing or by telephone (if promptly confirmed in writing)) on
or before the day that is fifteen (15) days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the
Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.2 is not then satisfied, and in each such
case directing such Issuing Bank not to permit such extension.

(d)           Limitations on
Amounts, Issuance and Amendment . A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, extended, reinstated or renewed only if (and

warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal (i) the aggregate amount of
the outstanding Letters of Credit shall not exceed the L/C Sublimit, (ii) the aggregate L/C Obligations shall not exceed the L/C
Sublimit, (iii) the Outstanding Credit Exposure of any Lender shall not exceed its Commitment and (iv) the Outstanding Credit Exposure
of all Lenders shall not exceed the Available Loan Commitment. In addition, the Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation
to issue any Letter of Credit if:
(i)             Any
order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from
issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the Issuing Bank shall prohibit, the issuance of letters of credit generally
or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction,
reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the date hereof,
or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense that was not applicable on the date hereof and that
the Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it.
(ii)            The
issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally.
(iii)           Except
as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, each in its sole discretion, such Letter of Credit is in
an initial amount less than $500,000.
(iv)          The
Letter of Credit is not a standby letter of credit issued in connection with an approved project to secure obligations of Borrower
or the applicable Project Owner that are directly related to the Approved Lines of Business.
(v)           Any
Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless the Issuing Bank has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash
Collateral, satisfactory to such Issuing Bank (in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such Lender to eliminate the Issuing
Bank’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.17(a)(iv) ) with respect to the Defaulting
Lender arising from either such Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or such Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations
as to which the Issuing Bank has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion.
An Issuing Bank shall be under no
obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time to issue the Letter of Credit
in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment
to the Letter of Credit.

(e)            Expiry Date .
Each Letter of Credit shall have a stated expiry date no later than the earlier of (i) the date twelve (12) months after the date
of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any extension of the expiration date thereof, twelve months after
the then-current expiration date of such Letter of Credit) and (ii) the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date.
(f)            Participations .
By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount or extending the expiration
date thereof), and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to
each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender’s
Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees
that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute, unconditional
and irrevocable and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, extension, reinstatement or
renewal of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments.
In consideration and in
furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent, for account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each L/C Disbursement made by the Issuing
Bank promptly upon the request of the Issuing Bank at any time from the time of such L/C Disbursement until such L/C Disbursement
is reimbursed by Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to Borrower for any reason,
including after the Maturity Date. Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.4(c) with respect to Loans made by such Lender
(and Section 2.4(c) shall apply, mutatis mutandis , to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative
Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.5(g) , the Administrative Agent shall distribute
such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse
the Issuing Bank, then to such Lenders and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant
to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any L/C Disbursement shall not constitute a Revolving Loan and shall not relieve
the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such L/C Disbursement.
Each Lender further acknowledges
and agrees that its participation in each Letter of Credit will be automatically adjusted to reflect such Lender’s Applicable
Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit at each time such Lender’s Commitment
is amended pursuant to the operation of Section 2.13 , as a result of an assignment in accordance with Section 10.5 
or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement.

(g)           Reimbursement .
If the Issuing Bank shall make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, Borrower shall reimburse the Issuing Bank
in respect of such L/C Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such L/C Disbursement not later than
noon (Phoenix, Arizona time) on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives notice from Administrative
Agent or Issuing Bank; provided that, if Borrower has otherwise satisfied all of the conditions and requirements for a Revolving
Loan and is entitled to immediate funding of the Revolving Loan as of the date such reimbursement is due, Borrower may request
in accordance with this Agreement that such payment be financed with a Revolving Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent
so financed, the Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Revolving Loan.
If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable L/C Disbursement,
the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof.
(h)           Obligations Absolute .
The Borrower’s obligation to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in Section 2.5(g) shall be absolute, unconditional
and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances
whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any Letter
of Credit, or any term or provision herein or therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving
to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement in such draft or other document being untrue or inaccurate
in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that
does not comply strictly with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or
not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge
of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower’s obligations hereunder.
None of the Administrative
Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank, or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or
in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the Issuing Bank or any payment or failure to make any payment
thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption,
loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit
(including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms, any error in translation
or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be
construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential
damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable Law) suffered by the
Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents
presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction),
the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination, and that:

Issuing Bank may replace a purportedly lost, stolen, or destroyed original Letter of Credit or missing amendment thereto with a
replacement marked as such or waive a requirement for its presentation;
(ii)            the
Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment
upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit
and without regard to any non-documentary condition in such Letter of Credit;
(iii)          the
Issuing Bank shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such
documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and
(iv)          this
paragraph shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by the Issuing Bank when determining whether drafts and other documents
presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing).
Without limiting the foregoing,
none of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank, or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility
by reason of (i) any presentation that includes forged or fraudulent documents or that is otherwise affected by the fraudulent,
bad faith, or illegal conduct of the beneficiary or other Person, (ii) the Issuing Bank declining to take-up documents and make
payment (A) against documents that are fraudulent, forged, or for other reasons by which that it is entitled not to honor or (B)
following a Borrower’s waiver of discrepancies with respect to such documents or request for honor of such documents or (iii)
the Issuing Bank retaining proceeds of a Letter of Credit based on an apparently applicable attachment order, blocking regulation,
or third-party claim notified to such Issuing Bank.
Unless otherwise expressly
agreed by the Issuing Bank and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued by it, the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter
of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuing Bank shall not be responsible to the Borrower for, and the Issuing Bank’s
rights and remedies against the Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of the Issuing Bank required or permitted
under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including
the Laws or any order of a jurisdiction where the Issuing Bank or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or
in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the International Chamber of Commerce Banking Commission,
the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade (BAFT), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or
not any Letter of Credit chooses such laws or practice rules.
The Issuing Bank shall act
on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit and the documents associated therewith, and the Issuing Bank shall
have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article 9 of this Agreement with respect
to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the Issuing Bank in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be
issued by it and L/C Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term “Administrative Agent”
as used in Article 9 of this Agreement included the Issuing Bank with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally

(i)            Disbursement Procedures .
The Issuing Bank shall, within the time allowed by applicable Laws or the specific terms of the Letter of Credit following its
receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank
shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing of such demand for payment if
such Issuing Bank has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving
such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any
such L/C Disbursement.
(j)            Interim Interest .
If the Issuing Bank for any Letter of Credit shall make any L/C Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C
Disbursement in full on the date such L/C Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from
and including the date such L/C Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such L/C Disbursement,
at the rate per annum then applicable to Base Rate Revolving Loans; provided that if the Borrower fails to reimburse such
L/C Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.5(g) , then the Default Rate shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this
paragraph shall be for account of such Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender
pursuant to Section 2.5(g) to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
(k)           Replacement of
an Issuing Bank . The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement between the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such
replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid L/C
Fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.14(c) . From and after the effective date
of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this
Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Issuing
Bank” shall be deemed to include such successor or any previous Issuing Bank. After the replacement of the Issuing Bank hereunder,
the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank
under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue
additional Letters of Credit.

resignation of the Issuing Bank hereunder, the retiring Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all
the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with respect to Letters of Credit
issued by it prior to such resignation, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit or to extend, reinstate,
renew or increase any existing Letter of Credit.

If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing or if a deposit of cash collateral is otherwise required pursuant to this
 Section 2.5 or any other provision of the Loan Documents, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with L/C Obligations
representing at least 50% of the total L/C Obligations) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the
Borrower shall immediately deposit into an account established and maintained on the books and records of the Administrative Agent
(the “ Collateral Account ”) an amount in cash equal to 105% of the total L/C Obligations as of such date plus 
any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective
immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence
of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in Sections 8.1(f) and (g) . Such deposit shall be
held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement,
and Borrower grants to Administrative Agent a security interest in such Collateral Account and all Cash Collateral therein. In
addition, and without limiting the foregoing or Section 2.5(d) , if any L/C Obligations remain outstanding (i) on the date
Lenders’ Commitments are cancelled or (ii) after the date that is 30 days before the Maturity Date (without in any way obligating
the Issuing Bank or any Lender to permit any Letter of Credit to remain outstanding after the date that is 30 days before the Maturity
Date), the Borrower shall immediately deposit into the Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to 105% of such L/C Obligations
as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
The Administrative Agent
shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the Collateral Account. Other than
any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent and at the Borrower’s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits,
if any, on such investments shall accumulate in the Collateral Account. Moneys in the Collateral Account shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for L/C Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed, together with related
fees, costs, and customary processing charges, and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement
obligations of the Borrower for the L/C Obligations at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject
to the consent of Lenders with L/C Obligations representing greater an 50% of the total L/C Obligations), be applied to satisfy
other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder
solely as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned
to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived unless such cash collateral
is otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement.
(m)          Letters of Credit
Issued for Account of Project Owners or Other Subsidiaries . Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder
is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Project Owner or other Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated
to reimburse the Issuing Bank hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges
that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Project Owners and Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrower,
and that the Borrower’s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Project Owners and Subsidiaries.

such determination (but in any event no later than the Extension Election Notice Date) and any Lender that does not so advise Administrative
Agent on or before the Extension Election Notice Date shall be deemed to be a Non-Extending Lender. The election of any Lender

Administrative Agent . Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower of each Lender’s determination under this Section no
later than the date 15 days prior to the annual anniversary of the Effective Date (or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the

Borrower shall have the right to cause each Non-Extending Lender to assign its Commitment to one or more Eligible Assignees (each,
an “ Additional Lender ”) as provided in Section 10.5 ; provided that each of such Additional
Lenders shall enter into an Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which such Additional Lender shall, effective as of the Extension
Effective Date, provide a Commitment (and, if any such Additional Lender is already a Lender, its additional Commitment shall be

to the Extension Effective Date (except that, if such date is not a Business Day, such Maturity Date as so extended shall be the
immediately preceding Business Day) and each Additional Lender shall thereupon become a “Lender” for all purposes of
this Agreement.

information so requested in connection with applicable “know your customer” and anti-money-laundering rules and regulations,
including the PATRIOT Act, in each case at least 10 days prior to the Extension Effective Date and (B) at least 10 days prior to
the Extension Effective Date, any Loan Party that qualifies as a “legal entity customer” under the Beneficial Ownership
Regulation shall have delivered, to each Lender that so requests, a Beneficial Ownership Certification in relation to such Loan
Party.
(iv)          On
the date of the notice described in Section 2.7(a) and the date of such extension and after giving effect thereto, (A) the representations
and warranties contained in the Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Extension Effective Date, except to the extent
that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such
earlier date, and (B) no Default or Event of Default exists or would result therefrom.
(g)          Amendment .
In connection with any extension of the Maturity Date, Borrower, Guarantors and Administrative Agent will execute such amendments
to this Agreement as Administrative Agent determines to be reasonably necessary to evidence the extension. This Section 2.7 shall
supersede any provisions in Section 10.2 to the contrary.
2.8           Noteless Agreement; Evidence
of Indebtedness .
(a)           Lender Accounts. 
Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of Borrower
to such Lender resulting from each Revolving Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and
interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
Field: Page; Sequence: 79; Value: 2

Field: /Page
(b)           Administrative
Agent Accounts . The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Revolving
Loan made hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from Borrower to
each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder from Borrower and each Lender’s
share thereof.
(c)           Evidence .
The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be prima facie 
evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided , however , that the failure of
the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation
of Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms.
(d)           Promissory Notes .
Any Lender may request that its Commitment be evidenced by a promissory note, substantially in the form of Exhibit E . In
such event, Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender such Note or Notes payable to the order of such Lender.
Thereafter, the Commitment evidenced by each such Note and interest thereon shall at all times (prior to any assignment pursuant
to Section 10.5 ) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the order of the payee named therein, except to the extent
that any such Lender subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Commitment once again be evidenced
as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) above.
(e)           Maximum Interest
Rate .
(i)              Highest
Lawful Rate . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Borrower shall not be obligated to pay,
and the Lenders shall not be entitled to charge, collect, receive, reserve, or take, interest (it being understood that “interest”
shall be calculated as the aggregate of all charges which constitute interest under applicable Law that are contracted for, charged,
reserved, received, or paid) in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate. During any period of time in which the interest rates specified
herein exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, interest shall accrue and be payable at such maximum rate; provided that, if the
interest rates decline below the Highest Lawful Rate, interest shall continue to accrue and be payable at the Highest Lawful Rate
(so long as there remains any unpaid principal with respect to the Revolving Loans) until the interest that has been paid equals
the amount of interest that would have been paid if interest had at all times accrued and been payable at the applicable interest
rates specified in this Agreement.
(ii)            Application
to Principal . If, for any reason, the Lenders receive anything of value as interest or anything deemed interest by applicable
Law under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or otherwise that results in the Lenders receiving interest in an amount
in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, the amount of such excess shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing
hereunder and not to the payment of interest. If the amount of such excess exceeds the unpaid principal balance of the Loan such
amount shall be refunded to Borrower.

Field: /Page
(iii)           Determination
of Rate . In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable with respect to the Loan exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate,
Borrower and the Lenders shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law: (A) characterize any non-principal payment as
an expense, fee, or premium rather than as interest; (B) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof; (C) amortize, prorate,
allocate, and spread the total amount of interest throughout the actual term of the Loan so that it does not exceed the maximum
amount permitted by applicable Law; or (D) allocate interest between portions of the Loan so that, to the greatest extent possible,
no such portion shall bear interest at a rate greater than the Highest Lawful Rate.
(iv)          Applicable
Law . For purposes of this Section 2.8 , the term “applicable Law” means the internal laws of the State of
Arizona, provided that, to the extent, contrary to the express intent of the parties, Arizona law is found to be inapplicable
to this Agreement, then “applicable Law” also means that law in effect from time to time and applicable to this loan
transaction which lawfully permits the charging and collection of the highest permissible, lawful, non-usurious rate of interest
on such loan transaction and this Agreement, and, to the extent controlling, laws of the United States of America.
(v)            Effective
Rate . Borrower hereby agrees to pay an effective, contracted-for rate of interest that is the interest rate provided for in
this Agreement (as in effect from time to time), together with any additional rate of interest resulting from any other charges
of interest or in the nature of interest paid or to be paid in connection with the Revolving Loans, including any fees to be paid
by Borrower pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents or the Fee Letter.
2.9            Lending
Installations . Each Lender may book its Revolving Loans
at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending Installation from time to time. All terms of this
Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Revolving Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be deemed
held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Administrative
Agent and Borrower, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through which Revolving Loans will be made by it
and for whose account Loan payments are to be made.
2.10          Increased
Costs .
(a)           Increased Costs
Generally . If any Change in Law shall:
(i)             impose,
modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets
of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender;
(ii)           subject
any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes and (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of
the definition of Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits,
reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii)           impose
on any Lender or the Issuing Bank any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made
by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
Field: Page; Sequence: 81; Value: 2

Field: /Page
and the result of any of the foregoing shall
be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Revolving
Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Revolving Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, the Issuing Bank
or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate
in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or other Recipient
hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or other Recipient, Borrower will
pay to such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or
other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)           Capital Requirements .
If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Installation of such Lender or such Lender’s
holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement,
the Commitments of such Lender or the Revolving Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s
holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the
policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower will pay to
such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such
reduction suffered.
(c)           Certificates for
Reimbursement . A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding
company, as the case may be, as specified in Sections 2.10(a) and (b) and delivered to Borrower, shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after
receipt thereof.
(d)           Delay in Requests .
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such
Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant
to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than sixty (60) days prior to the date that such Lender
notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender’s intention
to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive,
then the sixty (60) days referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
2.11          Taxes .
(a)           Defined Terms .
For purposes of this Section, the term “applicable Law” includes FATCA.
Field: Page; Sequence: 82; Value: 2
50
Field: /Page
(b)           Payments Free
of Taxes . Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without
deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Law. If any applicable Law (as determined in the good
faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by
a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely
pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and, if such
Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding
has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable
Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(c)           Payment of Other
Taxes by Borrower . Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at
the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
(d)           Indemnification
by Borrower . Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable
or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by a Lender (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.
(e)           Indemnification
by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor,
for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that Borrower has not already indemnified the
Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable
to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.5(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant
Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative
Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not
such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount
of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each
Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under
any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to
the Administrative Agent under this Section 2.11(e) .
(f)            Evidence of Payments .
As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing
such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent.
(g)           Status of Lenders .
Field: Page; Sequence: 83; Value: 2

Field: /Page
(i)            Any
Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document
shall deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will
permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably
requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably
requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not
such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set
forth in Sections 2.11(g)(ii)(A) , 2.11(g)(ii)(B) and 2.11(g)(ii)(D) ) shall not be required if in the Lender’s
reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense
or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii)            Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that Borrower is a U.S. Borrower,
(A)          any
Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or about the date on which such Lender becomes
a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or the Administrative Agent),
executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B)           any
Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such
number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under
this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever
of the following is applicable:
(1)            in
the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect
to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption
from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with
respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption
from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income”
article of such tax treaty;

(3)            in
the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x)
a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank”
within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of Borrower within the meaning of
Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” related to Borrower as described in Section
881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “ U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate ”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or
IRS Form W 8BEN-E; or
(4)            to
the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS
Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W 8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 or Exhibit
F-3 , IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if
the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio
interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 
on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C)           any
Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such
number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or about the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under
this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed
copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding
Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit Borrower or
the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
(D)           if
a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender
were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b)
of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed
by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by
applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested
by Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations
under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the
amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.11(g)(ii)(D) , “FATCA”
shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
Each Lender agrees that if any form
or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or
certification or promptly notify Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

(h)           Treatment of Certain
Refunds . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes
as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section),
it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under
this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such
indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount
paid over pursuant to this Section 2.11(h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 2.11(h) , in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to
an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.11(h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less
favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving
rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts
with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available
its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other
Person.
(i)            Survival .
Each party’s obligations under this Section shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any
assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or
discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
2.12         Illegality;
Inability to Determine Rates .
(a)           Illegality .
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted it is unlawful, for
any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loan advances whose interest is determined by reference to
Term SOFR, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell,
or to take deposits of, U.S. Dollars in the London interbank eurodollar market, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to Borrower
(through Administrative Agent), any obligation of such Lender to make or maintain advances of the Loan at the Term SOFR Rate shall
be suspended, in each case until such Lender notifies Administrative Agent and Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
determination no longer exist, in which case the Loans will accrue interest at the Base Rate. Upon receipt of such notice, all
Loans accruing interest based on the Term SOFR Rate will instead accrue interest at the Base Rate. Upon any such prepayment or
conversion, Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
(b)           Inability to Determine
Rates . If a Benchmark Replacement has not been implemented and Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining Term SOFR for proposed or
existing advances of the Loan, or (ii) Administrative Agent or Required Lenders determine that for any reason Term SOFR does not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Loan, Administrative Agent will promptly so notify Borrower
and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of Lenders to make or maintain advances of the Loan at the Term SOFR Rate shall be
suspended, in each case until Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by Required Lenders described in clause
(ii) above, until Administrative Agent upon instruction of Required Lenders) revokes such notice. During the period of such
suspension, all proposed advances and all amounts from day to day outstanding which are not past due, shall bear interest at a
fluctuating rate of interest per annum equal to the Base Rate.

2.13          Mitigation
Obligations; Replacement of Lenders .
(a)           Designation of
a Different Lending Installation . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.10 , or requires Borrower to pay
any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to such Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant
to Section 2.11 , then such Lender shall promptly upon becoming aware thereof use reasonable efforts to (i) designate a different
Lending Installation for funding or booking its Revolving Loans hereunder, (ii) assign its rights and obligations hereunder to
another of its offices, branches or affiliates, or (iii) take such other actions as such Lender may deem reasonable, if, in the
judgment of such Lender, such designation, assignment or other action (A) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
 Section 2.10 or 2.11 , as the case may be, in the future, and (B) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed
cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment or other remedial action.
(b)            Replacement of
Lenders . If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.10 , or if Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes
or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.11 
and, in each case, such Lender has, for any reason or for no reason, declined or is unable to remedy the circumstances giving rise
thereto in accordance with Section 2.13(a) , or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then Borrower
may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and
delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section
10.5 ), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights, if any, to payments pursuant to Section 2.10 or
 Section 2.11 ) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume
such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that:
(i)             Borrower
shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 10.5 ;
(ii)            such
Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Revolving Loans and participations in
L/C Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.10 ) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and
accrued interest and fees) or Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);

Field: /Page
(iii)           in
the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.10 or payments required to be made
pursuant to Section 2.11 , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;
(iv)          such
assignment does not conflict with applicable Law; and
(v)            in
the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented
to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
A Lender shall not be required to
make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances
entitling Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section
to the contrary, (A) any Lender that acts as an Issuing Bank may not be replaced hereunder at any time it has any Letter of Credit
outstanding hereunder unless arrangements satisfactory to such Lender (including the furnishing of a backstop standby letter of
credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer, reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank or the depositing of cash collateral
into a cash collateral account in amounts and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank) have been
made with respect to such outstanding Letter of Credit and (B) the Lender that acts as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced
hereunder except in accordance with the terms of Section 9.6 .
2.14          Increases
in Commitments .
(a)           Request for Increase .
Following the Effective Date, Borrower may, by notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall promptly notify the Lenders), request
an increase in the Commitments (each such increase, an “ Incremental Commitment ”) by an aggregate amount (for
all such requests) (x) such that the total Commitment Amount does not exceed $850,000,000 (subject to reduction as provided in
 Section 7.1(j) ); provided that any such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of the lesser of (A)
$20,000,000 (or such lesser amount as may be approved by the Administrative Agent) and (B) the entire remaining amount of increases
available under this Section, and (y) in the case of any Incremental Commitment that effectively replaces any Commitments terminated
pursuant to Section 2.13(b) , an amount equal to the portion of such Commitments so terminated.
(b)           Lender Elections
to Increase . Each Lender shall notify Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its
Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase
(each such existing Lender or other Person that agrees to provide an Incremental Commitment, an “ Incremental Lender ”).
Any Lender not responding within such time period required by Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have declined to increase
its Commitment.
(c)           Notification by
Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders . Administrative Agent shall notify Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders’
responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase and subject to the approval of Administrative
Agent and each Issuing Bank, Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement
in form and substance satisfactory to Administrative Agent and its counsel.

(d)           Effective Date
and Allocations . If the Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, Administrative Agent and Borrower shall
determine the effective date (the “ Incremental Commitment Effective Date ”) and the final allocation of such
increase. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the
Incremental Commitment Effective Date.
(e)           Conditions to
Effectiveness . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the increase in the Commitments pursuant to this Section shall not be effective
with respect to any Incremental Lender unless:
(i)             no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the Incremental Commitment Effective Date and after giving
effect to such increase;
(ii)            the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are true and correct on and as of the Incremental Commitment Effective
Date and after giving effect to such increase, as though made on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty
is expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date);
(iii)           the
Administrative Agent shall have received one or more Joinder Agreements contemplated above, providing for Incremental Commitments
in the amount of such increase;
(iv)          if
required by the Incremental Lender (subject to Borrower’s approval right pursuant to Section 2.12(b) ), Borrower shall
have paid the amount of attorneys’ fees incurred by Incremental Lender in connection with the Incremental Commitment; and
(v)           the
Administrative Agent shall have received such legal opinions and other documents reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent
in connection therewith.

other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Person or Lender agreeing to provide such Commitment, if any, and Administrative
Agent. Each Joinder Agreement may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect
the provisions of this Section. As of such Incremental Commitment Effective Date, upon the Administrative Agent’s receipt

(g)           Adjustments to
Outstanding Revolving Loans . On each Incremental Commitment Effective Date, (i) if there are Revolving Loans then outstanding,
each Incremental Lender shall make a payment to Administrative Agent in an amount sufficient, upon the application of such payments
by all Incremental Lenders to the reduction of the outstanding Revolving Loans held by each Lender, to cause the principal amount
outstanding under the Revolving Loans made by such Lender (including the Incremental Lender) to be in the amount of its Applicable
Percentage (upon the effective date of such Incremental Commitment, after giving effect to such Incremental Commitment) of all
outstanding Revolving Loans, and (ii) if there are Letters of Credit then outstanding, the participation of the Lenders in such
Letters of Credit will be automatically adjusted to reflect the Applicable Percentages of all the Lenders (including the Incremental
Lender) after giving effect to the applicable Incremental Commitment(s). Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes each Incremental
Lender to fund to Administrative Agent the payment required to be made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence for application
to the reduction of the outstanding Revolving Loans held by the other Lenders and each such payment shall constitute a Revolving
Loan hereunder.

as a further condition precedent to such issuance or extension) for the entire term of such Letter of Credit equal to 0.50% per
annum of the maximum amount that may at any time be available to be drawn thereon. In addition, if the stated amount of any Letter
of Credit is increased, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the L/C Fee on the
amount of the increase, which fee shall be due and payable on the date of the increase. Each L/C Fee paid to the Administrative
Agent shall be nonrefundable and fully earned as of the date paid.
(d)           Issuing Bank Fees .

(e)           Unused Fee .
Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, an unused
fee (the “ Unused Fee ”) on the average daily unused amount of the Commitment of such Lender for the period from
the Effective Date to the Maturity Date, at a rate equal to the applicable Unused Fee Rate. The Unused Fee shall be due and payable
in arrears (x) on the first Business Day after the end of each of March, June, September and December, and (y) on the Maturity
Date (or any earlier acceleration of the Obligations) , in each case for any period then ending for which the Unused Fee has not
previously been paid. For purposes of computing the Unused Fees, the Commitment of any Lender shall be deemed to be used to the
extent of the aggregate principal amount at such time of its outstanding Revolving Loans and such Lender’s participation
in L/C Obligations. The Unused Fee shall be calculated in arrears and if different Unused Fee Rates apply during any period of
calculation, the daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the applicable Unused Fee Rate for each period during which such
Unused Fee Rate was in effect.

of any Person other than the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Banks as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash
Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay
or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving

with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with
 Section 2.17 ; sixth , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank as a result of any judgment

by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this
Agreement; and eighth , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided 
that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Revolving Loans or L/C Disbursements in respect of which such
Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Revolving Loans were made or the related Letters of
Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be
applied solely to pay the Revolving Loans of, and L/C Disbursements owed to, all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior
to being applied to the payment of any Revolving Loans of, or L/C Disbursements owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time
as all Revolving Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance
with the Commitments without giving effect to clause (iv) below. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable
to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant
to this Section shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
(iii)           Fees .
(A)          No
Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commitment or other fees to which it would otherwise be entitled for any period
during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have
been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender, as determined by Administrative Agent). The foregoing shall not obligate
Administrative Agent to share any fees with any Lender or otherwise entitle any Lender to any fees except as expressly agreed in
writing between Administrative Agent and such Lender or as expressly provided in this Agreement.
(B)           Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive L/C Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting
Lender to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided
Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.17 .

Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with
respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender
pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to the Issuing Bank, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting
Lender to the extent allocable to the Issuing Bank’s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required

Field: /Page
(iv)           Reallocation
of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure . All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations
shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages (calculated without
regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause the aggregate
Revolving Loans of any Non-Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender’s Commitment. Subject to Section 10.19 ,
no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender
arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such
Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.
(v)            Cash
Collateral . If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall,
without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under law Cash Collateralize the Issuing Banks’ Fronting
Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.17 .
(b)           New Letters of
Credit . So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, extend, increase, reinstate
or renew any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.
(c)           Defaulting Lender
Cure . If Borrower and Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative
Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions
set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Revolving Loans of the
other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Loans
to be funded in accordance with the Commitments, whereupon, such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that
no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of Borrower while that
Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided , further , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the
affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any
party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
2.19         Erroneous
Payments .
(a)           If the Administrative
Agent notifies a Lender, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, (any such Lender or other recipient, a “ Payment
Recipient ”) that the Administrative Agent has determined in its reasonable discretion (whether or not after receipt of
any notice under immediately succeeding Section 2.19(b) ) that any funds received by such Payment Recipient from the Administrative
Agent or any of its Affiliates were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment
Recipient (whether or not known to such Lender, or other Payment Recipient on its behalf) (any such funds,
Field: Page; Sequence: 94; Value: 2
62
Field: /Page
whether received as
a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise, individually and collectively, an “ Erroneous
Payment ”) and demands the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment shall at all
times remain the property of the Administrative Agent and shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent, and such Lender shall (or, with respect to any Payment Recipient who received such funds on
its behalf, shall cause such Payment Recipient to) promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter, return to
the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made, in same
day funds (in the currency so received), together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such
Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative
Agent in same day funds at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in
accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect. A notice of the Administrative Agent
to any Payment Recipient under this Section 2.19(a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(b)           Without limiting
immediately preceding Section 2.19(a) , each Lender, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, hereby further
agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal,
interest, fees, distribution or otherwise) from the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different
amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative
Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied
by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates), or (z) that such Lender,
or other such recipient, otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) in
each case:
(i)              (A)
in the case of immediately preceding clauses (x) or (y), an error shall be presumed to have been made (absent written confirmation
from the Administrative Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error has been made (in the case of immediately preceding clause (z)),
in each case, with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment; and
(ii)           such
Lender shall (and shall cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all events,
within one Business Day of its knowledge of such error) notify the Administrative Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment
or repayment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
 Section 2.19(b) .
(c)           Each Lender hereby
authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan
Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender from any source, against any amount
due to the Administrative Agent under immediately preceding Section 2.19(a) or under the indemnification provisions of this
Agreement.

(d)           In the event that
an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by
the Administrative Agent in accordance with immediately preceding Section 2.19(a) , from any Lender that has received such
Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof)
on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an “ Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency ”), upon the Administrative
Agent’s notice to such Lender at any time, (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Revolving Loans (but not
its Commitments) with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the “ Erroneous Payment Impacted Class ”)
in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify) (such
assignment of the Revolving Loans (but not Commitments) of the Erroneous Payment Impacted Class, the “ Erroneous Payment
Deficiency Assignment ”) at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the Administrative
Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with the Borrower) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption
with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and such Lender shall deliver any Notes evidencing such Revolving
Loans to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, (ii) the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to acquire
the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender
shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease
to be a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its
obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such
assigning Lender and (iv) the Administrative Agent may reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Revolving Loans subject
to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Revolving Loans acquired
pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return
Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Loan (or portion thereof), and
the Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender (and/or against any recipient that
receives funds on its respective behalf). For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the
Commitments of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition,
each party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that the Administrative Agent has sold a Revolving Loan (or portion thereof)
acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent may be equitably
subrogated, the Administrative Agent shall be contractually subrogated to all the rights and interests of the applicable Lender
under the Loan Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (the “ Erroneous Payment Subrogation
Rights ”).
(e)           The parties hereto
agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower
or any other Loan Party, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of
such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower or any other Loan Party
for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment.
To
the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby
waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand,
claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including without limitation
waiver of any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine. Each party’s obligations, agreements
and waivers under this Section 2.19 shall survive the resignation or replacement
of the Administrative Agent, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations
(or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.

(n)           Use of
Proceeds; Margin Stock . The proceeds of the Revolving Loans will be used by Borrower solely for the purposes specified in this
Agreement. None of such proceeds will be used for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any “margin stock” as defined
in Regulation U or G of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 C.F.R. Part 221 and 207), or for the purpose of
reducing or retiring any indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry margin stock or for any other purpose
which might constitute this transaction a “purpose credit” within the meaning of such Regulation U or G. Borrower is
not engaged in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock. Neither Borrower nor any
Person acting on behalf of Borrower has taken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement or any other Loan Document
to violate Regulation U or G or any other regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to violate Section
7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or any rule or regulation thereunder, in each case as now in effect or as the same may
hereafter be in effect. Borrower and its subsidiaries own no “margin stock”.

(i)             Except
as could not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to cause a Material Adverse Change, (i) each Plan
is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other federal or state Laws and (ii) each Plan that is intended
to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS to the effect
that the form of such Plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and the trust related thereto has been determined by the
IRS to be exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the Code, or an application for such a letter is currently being
processed by the IRS, and, to the knowledge of Borrower, nothing has occurred that would prevent or cause the loss of such tax-qualified
status.
(ii)            There
are no pending or, to the knowledge of Borrower, threatened or contemplated claims, actions or lawsuits, or action by any Governmental
Authority, with respect to any Plan that, either individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to cause a Material
Adverse Change. There has been no prohibited transaction or violation of the fiduciary responsibility rules with respect to any
Plan that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.
(iii)           No
ERISA Event has occurred, and Borrower is not aware of any fact, event or circumstance that, either individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to constitute or result in an ERISA Event with respect to any Pension Plan that, either individually
or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to cause a Material Adverse Change.
(iv)           Except
as could not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to cause a Material Adverse Change, the present value
of all accrued benefits under each Pension Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Pension Plan) did not, as of the
last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets
of such Pension Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by a material amount. As of the most recent valuation date for each Multiemployer
Plan, the potential liability of Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate for a complete withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan (within
the meaning of Section 4203 or Section 4205 of ERISA), when aggregated with such potential liability for a complete withdrawal
from all Multiemployer Plans could not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to cause a Material Adverse
Change.

Loan Parties, their respective Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers and employees and, to the knowledge of Borrower,
the agents thereof, are in compliance with all applicable Sanctions and with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended,
and the rules and regulations thereunder (the “ FCPA ”) and any other applicable anti-corruption law, in all material

delivery by Borrower of financial statements, other documents, or information after the date of this Agreement (including, without

complete in all material respects as of the date thereof, and are based on Borrower’s best good faith estimates, compiled
and prepared with due diligence, of the matters set forth therein.

AGENCY
9.1            Appointment
and Authority . Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Western Alliance Bank to act
on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent
to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof
or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Except as otherwise provided in Section
 9.6(b), the provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, and Borrower shall
not have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent”
herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to
connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such
term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting
parties.

as a Lender . The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights
and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative
Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context
otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and
its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory
capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such
Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

Provisions .
(a)           The Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its
duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
(i)             shall
not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing;
(ii)            shall
not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed
in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein
or in the other Loan Documents); provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in
its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document
or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor
Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any
Debtor Relief Law; and
(iii)           shall
not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for
the failure to disclose, any information relating to Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the
Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
(b)           The Administrative
Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good
faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 8.1 and 10.2 ), or (ii) in the absence of
its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment.

made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other
document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of

not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other
writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any
statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any
liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Revolving Loan or the
issuance, extension, increase, reinstatement or renewal of a Letter of Credit that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction
of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of
such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel
for Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken
by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
9.5            Delegation
of Duties . The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights
and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative

by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and
to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection
with the syndication of the Loan as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible
for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a
final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection
of such sub-agents.

(a)           The Administrative

the Required Lenders shall have the right, upon approval by the Borrower if no Event of Default then exists, such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in Phoenix, Arizona, or an
Affiliate of any such bank with an office in Phoenix, Arizona. If no such successor shall have been appointed by the Required Lenders
as aforesaid and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice
of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “ Resignation Effective Date ”),
then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative
Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent
be a Defaulting Lender. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with
such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.
(b)           If the Person serving
as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may
and upon the request of the Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, by notice in writing to Borrower and such
Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, upon approval by the Borrower if no Event of Default then exists, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required
Lenders) (the “ Removal Effective Date ”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance
with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.
(c)           With effect from
the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall
be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (ii) except for any indemnity payments
owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to
or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment
as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring or
removed Administrative Agent), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and
obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall
be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between Borrower and such successor. After the retiring
or removed Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of
this Article and Section 10.4 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent,
its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while
the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.
9.7            Non-Reliance
on Agents and Other Lenders . Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties
and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions
in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document
furnished hereunder or thereunder.

Other Duties . Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no Person designated as an “arranger,”

this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender
hereunder.
9.9            Administrative
Agent May File Proofs of Claim . In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief
Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to Borrower or any other Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether
the principal of any Revolving Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise
and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but
not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
(a)           to file and prove
a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Revolving Loans, L/C Obligations
and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order
to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts
due the Lenders and the Administrative Agent under Section 10.4 ) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
(b)           to collect and receive
any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;
(c)           and any custodian,
receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized
by each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent
to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative
Agent under Section 10.4 .
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize
the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender.
9.10          Bank
Product Liability Arrangements . By reason of a Lender’s
execution of this Agreement or an Assignment and Assumption, as the case may be, any Affiliate of such Lender with whom any Loan
Party has entered into an agreement creating a Bank Product Liability shall be deemed a Lender party hereto for the purposes of
any reference in a Loan Document to the parties for whom the Administrative Agent is acting, it being understood and agreed that
the rights and benefits of such Affiliate under the Loan Document consist exclusively of such Affiliate’s right to share
in payments and collections out of the guaranty as more fully set forth in Section 8.7 . In connection with any such distribution
of payments and collections, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due to any Lender or its Affiliate
with respect to any Bank Product Liability unless such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent in writing of the amount of
any such liability owed to it or its Affiliate prior to such distribution.

such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption,
as of the “Trade Date”) shall not be less than $10,000,000, unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as

consent of Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (x) an Event of Default

Field: /Page
(B)           the
consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments
to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender.
(iv)           Assignment

to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.
(v)            No
Assignment to Certain Persons . No such assignment shall be made to (A) Borrower or any of Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries
or (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute
a Defaulting Lender or a Subsidiary thereof.
(vi)           No
Assignment to Natural Persons . No such assignment shall be made to a natural Person (or a holding company, investment vehicle
or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person).
(vii)          Certain
Additional Payments . In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such
assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the
assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution
thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other
compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share
of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby
irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative
Agent and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata
share of all Revolving Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any
assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance
with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes
of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
Subject to acceptance and recording
thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 10.5(c) , from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment
and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder
shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this
Agreement,
Field: Page; Sequence: 138; Value: 2
106
Field: /Page
such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10 
and 10.5 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided ,
that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute
a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender. Any assignment
or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated
for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section
10.5(d) .
(c)           Register .
The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Phoenix,
Arizona a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses
of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant
to the terms hereof from time to time (the “ Register ”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent
manifest error, and Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection
by Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d)           Participations .
Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to
any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary
benefit of, a natural Person, or Borrower or any of Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “ Participant ”)
in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment
and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii)
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the
indemnity under Section 10.5 with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s).
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument
may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described
in Section 10.2(c)(i) , (ii) or (iii) that affects such Participant. Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.10 and 2.11 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein,
including the requirements under Section 2.11(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.11(g) 
shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to Section 10.5(b) ; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section
2.12 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b ) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 2.10 or 2.11 , with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would
have been entitled to receive,
Field: Page; Sequence: 139; Value: 2
107
Field: /Page
except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law
that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at Borrower’s
request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.12(b) 
with respect to any Participant. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary
agent of Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and
stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “ Participant
Register ”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant
Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments,
loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure
is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section
5f.103-1(c) and Proposed Section 1.163-5(b) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register
shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register
as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant
Register.
(e)           Certain Pledges .
Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided 
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee
or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
10.6          Survival .
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by Borrower herein and in any Loan Document or other documents
delivered in connection herewith or therewith or pursuant hereto or thereto shall be considered to have been relied upon by the
other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof and the making of the Revolving Loans hereunder,
regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent
or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Revolving Loan, and shall continue in full force
and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall
remain outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or been terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.10, 2.11,
10.5, 10.16 and Article 9 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the payment in full of the Obligations, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments
or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent, constitute
the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings,
oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.1 , this Agreement shall become effective
when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts
hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or in electronic (e.g., “pdf” or “tif”) format shall
be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

(b)           Electronic Execution .
The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in any Loan Document
or any Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form,
each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based
recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable Law, including the Federal Electronic
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar
state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
10.8          Severability .
If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality,
validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or
impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision
in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section, if and to the extent that the enforceability
of any provision of this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good
faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provision shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.
10.9          Right
of Setoff . In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of the Lenders under applicable
Law, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, any and all deposits (including all account balances, whether provisional
or final and whether or not collected or available) and any other Indebtedness at any time owing by any Lender or any Affiliate
of any Lender to or for the credit or account of Borrower may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations owing
to such Lender, whether or not the Obligations, or any part thereof, shall then be due; provided, however, that no Lender will
exercise any right of setoff unless Administrative Agent consents to such exercise, or requires such exercise in Administrative
Agent’s sole and absolute discretion and any Lender that exercises a right of setoff without such consent or requirement
hereby agrees to indemnify Administrative Agent and each other Lender for, from and against any loss, liability, claims, damages,
costs and expenses arising from the exercise of such right of setoff.

10.17        Sharing
of Payments . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise,
obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements
or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving
Loans or participations in L/C Disbursements and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata

of such fact, and (2) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in L/C Disbursements

(a)           if any such participations
are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and
the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and

The Borrower consents to
the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation
pursuant to the foregoing arrangements subject to Section 10.9 , may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim
with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
10.18        Payments
Set Aside . To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of Borrower is made to the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Bank, or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, or any Lender exercises its right of setoff,
and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank, or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding
under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended
to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had
not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without

through a guarantee or otherwise, for Swap Contracts or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “ QFC
Credit Support ” and, each such QFC, a “ Supported QFC ”),
the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder,
the “ U.S. Special Resolution Regimes ”) in respect of such Supported
QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC
may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the

interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported
QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective
under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest,
Field: Page; Sequence: 147; Value: 2

under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against
such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S.
Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state
of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that any rights and remedies of the parties
with respect to the Lender if the Lender has failed to perform any of its obligations under the Loan Documents shall in no event
affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
