⟦s000802⟧ This calculation method results in a higher effective interest rate than the numeric interest rate stated in this Agreement.
⟦s000803⟧ By executing below, Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees to the calculation of interest in accordance with a year of 360 days and acknowledges that calculation of interest in accordance with this paragraph will increase the Loan’s effective interest rate above the stated Interest Rate and Default Rate, as applicable.

⟦s000992⟧ The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded; provided , however , that the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms.
⟦s000993⟧ (d) Promissory Notes .
⟦s000994⟧ Any Lender may request that its Commitment be evidenced by a promissory note, substantially in the form of Exhibit E .

⟦s000999⟧ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Borrower shall not be obligated to pay, and the Lenders shall not be entitled to charge, collect, receive, reserve, or take, interest (it being understood that “interest” shall be calculated as the aggregate of all charges which constitute interest under applicable Law that are contracted for, charged, reserved, received, or paid) in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate.
⟦s001000⟧ During any period of time in which the interest rates specified herein exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, interest shall accrue and be payable at such maximum rate; provided that, if the interest rates decline below the Highest Lawful Rate, interest shall continue to accrue and be payable at the Highest Lawful Rate (so long as there remains any unpaid principal with respect to the Revolving Loans) until the interest that has been paid equals the amount of interest that would have been paid if interest had at all times accrued and been payable at the applicable interest rates specified in this Agreement.
⟦s001001⟧ (ii) Application to Principal .
⟦s001002⟧ If, for any reason, the Lenders receive anything of value as interest or anything deemed interest by applicable Law under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or otherwise that results in the Lenders receiving interest in an amount in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, the amount of such excess shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing hereunder and not to the payment of interest.
⟦s001003⟧ If the amount of such excess exceeds the unpaid principal balance of the Loan such amount shall be refunded to Borrower.

⟦s001010⟧ For purposes of this Section 2.8 , the term “applicable Law” means the internal laws of the State of Arizona, provided that, to the extent, contrary to the express intent of the parties, Arizona law is found to be inapplicable to this Agreement, then “applicable Law” also means that law in effect from time to time and applicable to this loan transaction which lawfully permits the charging and collection of the highest permissible, lawful, non-usurious rate of interest on such loan transaction and this Agreement, and, to the extent controlling, laws of the United States of America.
⟦s001011⟧ (v) Effective Rate .
⟦s001012⟧ Borrower hereby agrees to pay an effective, contracted-for rate of interest that is the interest rate provided for in this Agreement (as in effect from time to time), together with any additional rate of interest resulting from any other charges of interest or in the nature of interest paid or to be paid in connection with the Revolving Loans, including any fees to be paid by Borrower pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Documents or the Fee Letter.

⟦s001027⟧ (b) Capital Requirements .
⟦s001028⟧ If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Installation of such Lender or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Revolving Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.

⟦s001032⟧ (d) Delay in Requests .
⟦s001033⟧ Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than sixty (60) days prior to the date that such Lender notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the sixty (60) days referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

⟦s001043⟧ (c) Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower .

⟦s001092⟧ Thereafter, the obligation of Lenders to make or maintain advances of the Loan at the Term SOFR Rate shall be suspended, in each case until Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by Required Lenders described in clause (ii) above, until Administrative Agent upon instruction of Required Lenders) revokes such notice.
⟦s001093⟧ During the period of such suspension, all proposed advances and all amounts from day to day outstanding which are not past due, shall bear interest at a fluctuating rate of interest per annum equal to the Base Rate.
