Below is a free‑form, sectioned analysis of the performance‑pricing constructs present in the excerpt. For each construct, I quote the governing language and then explain how it affects the borrower’s pricing (costs or savings), timing, and risk.

MANUAL SECTION NOTE
- The excerpt contains multiple duplications and cross‑references (e.g., several copies of similar definitions; references to Section numbers that appear incomplete). I highlight the pricing constructs as they appear and call out where ambiguities or missing data could affect pricing.

1) Leverage‑Based Margin Tiers (Applicable Margin; tiering by Total Leverage Ratio)

What the language says
- The core pricing construct is: “Applicable Margin means the applicable rate per annum set forth below, based on the Total Leverage Ratio as of the last day of each Measurement Period.” The table shows three pricing levels:
  - Tier I: Total Leverage Ratio ≥ 2.75 to 1.00; Base Rate Loans 7.25%, SOFR Loans 8.25%.
  - Tier II: Total Leverage Ratio < 2.75 to 1.00 and ≥ 2.25 to 1.00; Base Rate Loans 7.00%, SOFR Loans 8.00%.
  - Tier III: Total Leverage Ratio < 2.25 to 1.00; Base Rate Loans 6.75%, SOFR Loans 7.75%.
- In addition, there is a time‑band starter rule: “From the Closing Date until the date the Borrower delivers the financial statements, certificates and/or other information required to be delivered under Sections 6.1(b) and 6.2(a) for the Fiscal Quarter ending May 3, 2024, the Applicable Margin shall be conclusively presumed to equal the Applicable Margin specified in ‘Tier I’ of the pricing table set forth above.” Thereafter, margins are adjusted “quarterly upon delivery to Administrative Agent of the financial statements … accompanied by a Compliance Certificate with a written calculation of the Total Leverage Ratio.” If the calculation shows an increase or decrease, “on the first Business Day following” delivery, the Applicable Margin is adjusted accordingly.
- If the borrower fails to deliver required statements, “the Applicable Margin shall be conclusively presumed to equal the Applicable Margin specified in ‘Tier I’ … until the date of delivery … at which time the rate will be adjusted based upon the Total Leverage Ratio calculated pursuant to such financial statements.”

Explanation of pricing impact
- This is a classic leverage‑driven pricing ladder. The higher the Total Leverage Ratio (more debt relative to EBITDA), the higher the margin (7.25% base rate or 8.25% SOFR) to lenders; the lower the leverage, the cheaper the borrowing costs (down to 6.75% base for Base Rate Loans and 7.75% for SOFR Loans at Tier III).
- The borrower’s day‑to‑day cost of funds will swing with quarterly (post‑Closing) leverage updates. Timely financial reporting is essential: timely Compliance Certificates with a written Total Leverage Ratio calculation trigger an explicit margin adjustment on the next business day; late reporting leaves the borrower locked into Tier I (the highest cost tier in practice) until delivery and recalculation.
- The initial “Tier I” presumption provides a cushion right after Closing, but also creates a one‑way risk: if the company improves performance, margins can tighten (lower costs); if it worsens, margins rise.

2) Benchmark fallback/reset mechanics and Benchmark Replacement framework (Term SOFR; Replacement; Transition Events)

What the language says
- Benchmark: “Benchmark means, initially, the Term SOFR Reference Rate; provided that if a Benchmark Transition Event has occurred with respect to the Term SOFR Reference Rate or the then-current Benchmark, then ‘Benchmark’ means the applicable Benchmark Replacement to the extent that such Benchmark Replacement has replaced such prior benchmark rate pursuant to clause (a) of Section 2.14.”
- Benchmark Replacement: The first alternative that can be determined on the applicable date:
  - (a) Daily Simple SOFR; or
  - (b) the sum of: (i) the alternate benchmark rate selected by the Agent and the Borrower, plus (ii) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment.
  If the replacement would be below the Floor, the replacement is deemed to be the Floor.
- Benchmark Replacement Adjustment: The spread adjustment associated with the replacement.
- Benchmark Replacement Date: The date and time determined by the Agent, tied to the cessation or non‑representativeness of the current Benchmark.
- Benchmark Transition Event: The events that trigger a switch to a Replacement Benchmark (e.g., administrator ceases to provide tenors; IOSCO non‑compliance; etc.).
- Benchmark Unavailability Period; Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark: If a tenor is not available or not representative, the agreement allows conversion to Base Rate (and removal of the relevant Benchmark component from Base Rate calculations) during that period; Tenor removals can be reinstated if/when the tenor becomes available again.
- Conforming Changes: The Agent may implement conforming changes for the replacement benchmark without further party action.

Explanation of pricing impact
- The initial benchmark is Term SOFR, with the Margin (above) applied to SOFR Loans. If Term SOFR becomes unavailable or non‑representative, the contract automatically transitions to an alternate Benchmark Replacement (e.g., Daily Simple SOFR) and to an updated set of adjustments.
- The Shift to a Benchmark Replacement may change the Effective Yield of SOFR Loans by:
  - The replacement rate itself (e.g., Daily Simple SOFR vs. Term SOFR).
  - The Benchmark Replacement Adjustment component (a spread added to the replacement rate).
  The “Floor” provision ensures that, even if the replacement rate would otherwise be lower, the rate cannot fall below a floor if the adjustment would push it under the floor.
- The process is designed to avoid a funding gap if SOFR disappears, but it does mean that borrower pricing can move in response to market practice and regulator/administrator changes, potentially producing adverse pricing shifts during transitions.
- The explicit right to Conforming Changes and the ability to modify the Interest Period definitions ensures the lender group can maintain consistent economics during a transition, potentially affecting timing and complexity of interest accrual.

3) Timing‑based prepayment premiums or fees (Applicable Prepayment Premium)

What the language says
- “Applicable Prepayment Premium” means, with respect to prepayments of the principal of the Loan in connection with a Prepayment Event occurring prior to the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, a tiered premium:
  - (a) on or before 12 months after Closing Date: accrued interest to 12 months plus 3.00% of the prepaid amount;
  - (b) after 12 months but on or before 24 months: 2.00% of the prepaid amount;
  - (c) after 24 months but on or before 36 months: 1.00% of the prepaid amount;
  - (d) after 36 months but on or before 48 months: 0.50% of the prepaid amount.
- The premium is stated to apply in connection with various events that trigger prepayment: Change of Control; acceleration due to Event of Default; foreclosure and sale of collateral; insolvency proceedings; plan reorganization; or termination of the agreement for any reason (other than full repayment of obligations not constituting a Prepayment Event).

Explanation of pricing impact
- The prepayment premium increases the effective cost (or reduces the savings) of early repayment. The earlier the prepayment occurs, the higher the premium, which discourages early repayment and thus can lock the borrower into higher overall interest costs if they prepay.
- The premium schedule is explicitly tethered to high‑level “Prepayment Events,” including distress scenarios (Change of Control, insolvency, default, or termination). This adds a punitive cost in those scenarios, further raising the all‑in cost when exiting the facility under duress.
- Practically, this feature informs strategic decisions about debt refinancing, re‑capitalization, or exit timing, since early refinancing or repayment carries a material cost unless the market conditions are favorable or the “Repricing Event” (see below) is triggered.

4) Default rate and other cost‑changing clauses (Default Rate; Increased Costs; Illegality; Inability to Determine Rates; Taxes)

What the language says
- Interest tiers and default: “2.8 Interest” provides:
  - (a) SOFR Loans bear interest at Term SOFR for the applicable period plus the Applicable Margin; Base Rate Loans bear interest at Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.
  - (b) If any Event of Default exists, “the Agent may, and upon the request of the Required Lenders shall, notify the Borrower that all outstanding Obligations shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate … such Obligations shall bear interest at the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by Law; provided, that, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Sections 8.1(a) or (f) the Default Rate shall apply automatically.”
  - (c) Interest is due and payable in arrears on Interest Payment Dates, etc.
- Taxes; Tax Indemnities:
  - (a) “Payments … shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws,” and if withholding is required, amounts must be increased so that the Recipient receives the full amount as if no withholding occurred (Indemnified Taxes).
  - (b) The Borrower must pay Other Taxes.
  - (c) Tax Indemnifications: the Borrowers indemnify recipients for Indemnified Taxes; lenders indemnify agents and themselves for such taxes attributable to their own status.
- Increased Costs; Reserves on SOFR Loans:
  - (a) If a Change in Law increases the cost of making/maintaining SOFR Loans or the cost of reserves, the Borrower must pay such compensation to the affected Lender.
  - (b) If a Change in Law affects capital requirements, the Borrower must compensate the Lender for reduced returns.
  - (c) Certificates: Lenders may provide certificates detailing compensation; Borrower must pay within 10 days.
  - (d) Delay in Requests: delay in demand does not waive rights, but there is a six‑month lookback cap for retroactive increases (with retroactivity if retroactive changes occur).
- Inability to Determine Rates; Illegality:
  - (3.3) Inability to Determine Rates: if Term SOFR cannot be determined or fairly reflects funding cost, or if Term SOFR cannot be determined for any reason, the Lenders’ obligation to make/maintain SOFR Loans is suspended to the extent affected; the Base Rate component may also be suspended or adjusted.
  - (3.2) Illegality: if a Law makes it unlawful to make or fund SOFR Loans or to charge rates based on Term SOFR, then obligations to SOFR Loans are suspended or converted to Base Rate Loans at the Lender’s option; the Borrower may be required to prepay or convert such loans, and the Agent may adjust the Base Rate calculations to remove the Term SOFR component.

Explanation of pricing impact
- Default Rate: When an Event of Default occurs, borrowing costs rise sharply as the default rate applies automatically (and can be triggered by specified events). This materially increases the all‑in cost of debt during distress.
- Increased Costs: The lender cost of funds provisions (for reserve requirements, changes in law, taxes, etc.) can be passed through as additional charges to the borrower when changes in law or regulatory costs raise lender costs. This is a cost uplift that is not tied to performance alone; it’s a direct pass‑through of external costs.
- Taxes and Tax Indemnities: Withholding taxes or other tax liabilities can reduce the net proceeds to lenders unless grossed up by indemnities, increasing the borrower’s all‑in cost if tax treatment changes.
- Illegality/Inability to Determine Rates: If regulatory or legal changes occur that affect SOFR or the ability to fund SOFR loans, the agreement contemplates suspensions or conversions to Base Rate Loans, potentially with different base costs. This creates pricing risk tied to regulatory developments and market structure.
- Overall: These provisions ensure lenders are compensated for changes in costs or regulatory risk and provide a mechanism to adjust pricing outside of performance metrics, protecting lender economics in stressed or evolving conditions.

5) Repricing mechanics, ancillary fees, and related price protections (Repricing Event; Upfront Fee; Fees)

What the language says
- Repricing Event: “Repricing Event means, (i) any prepayment or repayment of the Term Loans, in whole or in part, with the proceeds of, or conversion of the Term Loans into, any new or replacement tranche of term loans bearing interest with an Effective Yield less than the Effective Yield applicable to the Term Loans (as such comparative yields are determined in the reasonable judgment of the Agent consistent with generally accepted financial practices) and (ii) any amendment to this Agreement that reduces the Effective Yield applicable to the Term Loans.”
- Upfront Fee: “The Borrower shall pay to the Agent an upfront fee in Dollars on the Closing Date in an amount equal to 3.00% of the principal amount of the Term Loans for the account of each Lender.”
- Other Fees: “The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter.”
- All such fees are stated to be fully earned when paid and non‑refundable.

Explanation of pricing impact
- Repricing Event provides a mechanism for potentially reducing the all‑in cost if the borrower can obtain refinance on more favorable terms or amend the agreement to achieve a lower yield. The pricing effect is a potential downward shift in yield if a lower‑yield tranche is obtained or the agreement is amended to grant a lower effective yield.
- Upfront Fees and ongoing fees increase the average cost of borrowing at closing and over the life of the loan. The 3% upfront charge is a substantial initial cost that lenders recover regardless of future performance.
- The combination of upfront and potential repricing events creates price dynamics that depend on capital markets, borrowing needs, and willingness to incur refi or amendment costs to secure lower ongoing interest margins.

6) Other pricing‑related covenants with direct pricing relevance (Financial covenants; minimum liquidity; default safeguards)

What the language says
- Financial covenants include:
  - Maximum Total Leverage Ratio (with a detailed table of various measurement periods and caps, e.g., May 3, 2024: 5.50:1.00; later dates with tiered changes; then down to around mid‑to‑late 2020s with lower targets like 4.50:1.00 or 4.75:1.00 in certain periods).
  - Minimum Liquidity: $50,000,000 (as of the last Business Day of each Fiscal Month).
- These covenants function as performance tests that can contribute to an Event of Default if violated.

Explanation of pricing impact
- While not a direct price number like a margin, these covenants influence pricing in practice: failure to meet them could trigger an Event of Default, leading to the Default Rate, and could also affect the willingness of lenders to fund at favorable margins. They indirectly shape the “pricing discipline” the borrower faces in the market by constraining leverage and liquidity.
- In practice, breaching these covenants may push lenders to demand higher pricing or reduce commitments; compliance reduces risk and can help maintain favorable pricing.

7) Missing data and ambiguities (closing “Notes” section)

Closing notes on data gaps and potential ambiguities that could affect pricing
- Floor for Term SOFR/Base Rate: The Base Rate calculation references “Floor” (in the Base Rate calculation and in the Term SOFR adjustments) but the numerical value of the Floor is not defined in the excerpt. This matters because it caps how low the rate can go even when SOFR is low.
- Exact EBITDA/Pro Forma mechanics and measurement periods: The Applicable Margin depends on the Total Leverage Ratio (Total Debt / Consolidated EBITDA) for a “Measurement Period.” The excerpt references pro forma effects and specified indebtedness but does not provide the exact EBITDA definitions, adjustments, or whether the measurement period is trailing twelve months, a calendar quarter, or another period. The practical pricing outcome depends on these definitions.
- Clarity around “Tier I” vs “Tier I” terminology: The table uses “Tier I,” but the text also refers to “Tier I of the pricing table set forth above.” The transition from Closing Date rules to quarterly adjustments requires precise mapping to Tier I, II, III; the closing notes should confirm which tier applies at each step and how to interpret “Tier I” in the Closing Date window.
- Repetition and cross‑references: The excerpt contains duplicated definitions (e.g., multiple copies of the Benchmark definitions, Base Rate definitions, etc.). The actual operative document should clarify which copy is authoritative and ensure there are no conflicting definitions or section numbers (e.g., references to Section 2.14 vs 2.14 appears inconsistently as 2.14, 14, etc.).
- Floor and floor‑related adjustments in the “Specified Indebtedness” notes: The “SOFR Adjustment” numbers appear in footnote style within a different section (e.g., “0.11448%” and “0.26161%” in the footnotes for “SOFR Adjustment”). It is unclear whether these are current statutory adjustments or typographical artifacts. The closing notes should confirm whether such specific adjustments apply to the SOFR replacement framework and how they interact with the applicable margin.
- Benchmark Replacement Date mechanics in practice: While the Definitions explain when a Benchmark Replacement Date occurs and how replacements are implemented (without amendment, or with notice after five Business Days for certain replacements if no objection from Required Lenders), real‑world pricing impact depends on the actual dates and the market’s replacement benchmark (Daily Simple SOFR vs. other alternatives) during a transition.
- Interaction of covenants with pricing terms: The detailed tables of leverage limits and liquidity thresholds imply potential future pricing dynamics if covenants are breached, but the exact mechanism by which these breaches feed back into pricing (e.g., automatic margin increase, cure periods, or gradual renegotiation) should be clarified in the core agreement.
- Data gaps for “Measurement Periods” and “Pro Forma Basis” terms: The sentence “Specified Indebtedness” and “Specified Transaction” definitions reference pro forma calculations without providing the precise pro forma rules or the base case. Clarification would help assess how such terms influence leverage ratios and thus pricing.
- Consistency of “Benchmark Transition Event” triggers: The text lists events that constitute a Benchmark Transition Event, but the alignment with IOSCO principles and with the administrator’s announcements in practice should be clarified to avoid disputes in a transition scenario.

Closing thoughts and suggested clarifications for drafting/closing
- Confirm the Floor value for Term SOFR/Base Rate adjustments and how it interacts with Term SOFR in both the Base Rate and SOFR components.
- Provide a clean, single set of definitions for Benchmark, Benchmark Replacement, and Benchmark Transition Event to avoid cross‑referencing ambiguities.
- Lock in the exact measurement period used for the Total Leverage Ratio (e.g., trailing twelve months vs. calendar quarter) and specify any adjustments (pro Forma) that impact the ratio.
- Clarify the exact interplay between Financial Covenants (leverage/liquidity) and pricing adjustments (whether breaches trigger automatic margin steps or are addressed through negotiations and waivers).
- Include a clean, consolidated note on all upfront/maintenance fees (upfront fee, fee letters) and any other potential costs (e.g., handling charges, legal fees, etc.) so the all‑in cost is transparent from closing.
- Ensure there is a single authoritative version of the document (no duplications or conflicting section numbers) and a clearly defined schedule for “Tier I/II/III” to prevent after‑closing disputes about the margin tier.

In short
- The main performance‑pricing constructs are the leverage‑based Applicable Margin (Tier I/II/III with quarterly re‑pricing), a comprehensive Benchmark/Replacement framework (Term SOFR, replacement rates, transition events, and related conforming changes), a tiered prepayment premium (timing‑based penalties), and several cost‑of‑fund/illegality/tax provisions that can adjust borrower costs outside of leverage movements. There are several ambiguities and drafting gaps in the closing notes that should be resolved to ensure predictable pricing and risk allocation.
