You are reading a segment of a credit/loan agreement. Each line begins with an anchor like [[s000123]].

Classify anchors into three buckets. List anchors only when the quoted text itself contains the requested signal.

(1) Fundamental anchors — capture core deal mechanics:
  • Effective/Closing dates and Maturity dates.
  • Borrower, Guarantor, Lender, Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent names.
  • Facility descriptions (type, amount/commitment, currency, purpose, borrowing mechanics, whether the facility is fixed vs. floating, references to SOFR/Base Rate elections, base-rate formulas, rate option descriptions).
  • Any clause defining whether loans may be SOFR/Base Rate, or otherwise explaining how interest type is determined.
  • Definitions immediately tied to those concepts (e.g., "Term Loan Commitment is $260,000,000" or "Term Loans may be Base Rate Loans or SOFR Loans").

(2) Pricing anchors — capture anything that determines economics:
  • Applicable Margin tables, pricing grids, tier definitions, references to leverage/utilization metrics that drive rates.
  • Base Rate / SOFR / benchmark formulas with numeric components, default-rate adders, interest rate floors, pricing level definitions, prepayment/call premiums, early termination fees, unused/commitment fees, upfront fees.
  • If any row in a table contains a number, include the anchors for the entire table (header + rows).

(3) Financial covenant anchors — capture maintenance tests or numeric limitations:
  • Leverage, coverage, liquidity, EBITDA, capex, or similar tests with numeric thresholds or tables.
  • Minimum cash, maximum leverage tables, ratio schedules, or any clause instructing to “not permit” a metric beyond a specific level.

Rules:
  • Omit baskets, qualitative covenants, or other provisions with no numeric test.
  • Do not duplicate an anchor across buckets unless the text truly covers both (rare).
  • Output unique anchors per bucket ordered as they appear in the document.

Return JSON only:
{
  "fundamental_anchors": ["s000123", ...],
  "pricing_anchors": ["s000456", ...],
  "financial_covenant_anchors": ["s000789", ...]
