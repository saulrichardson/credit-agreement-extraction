You are reading a segment of a loan agreement.
Each line begins with an anchor [[sXXXXX]].

List every anchor whose text contains numeric pricing information.

- Include anchors that contain:
- Interest rates
- Applicable Margins
- Spreads
- Performance pricing grids
- Pricing levels or pricing tiers
- Any percentage or numeric rate used to determine interest
- Base Rate formulas containing numeric components
- Default Rate percentages
- Prepayment premiums or call protection percentages

Do NOT include:

- Definitions of terms that contain no numbers
- Text that only describes how variables are defined
- Any covenants that do not directly impact loan pricing or margins

Examples (for guidance only):
[[s00234]] “Applicable Margin for SOFR Loans is 8.25%.”
[[s00235]] “Pricing Level I: 7.25% for Base Rate Loans.”
[[s00236]] “Prepayment Premium: 3.00%.”

You must also indicate whether the loan agreement contains performance pricing, meaning any pricing levels or grids that vary with financial ratios, performance measures, total leverage ratios, or similar metrics.

Return JSON in this format:
{
"anchors": ["sXXXXX", "sYYYYY", ...],
"has_performance_pricing": true
}

If no performance pricing is found, return:
{
"anchors": [...],
"has_performance_pricing": false
}

Output only valid JSON. Do not include explanations or text outside the JSON.
