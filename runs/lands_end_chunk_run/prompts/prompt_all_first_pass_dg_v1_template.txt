You are reading a segment of a loan agreement.
Each line begins with an anchor [[sXXXXX]].

Your task is to classify anchors into three categories. For each category, list only the anchors whose text directly contains the relevant information.

(1) Fundamental information:
Include anchors that contain core deal terms such as the active/closing date, maturity date, loan facilities, committed amounts, currencies, fixed vs. floating rate type, borrowing mechanics, loan types, and other basic structural information about the credit facility.
Do NOT include any pricing tiers, performance pricing grids, or covenants.

(2) Pricing-related information:
List every anchor whose text includes a numeric interest rate, margin, spread, base rate definition containing numeric components, or any percentage from a performance pricing grid.
Include all anchors that are part of such a table or grid if any line in it contains a number.
Ignore definitions of terms or formulas that do not themselves contain numeric pricing.

(3) Financial covenant–related information:
List anchors that contain numeric or formula-based financial maintenance tests (for example, leverage ratios, fixed charge coverage ratios, minimum liquidity, maximum capex, minimum EBITDA, etc.).
Ignore covenants that are purely operational or qualitative and contain no numeric or financial-ratio requirement.

Return your output as JSON only, in this format:

{
"fundamental_anchors": ["sXXXXX", "sYYYYY", ...],
"pricing_anchors": ["sAAAAA", "sBBBBB", ...],
"financial_covenant_anchors": ["sCCCCC", "sDDDDD", ...]
}

Output only valid JSON. Do not include explanations or any text outside the JSON.
