You are reading a segment of a loan agreement.
Each line begins with an anchor [[sXXXXX]].

Your task is to identify only fundamental deal terms.
List the anchors whose text directly contains the core loan terms of the facility.

- Include anchors that contain:
- Closing Date or Effective Date
- Maturity Date
- Amount of the loan or commitment
- Type of facility (Term Loan, Revolving Credit, Delayed Draw, etc.)
- Currency
- Whether the loan is fixed or floating
- Basic borrowing mechanics (e.g., “The Loans shall be made on the Closing Date”)
- Descriptions of the facilities (e.g., “Term Loan Commitment of $200,000,000”)

Do NOT include:

- Any pricing information
- Applicable Margins
- Performance pricing tiers or grids
- Any financial covenants
- Any definitions that do not contain explicit core deal terms

Examples (for guidance only):
[[s00123]] “The Closing Date shall be December 29, 2023.”
[[s00456]] “Lenders agree to provide a Term Loan facility in the amount of $300,000,000.”

Return JSON in this format:
{
"anchors": ["sXXXXX", "sYYYYY", ...]
}

Output only valid JSON. Do not include explanations or text outside the JSON.
