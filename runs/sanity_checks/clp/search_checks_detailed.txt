actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the administrative agent in its capacity as such in any way relating to or arising out of any loan document or any action taken or omitted by the administrative agent in its capacity as such under any loan document, provided that no lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the administrative agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. without limitation of the foregoing, each lender agrees to reimburse the administrative agent promptly upon demand for such lender's ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the administrative agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement

agent may, on behalf of the lenders, appoint a successor administrative agent, which shall be lender or shall be another commercial bank or trust company organized or licensed under the laws of the united states or of any state thereof reasonably acceptable to the borrowers. in addition to the foregoing right of the administrative agent to resign, the majority lenders may remove the administrative agent at any time, with or without cause, concurrently with the appointment by the majority lenders of a successor administrative agent. upon the acceptance of any appointment as administrative agent hereunder by a successor administrative agent, such successor administrative agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring administrative agent, and the retiring administrative agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this agreement. after any retiring administrative agent's
