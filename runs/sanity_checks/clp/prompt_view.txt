⟦s000200⟧ (e) a participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under sections 4.03 and 4.05 than the applicable lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such participant, unless the sale of the participation to such participant is made with each borrower's prior written consent. a participant that is not incorporated under the laws of the united states of america or any state thereof shall not be entitled to the benefits of section 4.05 unless the borrowers are notified of the participation sold to such participant and such participant agrees, for the benefit of the borrowers, to comply with section 4.05(e) as though it were a lender.
⟦s000201⟧ (f) any lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this agreement to secure obligations of such lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a federal reserve bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such lender as a party hereto.
⟦s000202⟧ (g) if any lender shall have delivered a notice to the administrative agent described in section 4.03(a), (b), (c) or (f) hereof, or shall become a non-performing lender under section 3.03(b) hereof, and if and so long as such lender shall not have withdrawn such notice or corrected such non-performance in accordance with section 3.03(b), the borrowers may demand that such lender assign, in accordance with section 10.07 hereof, to one or more assignees designated by either the borrowers or the administrative agent (and reasonably acceptable to the other), all (but not less than all) of such lender's commitment, advances, participation and other rights and obligations under the loan documents; provided that any such demand by the borrowers during the continuance of an event of default or an unmatured default shall be ineffective without the consent of the majority lenders. if, within 30 days following any such demand by the borrowers, any such assignee so designated shall fail to tender such assignment on terms reasonably satisfactory to the borrowers and the borrowers and the administrative agent shall have failed to designate any such assignee, then such demand by the borrowers shall become ineffective, it being understood for purposes of this provision that such assignment shall be conclusively deemed to be on terms reasonably satisfactory to such lender, and such lender shall be compelled to tender such assignment forthwith, if (i) such assignee (a) shall agree to such assignment in substantially the form of the lender assignment and (b) shall tender payment to such lender in an amount equal to the full outstanding dollar amount accrued in favor of such lender hereunder (as computed in accordance with the records of the administrative agent) and (ii) in the event the borrowers demanded such assignment, the borrowers shall tender payment to the administrative agent of the processing and recording fee specified in section 10.07(b) for such assignment. section 10.08. confidentiality. in connection with the negotiation and administration of the loan documents, the borrowers have furnished or caused to have furnished and will from time to time furnish or cause to be furnished to the administrative agent and the lenders (each, a "recipient") written information which when delivered to the recipient will be deemed to be confidential (such information, other than any such information which (i) was publicly available, or otherwise known to the recipient, at the time of disclosure, (ii) subsequently becomes publicly available other than through any act or omission by the recipient or (iii) otherwise subsequently becomes known to the recipient other than through a person whom the recipient knows to be acting in violation of his or its obligations to the borrowers, being hereinafter referred to as "confidential information"). the recipient will not knowingly disclose any such confidential information to any third party (other than to those persons who have a confidential relationship with the recipient), and will take all reasonable steps to restrict access to such information in a manner designed to maintain the confidential nature of such information, in each case until such time as the same ceases to be confidential information or as the borrowers may otherwise instruct. it is understood, however, that the foregoing will not restrict the recipient's ability to freely exchange such confidential information with prospective participants in or assignees of the recipient's position herein, but the recipient's ability to so exchange confidential information shall be conditioned upon any such prospective participant's entering into an understanding as to confidentiality similar to this provision. it is further understood that the foregoing will not prohibit the disclosure of any or all confidential information if and to the extent that such disclosure may be required (i) by a regulatory agency or otherwise in connection with an examination of the recipient's records by appropriate authorities, (ii) pursuant to court order, subpoena or other legal process or (iii) otherwise, as required by law; in the event of any required disclosure under clause (ii) or (iii), above, the recipient agrees to use reasonable efforts to inform the borrowers as promptly as practicable unless the lender is prohibited from doing so by court order, subpoena or other legal process. notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto (and each officer, director, employee, representative, agent and advisor of each party hereto) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" (in each case within the meaning of treasury regulation section 1.6011-4) of the transactions contemplated by the loan documents and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such person relating to such "tax treatment" and "tax structure". the foregoing is intended to comply with the presumption set forth in treasury regulation section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(iii) and should be interpreted in a manner consistent with such regulation. section 10.09. waiver of jury trial. each of the borrowers, the administrative agent and the lenders hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to the loan documents, or any other instrument or document delivered hereunder or thereunder. section 10.10. governing law. the loan documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of new york. each of the borrowers, the lenders and the administrative agent: (i) irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of any new york state court or federal court sitting in new york city in any action arising out of or relating to the loan documents, (ii) agrees that all claims in such action may be decided in such court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum and (iv) consents to the service of process by mail. a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions. nothing herein shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any manner permitted by law or affect its right to bring any action in any other court. section 10.11. relation of the parties;
