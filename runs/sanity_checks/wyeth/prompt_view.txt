⟦s000186⟧ (b) in the event that the administrative agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the company) that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the eurodollar rate for any interest period with respect to a proposed bid loan to be made pursuant to an index rate bid loan request, the administrative agent shall forthwith give telephone notice of such determination, confirmed in writing, to the company and the bid loan lenders at least two business days prior to the proposed bid loan date, and such bid loans shall not be made on such bid loan date. until any such notice has been withdrawn by the administrative agent, no further index rate bid loan requests shall be submitted by the company.
⟦s000187⟧ 2.14 illegality. notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, if the adoption of or any change in any requirement of law or in the interpretation or application thereof by any relevant governmental authority to any lender shall make it unlawful for such lender to make or maintain eurodollar loans as contemplated by this agreement or to obtain in the interbank eurodollar market the funds with which to make such loans, (a) such lender shall promptly notify the administrative agent and the company thereof, (b) the commitment of such lender hereunder to make eurodollar loans or continue eurodollar loans as such shall forthwith be cancelled and (c) such lender's committed rate loans then outstanding as eurodollar loans, if any, shall be converted on the last day of the interest period for such loans or within such earlier period as required by law into alternate base rate loans. the company hereby agrees promptly to pay any lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such lender for actual and direct costs reasonably incurred by such lender in making any repayment in accordance with this subsection including, but not limited to, any interest or fees payable by such lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its eurodollar loans hereunder. a certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this subsection submitted by such lender, through the administrative agent, to the company shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. each lender agrees to use reasonable efforts to avoid or to minimize any amounts which may otherwise be payable pursuant to this subsection; provided, however, that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on such lender of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by such lender to be material.
⟦s000188⟧ 2.15 requirements of law.
⟦s000189⟧ (a) if the adoption of or any change in any requirement of law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other governmental authority made subsequent to the date hereof: (i) does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such lender which are not otherwise covered by subsection 2.15(b); or (ii) does or shall impose on such lender any other condition; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such lender of making or maintaining loans or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder, then, in any such case, the company shall promptly pay such lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such lender for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable which such lender reasonably deems to be material as determined by such lender with respect to its eurodollar loans; provided however, that the company shall have no obligation under this subsection 2.15 to pay such lender any additional amounts with respect to any such additional cost or reduced amount receivable resulting from taxes addressed in subsection 2.17. a certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this subsection submitted by such lender, through the administrative agent, to the company shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. each lender agrees to use reasonable efforts to avoid or to minimize any amounts which might otherwise be payable pursuant to this paragraph of this subsection; provided, however, that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on such lender of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by such lender to be material.

⟦s000253⟧ (a) this agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the company, the lenders, the administrative agent and their respective successors and assigns, except that the company may not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this agreement without the prior written consent of each lender.
⟦s000254⟧ (b) any lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("participants") participating interests in any loan owing to such lender, any commitment of such lender, or any other interest of such lender hereunder. in the event of any such sale by a lender of participating interests to a participant, such lender's obligations under this agreement to the other parties to this agreement shall remain unchanged, such lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance thereof and the company and the administrative agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such lender in connection with such lender's rights and obligations under this agreement. no lender shall transfer or grant any participation under which the participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of this agreement except to the extent such amendment or waiver would (i) extend the scheduled maturity of any loan in which such participant is participating, or reduce the stated rate or extend the time of payment of interest or facility fees thereon (except in connection with a waiver of interest at the increased post-default rate) or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase the amount of the participant's participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any default or event of default shall not constitute a change in the terms of such participation, and that an increase in any commitment or loan shall be permitted without consent of any participant if the participant's participation is not increased as a result thereof) or (ii) consent to the assignment or transfer by the company of any of its rights and obligations under this agreement. in the case of any such participation, the participant shall not have any rights under this agreement (the participant's rights against such lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by such lender in favor of the participant relating thereto) and all amounts payable by the company hereunder shall be determined as if such lender had not sold such participation, provided that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of subsections 2.15, 2.16 and 8.5 with respect to its participation in the commitments and the loans outstanding from time to time; provided that no participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such subsections than the transferor lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor lender to such participant had no such transfer occurred.
⟦s000255⟧ (c) any lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell, pursuant to a commitment transfer supplement, to (i) any lender or any affiliate thereof all or any part of its rights and obligations under this agreement, and (ii) with the consent of the administrative agent and, so long as no default or event of default under section 6(a) or (e) is then in existence, the company (in each case, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to one or more additional banks or financial institutions ("purchasing lenders"), all or any part of its rights and obligations under this agreement, in the case of the aforementioned clause (ii), in minimum amounts of $10,000,000 (or, if less, the entire amount of such lender's obligations) so long as, in the case of each of the aforementioned clauses (i) and (ii) hereof, after giving effect thereto, the remaining commitment of such selling lender, shall not be less than $10,000,000, unless such selling lender has not retained any commitment hereunder, and a commitment transfer supplement has been executed by such purchasing lender, such transferor lender (and, in the case of a purchasing lender that is not then a lender or an affiliate thereof, by the company and the administrative agent), and delivered to the administrative agent for its acceptance and recording in the register. upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the transfer effective date specified in such commitment transfer supplement, (x) the purchasing lender thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such commitment transfer supplement, have the rights and obligations of a lender hereunder with a commitment as set forth therein, and (y) the transferor lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such commitment transfer supplement, be released from its obligations under this agreement (and, in the case of a commitment transfer supplement covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor lender's rights and obligations under this agreement, such transferor lender shall cease to be a party hereto). such commitment transfer supplement shall be deemed to amend this agreement to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such purchasing lender and the resulting adjustment of commitment percentages arising from the purchase by such purchasing lender of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor lender under this agreement.
⟦s000256⟧ (d) the administrative agent shall maintain at its address referred to in subsection 8.2 a copy of each commitment transfer supplement delivered to it and a register (the "register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the lenders and the commitment of, and principal amount of the loans owing to, each lender from time to time. the entries in the register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the company, the administrative agent and the lenders may treat each person whose name is recorded in the register as the owner of the loan recorded therein for all purposes of this agreement. the register shall be available for inspection by the company or any lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
⟦s000257⟧ (e) upon its receipt of a commitment transfer supplement executed by a transferor lender and a purchasing lender (and, in the case of a purchasing lender that is not then a lender or an affiliate thereof, by the company and the administrative agent) together with payment to the administrative agent (by the transferor lender or the purchasing lender, as agreed between them) of a registration and processing fee of $3,500 for each purchasing lender listed in such commitment transfer supplement, the administrative agent shall (i) accept such commitment transfer supplement, (ii) record the information contained therein in the register and (iii) give prompt notice of such acceptance and recordation to the lenders and the company.
⟦s000258⟧ (f) the company authorizes each lender to disclose to any participant or purchasing lender (each, a "transferee") and any prospective transferee any and all financial information in such lender's possession concerning the company and its affiliates which has been delivered to such lender by or on behalf of the company pursuant to this agreement or which has been delivered to such lender by or on behalf of the company in connection with such lender's credit evaluation of the company and its affiliates prior to becoming a party to this agreement; in each case subject to subsection 8.14.
⟦s000259⟧ (g) at the time of each assignment pursuant to this subsection 8.6 to a person which is not already a lender hereunder and which is not a united states person (as such term is defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the code) for federal income tax purposes, the respective assignee lender shall provide to the company and the administrative agent the appropriate internal revenue service forms (and, if applicable, a 2.17 certificate) described in subsection 2.17.

⟦s000262⟧ (a) each lender agrees that if any lender (a "benefited lender") shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its committed rate loans, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in clause (e) of section 6, or otherwise) in a greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other lender, if any, in respect of such other lender's committed rate loans, or interest thereon (except as expressly provided in subsection 2.18), such benefited lender shall purchase for cash from the other lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other lender's committed rate loan, or shall provide such other lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefited lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefited lender, such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. the company agrees that each lender so purchasing a portion of another lender's committed rate loan may exercise all rights of payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as if such lender were the direct holder of such portion.
⟦s000263⟧ (b) in addition to any rights and remedies of the lenders provided by law (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off), each lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the company, any such notice being expressly waived by the company to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon the occurrence of any event of default, to setoff and appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the company, or any part thereof in such amounts as such lender may elect, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of the company to such lender hereunder and claims of every nature and description of such lender against the company, in any currency, whether arising hereunder, under the loans or under any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein, as such lender may elect, whether or not such lender has made any demand for payment and although such obligations, liabilities and claims may be contingent or unmatured. the aforesaid right of set-off may be exercised by such lender against the company or against any trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of the company, or against anyone else claiming through or against the company or any such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not have been exercised by such lender prior to the occurrence of any event of default. each lender agrees promptly to notify the company and the administrative agent after any such set-off and application made by such lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
