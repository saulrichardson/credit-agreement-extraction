representations and warranties contained in the Loan Documents, each Lender
severally agrees to make revolving credit Loans to the Borrower from time to
time until the Termination Date, provided that in no event shall the Aggregate

Commitment. Until the Termination Date, the Borrower may use the Available
Commitments by borrowing, prepaying the Loans in whole or in part, and
reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.

- The Loans may from time to time be (i) Eurodollar Loans, (ii) ABR Loans
or (iii) a combination thereof, as determined by the Borrower and notified to
the Administrative Agent in accordance with Sections 2.3 and 4.5, provided that
no Loan shall be made as a Eurodollar Loan after the day that is one month prior
to the Termination Date.

2.2 Notes. In order to evidence the Loans, the Borrower will execute and
deliver to each Lender a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit H,
with appropriate insertions as to payee, date and principal amount (each, as
amended, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified from time to time, a
"Note"), payable to the order of each Lender and in a principal amount equal to
each such Lender's Commitment. Each Note shall (x) be dated the Effective Date
or the date of any reissuance of such Note, (y) be stated to mature on the
Termination Date and (z) provide for the payment of interest in accordance with
Section 4.1.

2.3 Procedure for Borrowing. Subject to the terms and conditions contained
in the Loan Documents, the Borrower may borrow under the Available Commitments,
prior to the Termination Date, on any Business Day by delivery to the
Administrative Agent of an irrevocable notice substantially in the form of
Exhibit I-1 (a "Notice of Borrowing"). A Notice of Borrowing must be received by
the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 A.M., Dallas, Texas time, (a) three
Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date, if all or any part of the
requested Loans are to be initially Eurodollar Loans, or (b) on the requested
Borrowing Date. A Notice of Borrowing shall specify (i) the amount to be
borrowed, (ii) the requested Borrowing Date, (iii) whether the borrowing is to
be of Eurodollar Loans, ABR Loans or a combination thereof and (iv) if the
borrowing is to be entirely or partly of Eurodollar Loans, the respective
amounts of each Tranche and the respective lengths of the initial Interest
Periods therefor. Each borrowing under the Total Available Commitment shall be
in an amount equal to (x) in the case of ABR Loans, $5,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if the then Total Available
Commitment is less than $5,000,000, such lesser amount) and (y) in the case of
Eurodollar Loans, $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof. Upon receipt of any such Notice of Borrowing from the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. Each such Lender
will make the amount of its pro rata share of each borrowing available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at the office of the
Administrative Agent specified in Section 12.2 prior to 1:00 P.M., Dallas, Texas
time, on the Borrowing Date requested by the Borrower in funds immediately
available to the Administrative Agent. Such borrowing will then be made
available to

21

28

the Borrower by the Administrative Agent crediting the account of the Borrower
as so directed by the Borrower in a Notice of Borrowing with the aggregate of
the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by the Lenders and in
like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.

2.4 Unavailable Commitment. On the Effective Date, the Borrower may give
the Administrative Agent notice designating (a "Designation Notice") up to a
maximum principal amount of $200,000,000 of the Total Commitment, in increments
of $25,000,000, as being unavailable for borrowing (the total of all such
designated amounts at any time being herein referred to as the "Unavailable
Commitment"). In no event may the Borrower designate an amount as unavailable
for borrowing after the Effective Date or if, after giving effect to the
applicable Designation Notice, the Aggregate Outstandings of Credit of all the
Lenders would exceed the Total Available Commitment. At any time until the date
which is the second anniversary of the Effective Date, the Borrower may
redesignate all or any portion of the Unavailable Commitment as available for
borrowing or the issuance of Letters of Credit by giving the Administrative
Agent notice (a "Redesignation Notice") specifying the amount, in increments of
$25,000,000, of the Unavailable Commitment which shall again be available for
borrowing. The amount so specified in the Redesignation Notice shall be
available for borrowing on the date which is three Business Days after the
Administrative Agent's receipt of such Redesignation Notice; provided, however,
that for purposes of Section 4.3 such Redesignation Notice shall be deemed to be
effective as of the date which is 90 days prior to the date of such
Redesignation Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
on the date which is the second anniversary of the Effective Date the amounts,
if any, remaining designated as the Unavailable Commitment shall be deemed to be
available for borrowing or the issuance of Letters of Credit on such date
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

unpaid principal amount of each Loan of such Lender, on the Termination Date (or

Section 4.2. The Borrower hereby further agrees to pay interest on the unpaid
principal amount of the Loans from time to time outstanding from the date hereof

forth in Section 4.1.

- Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an

Section 12.6(g), and a subaccount therein for each Lender, in which shall be
recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and each
Interest Period, if any, applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower

22

29

to each Lender hereunder and (iii) both the amount of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share
thereof.

- The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Lender
maintained pursuant to Section 12.6(g) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the
obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however, that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or
any such account, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the
obligation of the Borrower to repay (with applicable interest) the Loans made to
the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 3. LETTERS OF CREDIT

3.1 L/C Commitment. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Issuing
Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in Section
3.4(a), agrees to issue letters of credit ("Letters of Credit") for the account
of the Borrower on any Business Day in such form as may be approved from time to
time by such Issuing Lender; provided that Issuing Lender shall not issue any
Letter of Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, either (i) the L/C
Obligations would exceed the lesser of (x) $30,000,000 or (y) the Total
Available Commitment or (ii) the Aggregate Outstandings of Credit of all the
Lenders would exceed the Total Available Commitment. Each Letter of Credit shall
- be denominated in Dollars and shall be either (x) a standby letter of credit
issued for the account of the Borrower, which finances the working capital and
business needs of the Borrower and/or the Subsidiaries of the Borrower,
including, without limitation, good faith deposits in connection with permitted
acquisitions by the Borrower and/or the Subsidiaries of the Borrower, or (y) a
commercial letter of credit issued for the account of the Borrower in respect of
the purchase of goods or services by the Borrower and/or any of the Subsidiaries
of the Borrower and (ii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the Termination
Date and (y) the date which is 12 months after its date of issuance.

- Each Letter of Credit shall be subject to the Uniform Customs and, to
the extent not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of Texas.

- The Issuing Lender shall not at any time be obligated to issue any
Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance would conflict with, or cause the
Issuing Lender or any other Lender to exceed any limits imposed by, any
applicable Requirement of Law.

3.2 Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit. The Borrower may from time
to time request that the Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering
to the Issuing Lender, at its address for notices specified herein, an
Application therefor, completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the Issuing
Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information
as the Issuing Lender may reasonably request. Upon receipt of any Application,
the Issuing Lender will process such Application and the certificates, documents
and other papers and information delivered to it in connection therewith in
accordance with its customary procedures and

23

30

shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby (but in no event
shall the Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than
three Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such
other certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto)
by issuing the original of such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or
as otherwise may be agreed by the Issuing Lender and the Borrower. The Issuing
Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the Borrower promptly
following the issuance thereof.

3.3 Fees, Commissions and Other Charges. (a) The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of each Lender, a letter of credit fee
with respect to each Letter of Credit, computed for the period from and
including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to the date such Letter
of Credit is no longer outstanding, computed at a percentage rate per annum
equal to the Applicable Margin from time to time applicable to Loans bearing
interest at the Eurodollar Rate, calculated on the basis of a 360-day year, of
the aggregate average daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of
Credit for the period as to which payment of such fee is made, payable on each
L/C Fee Payment Date to occur while such Letter of Credit remains outstanding
and on the date such Letter of Credit expires, is cancelled or is drawn upon.
Such fee shall be nonrefundable.

- In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay to the
Issuing Lender the fees set forth in the NationsBank Fee Letter.

- The Administrative Agent shall, promptly following its receipt thereof,
distribute to each Lender all fees received by the Administrative Agent for each
such Lender's account pursuant to this Section.

3.4 L/C Participations. (a) The Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to grant
and hereby grants to each Lender, and, to induce the Issuing Lender to issue
Letters of Credit hereunder, each Lender irrevocably agrees to accept and
purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from the Issuing Lender, on the terms
and conditions hereinafter stated, for such Lender's own account and risk an
undivided interest equal to such Lender's Specified Percentage in the Issuing
Lender's obligations and rights under each Letter of Credit issued by the
Issuing Lender and the amount of each draft paid by the Issuing Lender
thereunder. Each Lender unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with the Issuing
Lender that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing
Lender for which the Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in
accordance with Section 3.5(a), such Lender shall pay to the Issuing Lender upon
demand at the Issuing Lender's address for notices specified herein an amount
equal to such Lender's Specified Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any
part thereof, which is not so reimbursed.

- If any amount required to be paid by any Lender to the Issuing Lender
pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment
made by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to the Issuing
Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such
Lender shall pay to the Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal to the product
of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Effective

24

31

Rate during the period from and including the date such payment is required to
the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Issuing Lender,
times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse
during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount
required to be paid by any Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not in fact made
available to the Issuing Lender by such Lender within three Business Days after
the date such payment is due, the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover
from such Lender, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from
such due date at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus the Applicable Margin. A
certificate of the Issuing Lender submitted to any Lender with respect to any
amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error.

- Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Lender has made payment under
any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender its pro rata share of such
payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), the Issuing Lender receives any
payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or
otherwise, including proceeds of Collateral applied thereto by the Issuing
Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, the Issuing Lender will,
if such payment is received prior to 1:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, on a
Business Day, distribute to such Lender its pro rata share thereof on the same
Business Day or if received later than 1:00 p.m. on the next succeeding Business
Day; provided, however, that in the event that any such payment received by the
Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by the Issuing Lender, such
Lender shall return to the Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously
distributed by the Issuing Lender to it.

- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each
Lender's obligation to make the Loans referred to in Section 3.5(b) and to
purchase and fund participating interests pursuant to Section 3.4(a) shall be
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance,
including, without limitation, (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense
or other right which such Lender or the Borrower may have against the Issuing
Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the
occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to
satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 6; (iii) any adverse
change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of any Loan Party; (iv) any
breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by any Loan Party or any
Lender; or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or
not similar to any of the foregoing.

3.5 Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower. (a) The Borrower agrees to
reimburse the Issuing Lender (it being understood that such reimbursement shall
be effected by means of a borrowing of Loans unless the Managing Agents shall
determine in their sole discretion that such Loans may not be made for such
purpose as a result of a Default or Event of Default pursuant to Section 9(f)),
upon receipt of notice from the Issuing Lender of the date and amount of a draft
presented under any Letter of Credit and paid by the Issuing Lender, for the
amount of (i) such draft so paid and (ii) any taxes, fees, charges or other
costs or expenses incurred by the Issuing Lender in connection with such
payment. Each such payment shall be made to the Issuing Lender, at its address
for notices specified herein in Dollars and in immediately available funds, on
the date

25

32

on which the Borrower receives such notice, if received prior to 11:00 A.M.,
Dallas, Texas time, on a Business Day and otherwise on the next succeeding
Business Day,

- Interest shall be payable on any and all amounts remaining unpaid by
the Borrower under this Section 3.5, (i) from the date the draft presented under
the affected Letter of Credit is paid to the date on which the Borrower is
required to pay such amounts pursuant to paragraph (a) above at a rate per annum
equal to the ABR plus the Applicable Margin and (ii) thereafter until payment in
full at the rate which would be payable on any Loans which were then overdue.
Except as otherwise specified in Section 3.5(a), each drawing under any Letter
of Credit shall constitute a request by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent
for a borrowing of Loans that are ABR Loans pursuant to Section 2.3 in the
amount of such drawing. The Borrowing Date with respect to such borrowing shall
be the date of payment of such drawing and the proceeds of such Loans shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Lender for the
amounts paid under such Letter of Credit.

3.6 Obligations Absolute. Subject to the penultimate sentence of this
Section 3.6, the Borrower's obligations under this Section 3 shall be absolute
and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any
set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower may have or have
had against the Issuing Lender, any Lender or any beneficiary of a Letter of
Credit. The Borrower also agrees with the Issuing Lender that the Issuing Lender
and the Lenders shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower's Reimbursement
Obligations under Section 3.5(a) shall not be affected by, among other things,
- the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon,
even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or
forged, or (ii) any dispute between or among the Borrower and any beneficiary of
any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be
transferred or (iii) any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any
beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. The Issuing Lender
and the Lenders shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or
delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however
transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or
omissions caused by such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender under or
in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents, if
done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in accordance
with the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State
of Texas, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any liability
of either the Issuing Lender or any Lender to the Borrower.

3.7 Letter of Credit Payments. If any draft shall be presented for payment
under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the
Borrower and the Lenders of the date and amount thereof. Subject to Section 3.6,
the responsibility of the Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any
draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit shall, in addition to any
payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited
to determining that the documents (including each draft) delivered under such
Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment appear on their face to be
in conformity with such Letter of Credit.

26

33

3.8 Application. To the extent that any provision of any Application
related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this
Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall apply.

SECTION 4. GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO
LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT

4.1 Interest Rates and Payment Dates. (a) Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear
interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate
per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such day plus the
Applicable Margin in effect for such day.

- Each ABR Loan shall bear interest for each day that it is outstanding
at a rate per annum equal to the ABR for such day plus the Applicable Margin in
effect for such day.

- (i) After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, all Loans and Reimbursement Obligations shall bear interest at a rate
per annum which is equal to (x) in the case of the Loans, the rate that would
otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 4.1 plus 2% or (y) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations, at a rate
per annum equal to the ABR plus the Applicable Margin plus 2% and (ii) if all or
a portion of any interest payable on any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation or any
commitment fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when due
(whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue
amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to ABR plus the Applicable
Margin plus 2%, in each case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from
the date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as
before judgment).

- Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date,
provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall
be payable from time to time on demand.

4.2 Optional and Mandatory Commitment Reductions and Prepayments. (a) The
Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay the Loans, in whole or in
part, without premium or penalty (it being understood that amounts payable
pursuant to Section 4.11 do not constitute premium or penalty), upon at least
three Business Days' irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent (in the case
of Eurodollar Loans) or at least one Business Day's irrevocable notice to the
Administrative Agent (in the case of ABR Loans), specifying the date and amount
of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar Loans, ABR Loans or a
combination thereof, and, in each case if a combination thereof, the principal
amount allocable to each. Upon the receipt of any such notice the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. If any such notice is given,
the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
specified therein, together with (if a Eurodollar Loan is prepaid other than at
the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto) any amounts payable pursuant
to Section 4.11. Partial prepayments of

27

34

Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

- The Borrower shall have the right, upon not less than three Business
Days' notice to the Administrative Agent (which will promptly notify the Lenders
thereof), to terminate the Total Commitment or, from time to time, to reduce the
amount of the Total Commitment; provided that (i) any such reduction of the
Total Commitment shall first be applied as a reduction in the Unavailable
Commitment until the same is eliminated and then as a reduction in the Total
Available Commitment; and (ii) no such termination or reduction of the Total
Commitment shall be permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any
prepayments of the Loans made on the effective date thereof, the sum of the
Aggregate Outstanding Extensions of Credit of all the Lenders would exceed the
aggregate Total Available Commitment then in effect. Any such reduction shall be
in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof and shall reduce permanently the Total Commitment then in effect.

- On the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December,
commencing March 31, 1999, through the Termination Date, the Total Commitment
shall automatically and permanently be reduced by the percentage (the "Quarterly
Percentage Reduction") of the original Total Commitment, as set forth below.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, on the
Termination Date the Total Commitment shall automatically reduce to zero.

[[TABLE]]
QUARTERLY TOTAL PERCENTAGE
CALENDAR PERCENTAGE REDUCTION FOR THE
 YEAR REDUCTION CALENDAR YEAR
-------- ---------- -----------------
1999.......................................................... 1.875% 7.50%
 2000.......................................................... 3.750% 15.00%
 2001.......................................................... 4.375% 17.50%
 2002.......................................................... 5.000% 20.00%
 2003.......................................................... 5.000% 20.00%
 2004.......................................................... 5.000% 20.00%
[[/TABLE]]

- If at any time the sum of the Aggregate Outstanding Extensions of
Credit of all the Lenders exceeds the Total Available Commitment then in effect,
the Borrower shall, without notice or demand, immediately repay the Loans in an
aggregate principal amount equal to such excess, together with interest accrued
to the date of such payment or repayment and any amounts payable under Section
4.11. To the extent that, after giving effect to any prepayment of the Loans
required by the preceding sentence, the sum of the Aggregate Outstanding
Extensions of Credit of

28

35

all the Lenders still exceeds the Total Available Commitment then in effect, the
Borrower shall, without notice or demand, immediately cash collateralize the
then outstanding L/C Obligations in an amount equal to such excess upon terms
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

- In the case of any reduction of the Total Commitment the Borrower
shall, if applicable, comply with the requirements of Section 4.2(d). Each
repayment of the Loans under this Section 4.2 shall be accompanied by accrued
interest to the date of such repayment on the amount repaid. Any amounts
deposited in any cash collateral account established pursuant to this Section
4.2 shall be invested in Cash Equivalents having a one-day maturity or such
other Cash Equivalents as shall be acceptable to the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower.

4.3 Commitment Fees. etc. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender, a commitment fee, on the
average daily amount of the unutilized Available Commitment and on the
Unavailable Commitment computed at a rate per annum based on the Leverage Ratio
in effect for the fiscal quarter preceding the payment date, determined as
follows:

[[TABLE]]
LEVERAGE AVAILABLE UNAVAILABLE
 RATIO COMMITMENT COMMITMENT
----------- ---------- ----------
>5.00:1.00........................................................ 0.375% 0.1875%
<5.00:1.00........................................................ 0.250% 0.1875%
[[/TABLE]]

For purposes of calculating the commitment fee due hereunder, the Leverage Ratio shall be determined as at the end of each of the first three quarterly periods of each fiscal year of the Borrower and as at the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower, based on the relevant financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 7. 1 (a) or (b) and the Compliance Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(b); changes in the Leverage Ratio shall become effective on the date which is the earlier of (i) two Business Days after the date the Administrative Agent receives such financial statements and the corresponding Compliance Certificate and (ii) the 60th day after the end of each of the first three quarterly periods of each fiscal year or the 120th day after the end of each fiscal year, as the case may be, and shall remain in effect until the next change to be effected pursuant to this Section 4.3; provided, that (a) until the first such financial statements and Compliance Certificate are delivered after the date hereof, the Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference to the Leverage Ratio set forth in the Closing Certificate delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 6.1(b), and (b) if any financial statements or the Compliance Certificate referred to above are not delivered within the time periods specified above, then, for the period from and including the date on which such financial statements and Compliance Certificate are required to be delivered until the date on which such financial statements and Compliance Certificate are delivered, then the Leverage Ratio as at the end of the fiscal period that would have been covered thereby shall be deemed to be greater than 5.00 to 1.00. 29

36

Such commitment fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business
Day of each March, June, September and December and on the date on which all of
the Commitments shall have terminated.

- The Borrower shall pay (without duplication of any fee payable under
Section 4.3(a)) to the Managing Agents, for their respective accounts, the fees
in the amounts and on the dates agreed to in the Managing Agents Fee Letter.

4.4 Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) Interest based on the Eurodollar
Rate and fees shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual
days elapsed; and interest based on the ABR shall be calculated on the basis of
a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. The
Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change in the interest
rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the ABR or the Eurocurrency Reserve
Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on
which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and the
amount of each such change in interest rate.

- Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on
the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The
Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower; deliver to the
Borrower a statement showing in reasonable detail the calculations used by the
Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 4.1
(a).

4.5 Conversion and Continuation Options. (a) The Borrower may elect from
time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans to ABR Loans by giving the
Administrative Agent an irrevocable notice substantially in the form of Exhibit
I-2 (a "Notice of Conversion/Continuation"), at least one Business Day prior to
such election, provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar Loans may only be
made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. The Borrower
may elect from time to time to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans or to
continue Eurodollar Loans as Eurodollar Loans by giving the Administrative Agent
a Notice of Conversion/Continuation at least three Business Days prior to such
election. Any such Notice of Conversion/Continuation to Eurodollar Loans shall
specify the length of the initial Interest Period or Interest Periods therefor.
Upon receipt of any such Notice of Conversion/Continuation the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof. All or any part of outstanding
Eurodollar Loans and ABR Loans may be converted as provided herein, provided
that (i) no Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar Loan when any Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) no Loan may be converted into a
Eurodollar Loan if the Interest Period selected therefor would expire after the
Termination Date.

30

37

- Any Eurodollar Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration of
the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the Borrower giving
irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, of the length of the next
Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans, determined in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in Section
1.1, provided that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such (i) when any
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or (ii) after the date that is
one month prior to the Termination Date, and provided, further, that if the
Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this
paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding
proviso such Loans shall be automatically converted to ABR Loans on the last day
of such then expiring Interest Period. Upon receipt of any such notice of
continuation pursuant to this Section 4.5(b), the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender thereof.

4.6 Minimum Amounts of Tranches. All borrowings, conversions, continuations
and payments of Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder
shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after
giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans
comprising each Tranche shall be equal to $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $
1,000,000 in excess thereof. In no event shall there be more than six Tranches
outstanding at any time.

4.7 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. If prior to the first day of any
Interest Period:

- the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by
reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such
Interest Period; or

- the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Majority Lenders that the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined
for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or
maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,

the Administrative Agent shall give facsimile notice thereof to the Borrower and
the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given (x) any
Eurodollar Loans requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period
shall be made as ABR Loans, (y) any Loans that were to have been converted on
the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as
ABR Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be converted, on the
first day of such Interest Period, to ABR Loans. Until such notice has been
withdrawn by the Administrative Agent or the Majority Lenders, as the case may
be, no further Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued as such, nor shall
the Borrower have the right to convert Loans to Eurodollar Loans.

31

38

4.8 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Each borrowing of Loans hereunder
shall be made, each payment by the Borrower on account of any commitment fee
hereunder shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent, and any reduction of
the Total Commitment shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent, pro rata
according to the respective Specified Percentages of the Lenders. Each payment
(including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and
interest on, or commitment fees related to, the Loans or Reimbursement
Obligations shall be allocated by the Administrative Agent pro rata according to
the respective Specified Percentages of such Loans and Reimbursement Obligations
then held by the Lenders. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the
Borrower hereunder and under any Notes, whether on account of principal,
interest, fees, Reimbursement Obligations or otherwise, shall be made without
set-off or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 1:00 P.M., Dallas, Texas
time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
the Lenders, at the Administrative Agent's office specified in Section 12.2, in
Dollars and in immediately available funds. Payments received by the
Administrative Agent after such time shall be deemed to have been received on
the next Business Day. If any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day
other than a Business Day, the maturity of such payment shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day, (and, with respect to payments of principal,
interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such
extension) unless, with respect to payments of Eurodollar Loans only, the result
of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month,
in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business
Day.

- Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by
any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that
would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative
Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such
amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the
required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate
equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate for the period until
such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent.
A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect
to any amounts owing under this Section 4.8 shall be conclusive in the absence
of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made
available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days
of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of
the failure of such Lender to make such amount available to the Administrative
Agent and the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover, on demand
from the Borrower, such amount with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal
to the ABR plus the Applicable Margin in effect on the Borrowing Date.

4.9 Requirements of Law. (a) If the adoption of or any change in any
Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance
by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to
the date hereof:

32

39

- shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with
respect to this Agreement, any Note or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or
change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof
(except for Non-Excluded Taxes covered by Section 4.10, net income taxes
and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes));

- shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by,
deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or
other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any
office of such Lender which is not otherwise included in the determination
of the Eurodollar Rate; or

- shall impose on such Lender any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender,
by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into,
continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or to reduce any amount receivable
hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall
promptly pay such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.

- If any Lender shall have determined in good faith that the adoption of
or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing
the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender
or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's
policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by
such Lender to be material, then from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly
pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender for such reduction.

- If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant
to this Section 4.9, it shall promptly deliver a certificate to the Borrower
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail an
explanation of the basis for requesting such compensation. Such certificate as
to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 4.9 submitted by such
Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The Borrower shall pay each Lender
the amount shown as due on any such certificate delivered by it within 15 days
after the Borrower's receipt thereof. The agreements in this Section 4.9 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

4.10 Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement and
any Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding
for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes,
levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or
hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental
Authority, excluding (i) net income taxes; (ii) franchise and doing business
taxes imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a present
or former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the
jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such
connection arising solely from the Administrative Agent or such Lender having
executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or
enforced, this Agreement or any Note); (iii) any Taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings that are in effect and that would apply to a
payment to such Lender as of the Effective Date; and (iv) if any Person acquires
any interest in this Agreement or any Note pursuant to the provisions hereof,
including without limitation a participation (whether or not by operation of
law), or a foreign Lender changes the office in which the Loan is made,
accounted for or booked (any such Person or such foreign Lender in that event
being referred to as a "Tax Transferee"), any Taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings to the extent that they are in effect and
would apply to a payment to such Tax Transferee as of the date of the
acquisition of such interest or change in office, as the case may be. If any
such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees deductions or
withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") are required to be withheld from any amounts
payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any Note,
the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be
increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such
Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes) interest or any such other
amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this
Agreement, provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to
increase any such amounts payable to any Non-U.S. Lender if such Lender fails to
comply with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this Section. Whenever any
Non-Excluded Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible
thereafter the Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own
account or for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy
of an original official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment
thereof. If, when the Borrower is required by this Section 4.10(a) to pay any
Non-Excluded Taxes, the Borrower fails to pay such NonExcluded Taxes when due to
the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent
the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall
indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes,
interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender as a result of any such failure.

- Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a citizen or resident of the
United States of America, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States of America, or any estate or
trust that is subject to federal income taxation regardless of the source of its
income (a "Non-U.S. Lender" ) shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender from which
the related participation shall have been purchased) two copies of either U.S.
Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or Form 4224, or, in the case of a Non-U.S.
Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal

34

41

withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to
payments of "portfolio interest", a Form W-8, or any subsequent versions thereof
or successors thereto (and, if such Non-U.S. Lender delivers a Form W-8, an
annual certificate representing that such Non-U.S. Lender (i) is not a "bank"
for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code (and is not subject to regulatory or
other legal requirements as a bank in any jurisdiction, and has not been treated
as a bank in any filing with or submission made to any Governmental Authority or
rating agency), (ii) is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of
Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and (iii) is not a controlled
foreign corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section
864(d)(4) of the Code)), properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S.
Lender claiming complete exemption from, U.S. federal withholding tax on all
payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
along with such other additional forms as the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
(or, in the case of a Participant, the Lender from which the related
participation shall have been purchased) may reasonably request to establish the
availability of such exemption. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S.
Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the
case of any Participant, on or before the date such Participant purchases the
related participation). In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such
forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously
delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify
the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to
provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form
of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose).
Notwithstanding any other provision of Section 4.10, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not
be required to deliver any form pursuant to this Section 4.10(b) that such
Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver, it being understood and agreed
that, in the event that a Non-U.S. Lender fails to deliver any forms otherwise
required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 4.10(b), or notifies the
Borrower that any previously delivered certificate is no longer in force, the
Borrower shall withhold such amounts as the Borrower shall reasonably determine
are required by law and shall not be required to make any additional payment
with respect thereto to the Non-U.S. Lender, unless such failure to deliver or
notify is a result of change in law subsequent to the date hereof.

- If a Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent shall become
aware that it is entitled to receive a refund in respect of Non-Excluded Taxes
paid by the Borrower, or as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower,
which refund in the good faith judgment of such Lender (or Transferee) is
allocable to such payment made pursuant to this Section 4.10, it shall promptly
notify the Borrower of the availability of such refund and shall, within 30 days
after receipt of a request by the Borrower, apply for such refund. If any Lender
(or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent receives a refund in respect of any
Non-Excluded Taxes paid by the Borrower, or as to which it has been indemnified
by the Borrower, which refund in the good faith judgment of such Lender (or
Transferee) is allocable to such payment made pursuant to this Section 4.10, it
shall promptly notify the Borrower of such refund and shall, within 15 days
after receipt, repay such refund to the Borrower. The agreements in this Section
4.10 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the
Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

35

42 4.11 Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to, but not including, the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have accrued to such Bank on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank Eurodollar market. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 4.12 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that if it makes any demand for payment under Section 4.9 or 4.10(a), it will use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions and so long as such efforts would not be disadvantageous to it, as determined in its sole discretion) to designate a different lending office if the making of such a designation would reduce or obviate the need for the Borrower to make payments under Section 4.9 or 4.10(a) or would eliminate or reduce the effect of any adoption or change described in Section 4.9. SECTION 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Loans and to issue Letters of Credit, the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries hereby represent and warrant to the Administrative Agent and each Lender that: 5.1 Financial Condition. (a) The consolidated balance sheet of the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at May 31, 1995 and the related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the fiscal year ended on such date, reported on by Arthur Andersen L.L.P., copies of which have heretofore been furnished to each Lender, present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial condition of the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the fiscal year then ended. All such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by such accountants and as disclosed therein). Neither the Parent, the Borrower nor any of their consolidated Subsidiaries had, as of May 31, 1995, any material Guarantee Obligation, 36

43

contingent liability or liability for taxes, or any long-term lease or unusual
forward or long-term commitment, including, without limitation, any interest
rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction, which is not reflected in
the foregoing statements or in the schedules or notes thereto. Except as set
forth on Schedule 5.1, during the period from May 31, 1995 to and including the
date hereof there has been no sale, transfer or other disposition by the Parent
or any of its consolidated Subsidiaries of any material part of its business,
assets or property and no purchase or other acquisition of any business, assets
or property (including any Capital Stock of any other Person) material in
relation to the consolidated financial condition of the Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries at May 31, 1995, other than the Asset Transfer.

- The financial statements of the Borrower and the Restricted
Subsidiaries and other information most recently delivered under Sections 7.1(a)
and (b) were prepared in accordance with GAAP and present fairly the
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the
Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries as of, and for the portion of the
fiscal year ending on the date or dates thereof (subject in the case of interim
statements only to normal year-end audit adjustments). There were no material
liabilities, direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, of the Borrower or the
Restricted Subsidiaries as of the date or dates of such financial statements
which are not reflected therein or in the notes thereto. Except for transactions
directly related to, or specifically contemplated by, the Loan Documents, there
have been no changes in the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower or
the Restricted Subsidiaries from that shown in such financial statements after
such date which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
nor has the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary incurred any liability
(including, without limitation, any liability under any Environmental Law),
direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, after such date which could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.2 No Change. Since the Effective Date there has been no development or
event which has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

5.3 Existence; Compliance with Law. The Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has
the corporate or partnership power and authority, and the legal right, to own
and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as lessee and to
conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified
and, where applicable, in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction
where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law except to the extent that
the failure to comply therewith could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

5.4 Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations. Each Loan Party and the
Parent have the power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and
perform each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of
the Borrower, to consummate the Asset Transfer and borrow hereunder, and has
taken all necessary corporate or partnership action to

37

44 authorize the consummation of the Asset Transfer and the execution, delivery and performance of each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to authorize the borrowings on the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Prior to March 31, 1996, except as set forth on Schedule 5.4, no consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person (including any partner or shareholder of any Loan Party or any Affiliate of any Loan Party) is required to be obtained or made by any Loan Party, the Parent or any Subsidiary of any Loan Party in connection with the Asset Transfer other than (a) the filings referred to in Section 6.1(k), and (b) such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect; provided, that with respect to third party approvals necessary for the Asset Transfer, Schedule 5.4 lists only the material third party approvals required. On and after March 31, 1996, no consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person (including any partner or shareholder of any Loan Party or any Affiliate of any Loan Party) is required to be obtained or made by any Loan Party, the Parent or any Subsidiary of any Loan Party in connection with the Asset Transfer other than (a) the filings referred to in Section 6.1(k), and (b) such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect. No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person (including any partner or shareholder of the Parent, any Loan Party or any Affiliate of the Parent or any Loan Party) is required to be obtained or made by the Parent or any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of any Loan Party in connection with the borrowings hereunder or with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents other than (a) the filings referred to in Section 6.1(k), and (b) such as have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect. Each Loan Document to which the Parent and each Loan Party is a party has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Parent and each such Loan Party. Each Loan Document constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Parent, to the extent the Parent is a party thereto, and each Loan Party party thereto enforceable against the Parent and each such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 5.5 No Legal Bar. The Asset Transfer, the execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents, the borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not (a) violate, result in a default under or conflict with any Requirement of Law or any material Contractual Obligation, in any material respect, of the Parent, the Borrower or of any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or (b) violate any provision of the charter or bylaws of the Parent, the Borrower or the Restricted Subsidiaries and will not result in a default under, or result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any such Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation (other than pursuant to the Security Documents). 5.6 No Material Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.6, no litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened by or against the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries or against any of its or their respective properties or revenues (a) with respect to any of 38

45

the Loan Documents, the Asset Transfer or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or (b) which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. No attachment, prejudgment or judgment Lien encumbers any asset
of the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries other than in respect of
- claims as to which payment in full above any applicable customary deductible
is covered by insurance or a bond or (ii) other claims aggregating not more than
$10,000,000. No litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Borrower, threatened by or against the Parent with respect to the Asset Transfer
or any of the Loan Documents to which the Parent is a party.

5.7 No Default. Neither the Parent, the Borrower nor any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries is in default under or with respect to any of its Contractual
Obligations in any respect which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

5.8 Ownership of Property; Intellectual Property. (a) Each of the Borrower
and the Restricted Subsidiaries has good record and indefeasible title in fee
simple to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its real property, and good
title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its other material property, and
none of such property is subject to any Lien except as permitted by Section 8.3.
Schedule 5.8(a) (as supplemented from time to time) accurately describes the
location of all real property owned or leased by the Borrower and all tangible
personal property associated with Cable Systems owned by the Borrower.

- The Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries have the right to use all
trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, technology, know-how or processes
("Intellectual Property") that are necessary for the conduct of the business of
the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries.

5.9 No Burdensome Restrictions. No Requirement of Law or Contractual
Obligation of the Parent, the Borrower or any of their respective Subsidiaries
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

5.10 Taxes. (a)(i) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has filed or
caused to be filed all tax returns which, to the knowledge of the Borrower, are
required to be filed and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable by it on
said returns and all other material taxes, fees or other charges (collectively,
the "Specified Taxes") imposed on it or any of its property by any Governmental
Authority due and payable by it and (ii) to the knowledge of the Borrower, no
material claim is being asserted with respect to any Specified Tax, other than,
in each case with respect to this clause (a), Specified Taxes the amount or
validity of which are currently being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings diligently pursued and with respect to which reserves in conformity
with GAAP have been provided on the books of the Borrower or the relevant
Subsidiary, as the case may be, and (b) no tax Lien has been filed with respect
to any Specified Tax.

39

46 5.11 Federal Regulations. No part of the proceeds of any Loans will be used for "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulation G or Regulation U of the Board as now and from time to time hereafter in effect. If requested by any Lender or the Administrative Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements of FR Form G-3 or FR Form U-I referred to in said Regulation G or Regulation U, as the case may be. 5.12 ERISA. Except as, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect: (a) neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code; (b) no termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during such five-year period; (c) the present value of all accrued benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits; (d) neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan, and neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become subject to any liability under ERISA if the Borrower or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this representation is made or deemed made; and (e) no such Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization or Insolvent. 5.13 Investment Company Act; Other Regulations. No Loan Party is an "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. No Loan Party is subject to regulation under any Federal or State statute or regulation (other than Regulation X of the Board) which limits its ability to incur Indebtedness under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents. 5.14 Subsidiaries. Except for changes otherwise permitted by this Agreement, Schedule 5.14 sets forth a true and complete list of each of the Borrower's Subsidiaries and accurately designates as of the date hereof whether each such Subsidiary is a Restricted Subsidiary or an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of this Agreement. The outstanding shares of Capital Stock of each Restricted Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable, and, except as otherwise indicated on Schedule 5.14 or otherwise permitted by this Agreement, all of the outstanding shares of each class of the Capital Stock of each Restricted Subsidiary are owned, directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record, by the Borrower, free and clear of all Liens. 40

47

5.15 Insurance. Each Loan Party maintains with financially sound,
responsible, and reputable insurance companies or associations (or, as to
workers' compensation or similar insurance, with an insurance fund or by
self-insurance authorized by the jurisdictions in which it operates) insurance
covering its properties and businesses against such casualties and contingencies
and of such types and in such amounts (and with co-insurance and deductibles) as
is customary in the case of same or similar businesses.

5.16 Certain Cable Television Matters. Except as could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect:

- the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries possess all
Authorizations necessary to own, operate and construct the Cable Systems or
otherwise for the operations of their businesses and are not in violation

Administrative Agent or any Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document did not, as of the date such Information was made
available, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
materially misleading in light of the circumstances under which such statements
were made.

- All pro forma financial information and projections made available to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document have been prepared and furnished to the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in good faith and were based on estimates
and assumptions that were believed by the management of the Borrower to be
reasonable in light of the then current and foreseeable business conditions of
the Borrower and the Subsidiaries. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders
recognize that such pro forma financial information and projections and the
estimates and assumptions on which they are based may or may not prove to be
correct.

5.19 Security Documents. The Security Documents are effective to create in
favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, a legal,
valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral described therein and
proceeds thereof and, after satisfaction of the conditions specified in Section
6.1(j) and the making of the filings referred to in Section 6.1(k), the Security
Documents shall constitute a fully perfected first priority Lien on, and
security interest in, all right, title and interest of, the Borrower and the
Restricted Subsidiaries in such Collateral and the proceeds thereof (subject to

material respects with all material terms and conditions of all Franchise
Agreements relating to the Cable Systems owned by it, and on and after the date
of acquisition of any Cable System will be in compliance in all material
respects with all material terms and conditions of all Franchise Agreements
relating to such Cable Systems so acquired and no event has occurred or exists
which permits, or, after the giving of notice, or the lapse of time or both

Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Borrower which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates. 10.7 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Specified Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which the Loans shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with their Specified Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 67

74

10.8 The Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The
Administrative Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower as though the
Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents. With respect to the Loans made by it, the Administrative
Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the
Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.

10.9 Successor Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent may
resign as the Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders and the
appointment of a successor Administrative Agent as hereinafter provided. If the
Administrative Agent shall resign as the Administrative Agent under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then, unless an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing (in which case, the Majority Lenders shall
appoint a successor), the Borrower shall appoint from among the Lenders a
successor Administrative Agent for the Lenders, which successor Administrative
Agent shall be approved by the Majority Lenders (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld). If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so
appointed by the Borrower (or in the case of an Event of Default, by the
Majority Lenders) and such successor Administrative Agent has not accepted such
appointment within 30 days after such resignation, then the resigning
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent hereunder shall be
either a Lender or, if none of the Lenders is willing to serve as successor
Administrative Agent, a major international bank having combined capital and
surplus of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such
successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of
the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such
successor Administrative Agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and
the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as the
Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or
deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to
this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. After any retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation as the Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section
10 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by
it while it was the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

- In the event that the Administrative Agent shall have breached any of
its material obligations to the Lenders hereunder, the Majority Lenders may
remove the Administrative Agent, effective on the date specified by them, by
written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower. Upon any such
removal, the Borrower, provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing (in which case the Majority Lenders shall make the appointment),
shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which
successor Administrative Agent shall be approved by the Majority Lenders (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). If no successor Administrative
Agent shall have been so appointed by the Borrower (or in the case of an Event
of Default, by the Majority Lenders) and such successor Administrative Agent has
not

68

75 accepted such appointment within 30 days after notification to the Administrative Agent of its removal, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent hereunder shall be either a Lender or, if none of the Lenders is willing to serve as successor Administrative Agent, a major international bank having combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000. Such successor Administrative Agent, provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. The Borrower and the Lenders shall execute such documents as shall be necessary to effect such appointment. After any retiring Administrative Agent's removal hereunder as the Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 10.9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was the Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. If at any time there shall not be a duly appointed and acting Administrative Agent, the Borrower agrees to make each payment due hereunder and under the Notes directly to the Lenders entitled thereto during such time. 10.10 Managing Agents and Co-Agents. No Managing Agent or Co-Agent in their respective capacities as such shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against any Managing Agent or Co-Agent in their respective capacities as such. SECTION 11. NEW RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES The Borrower and each Restricted Subsidiary hereby agree to promptly, after the creation, acquisition and/or designation of a Restricted Subsidiary, notify the Administrative Agent of the existence thereof and to promptly cause each such new Restricted Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent (a) an assumption agreement, in form satisfactory to the Lenders, pursuant to which, inter alia, any such new Restricted Subsidiary shall become a party to this Agreement, shall assume all obligations of a Restricted Subsidiary under this Agreement and shall agree that it is a Restricted Subsidiary for all purposes of this Agreement; and (b) a Pledge Agreement in the form of Exhibit F hereto. SECTION 12. MISCELLANEOUS 12.1 Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or modified except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.1. The Majority Lenders and each relevant Loan Party may, or, with the written consent of the Majority Lenders, the Administrative Agent and each relevant Loan Party may, from time to time, (a) enter into written amendments, supplements or 69

76

modifications hereto and to the other Loan Documents for the purpose of adding
any provisions to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or changing in any
manner the rights of the Lenders or of the Loan Parties hereunder or thereunder
or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as the Majority Lenders or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, may specify in such instrument, any of
the requirements of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any Default or
Event of Default and its consequences; provided, however, that no such waiver
and no such amendment, supplement or modification shall (i) reduce the amount or
extend the scheduled date of maturity of any Loan or of any installment thereof,
or reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder or extend the
scheduled date of any payment thereof or increase the amount or extend the
expiration date of any Commitment of any Lender, or make any change in the
method of application of any payment of the Loans specified in Section 4.2 or
Section 4.8 without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (ii)
waive, extend or reduce any mandatory Commitment reduction pursuant to Section
4.2, (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of the Intercompany Subordinated
Debt Agreement, this Section 12.1 or reduce any percentage specified in the
definition of Majority Lenders, or consent to the assignment or transfer by any
Loan Party of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents, (iv) release the Collateral except for any Collateral
which is (x) permitted to be disposed of pursuant to Section 8.5(a) or (y) the
subject of a transaction permitted under Sections 8.5(c) or (d), which
Collateral may be released by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.5,
- amend, modify or waive any condition precedent to any extension of credit
set forth in Section 6, in each case of (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) above,
without the written consent of all of the Lenders, (vi) amend, modify or waive
any provision of Section 10 without the written consent of the then
Administrative Agent or (vii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 3
without the written consent of the Issuing Lender. Any such waiver and any such
amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Lenders
and shall be binding upon the Loan Parties, the Lenders, the Administrative
Agent and all future holders of the Notes. In the case of any waiver, the Loan
Parties, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be restored to their
former position and rights hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and any
Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not
continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default
or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.

judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and
administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other
documents or the use of the proceeds of the Loans (all the foregoing in this
clause (d), collectively, the "indemnified liabilities"), provided, that the
Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to any indemnitee with respect to
indemnified liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such indemnitee. The agreements in this Section shall survive repayment of
the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

12.6 Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments. (a) This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the
Lenders, the Administrative Agent and their respective successors and assigns,
except that neither the Borrower nor the Restricted Subsidiaries may assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of each Lender.

- Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in
accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks or other
entities ("Participants") participating interests in any Loan owing to such
Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a
Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, such Lender's obligations
under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance
thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Loan for all purposes
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents. In no

72

79

event shall any Participant under any such participation have any right to
approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any
consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, except to the extent that
such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on,
the Loans or any fees payable hereunder, or postpone the date of the final
scheduled maturity of the Loans, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation. The Borrower agrees that if amounts outstanding under this
Agreement are due or unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become
due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant
shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed to have the
right of setoff in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under
this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest
were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement, provided that, in
purchasing such participating interest, such Participant shall be deemed to have
agreed to share with the Lenders the proceeds thereof as provided in Section
12.7(a) as fully as if it were a Lender hereunder. The Borrower also agrees that
each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 4.9, 4.10 and
4.11 with respect to its participation in the Commitments and the Loans
outstanding from time to time as if it were a Lender; provided that, in the case
of Section 4.10, such Participant shall have complied with the requirements of
said Section and provided, further, that no Participant shall be entitled to
receive any greater amount pursuant to any such Section than the transferor
Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the
participation transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant had no
such transfer occurred.

- Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and in
accordance with applicable law, at any time and from time to time assign to any
Person (an "Assignee") all or any part of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance,
substantially in the form of Exhibit A, executed by such Assignee and such
assigning Lender and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance
and recording in the Register (with a copy to the Borrower); provided that, (i)
no such assignment (other than to any Lender or any affiliate thereof) shall be
in an aggregate principal amount of less than $5,000,000 and $1,000,000
multiples thereof, (ii) after giving effect to any such assignment, the
assigning Lender (together with any Lender which is an affiliate of such
assigning Lender) shall retain no less than 49% of its original Commitment,
unless otherwise agreed to by the Borrower and (iii) each assignment (other than
to any Lender or any affiliate thereof) shall be subject to the prior written
consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Upon
such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective
date determined pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the Assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such
Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder
with a Commitment as set forth therein, and (y) the assigning Lender thereunder
shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, be released
from its obligations under this Agreement.

- Any Non-U.S. Lender that could become completely exempt from
withholding of any tax, assessment or other charge or levy imposed by or on
behalf of the United States or any taxing authority thereof ("U.S. Taxes") in
respect of payment of any Obligations due to such Non-U.S. Lender under this
Agreement if the Obligations were in registered form for U.S. federal income tax
purposes may request the Borrower (through the Administrative Agent), and the
Borrower agrees thereupon, to exchange any promissory note(s) evidencing such
Obligations for promissory note(s) registered as provided in paragraph (f) below
and substantially in the form of Exhibit N (an "Alternative Note"). Alternative
Notes may not be exchanged for promissory notes that are not Alternative Notes.

- Each Non-U.S. Lender that could become completely exempt from
withholding of U.S. Taxes in respect of payment of any Obligations due to such
Non-U.S. Lender if the Obligations were in registered form for U.S. Federal
income tax purposes and that holds Alternative Note(s) (an "Alternative
Noteholder") (or, if such Alternative Noteholder is not the beneficial owner
thereof, such beneficial owner) shall deliver to the Borrower prior to or at the
time such Non-U.S. Lender becomes an Alternative Noteholder a Form W-8
(Certificate of Foreign Status of the U.S. Department of Treasury) (or any
successor or related form adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities), together with
an annual certificate stating that (i) such Alternative Noteholder or beneficial
owner, as the case may be, is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)
of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section
871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and is not a controlled foreign
corporation related to the Company (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of
the Code) and (ii) such Alternative Noteholder or beneficial owner, as the case
may be, shall promptly notify the Borrower if at any time such Alternative
Noteholder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, determines that it is no
longer in a position to provide such certification to the Borrower (or any other
form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purposes).

- An Alternative Note and the Obligation(s) evidenced thereby may be
assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part only by registration of
such assignment or transfer of such Alternative Note and the Obligation(s)
evidenced thereby on the Register (and each Alternative Note shall expressly so
provide). Any assignment or transfer of all or part of such Obligation(s) and
the Alternative Note(s) evidencing the same shall be registered on the Register
only upon surrender for registration of assignment or transfer of the
Alternative Note(s) evidencing such Obligation(s), duly endorsed by (or
accompanied by a written instrument of assignment or transfer duly executed by)
the Alternative Noteholder thereof, and thereupon one or more new Alternative
Note(s) in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the designated
Assignee(s). No assignment of an Alternative Note and the Obligation(s)
evidenced thereby shall be effective unless it has been recorded in the Register
as provided in this Section 12.6(f).

- The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Borrower, shall maintain at
the address of the Administrative Agent referred to in Section 12.2 a copy of
each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register (the "Register")
for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders (including
Alternative Noteholders) and the Commitments of, and principal

74

81

amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the
Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may (and, in the case of any
Loan or other obligation hereunder not evidenced by a Note, shall) treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Loan or other
obligation hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. Any
assignment of any Loan or other obligation hereunder not evidenced by a Note
shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made
in the Register. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower
or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

- Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender and an Assignee together with payment to the Administrative
Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,000, the Administrative Agent
shall (i) promptly accept such Assignment and Acceptance and (ii) on the
effective date determined pursuant thereto record the information contained
therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance and recordation to
the Lenders and the Borrower.

- Subject to Section 12.15, the Borrower authorizes each Lender to
disclose to any Participant or Assignee (each, a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee, subject to the Transferee agreeing to be bound by the
provisions of Section 12.15, any and all financial information in such Lender's
possession concerning the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries which has
been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement or which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the
Borrower in connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of the Borrower and
its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to becoming a party to this Agreement.

- For avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Agreement acknowledge that
the provisions of this Section concerning assignments of Loans and Notes relate
only to absolute assignments and that such provisions do not prohibit
assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation, any
pledge or assignment by a Lender of any Loan or Note to any Federal Reserve Bank
in accordance with applicable law.

12.7 Adjustments, Set-off. (a) If any Lender (a "benefitted Lender") shall
at any time receive any payment of all or part of its Loans, or interest
thereon, or receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or
involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Section 9(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any
such payment to or collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect
of such other Lender's Loans, or interest thereon, such benefitted Lender shall
purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating interest in such
portion of each such other Lender's Loan, or shall provide such other Lenders
with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be
necessary to cause such benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or
benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the Lenders;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits
is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be

75

82

rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest.

- In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law,
each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such
notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by
applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower
hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) to
set-off and appropriate and apply against such amount, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or
claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or
contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or
any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender,
provided that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

12.8 Counterparts; When Effective. This Agreement may be executed by one or
more of the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts
(including by facsimile transmission), and all of said counterparts taken
together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the
copies of this Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent. This Agreement shall become effective
when the Administrative Agent has received counterparts hereof executed by the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender (such date herein referred to
as the "Effective Date").

12.9 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

12.10 Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent
the agreement of the Parent, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof, and there are no promises,
undertakings, representations or warranties by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender relative to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to
herein or in the other Loan Documents.

12.11 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE
PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
