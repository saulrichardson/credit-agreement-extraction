[[A0065]]
THE PARTIES HERETO, INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, hereby agree as follows:

[[A0066]]
SECTION 1

[[A0067]]
AMOUNT AND TERMS OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT

[[A0068]]
1.1. COMMITMENT OF THE BANK.

[[A0069]]
1.1.1. Commitment.

[[A0070]]
The Bank agrees, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and provided that no Event of Default or Default (the definitions of these and other capitalized terms used herein having the meanings provided in Section 10) then exists, to provide Credits to Borrower in the form of Revolving Credit Loans from time to time on and after the date hereof but prior to February 28, 1999 (the "Maturity Date") in respective amounts selected by Borrower from time to time, provided that the aggregate amount thereof at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the Commitment.

[[A0071]]
1.1.2. Maximum Commitment.

[[A0072]]
The amount of the Commitment shall equal the lesser of the Borrowing Base or (a) $75,000,000 from the date hereof until and including March 31, 1996 (the "Reduction Date") or (b) $45,000,000 thereafter.

[[A0073]]
All provisions of this Agreement relating to reduction of the Commitment, including the provisions of Section 1.2, shall apply to the reduction of the Commitment provided for in this Section 1.1.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower reduces the amount of the Commitment to $45,000,000 or less pursuant to Section 1.2 of this Agreement before March 31, 1996, then, for purposes hereof, the "Reduction Date" shall be deemed to refer to the date upon which such reduction actually took place.

[[A0074]]
The maximum amount of all Credits of the Bank to Borrower under this Section 1 at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the total of the Commitment.

[[A0075]]
For the purpose of computing the

[[A0076]]
11

[[A0077]]
unused portion of the Commitment, the Bank shall treat as outstanding Credits under this Agreement the undrawn face amount of outstanding Letters of Credit issued from time to time hereunder at the request of Borrower.

[[A0078]]
Upon repayment of any outstanding Credit, the amount of such Credit will again be available for reborrowing hereunder.

[[A0079]]
1.1.3. Letters of Credit.

[[A0080]]
- Borrower may request a Letter of Credit by completing the
Bank's then standard application for a Letter of Credit (copy of current
standard application is attached as Exhibit 1.1.3) and delivering the
application to the Bank at least two Banking Days before the date on which the
Letter of Credit is to be issued.

[[A0081]]
On the date the Letter of Credit is to be
issued, the Bank shall deliver the Letter of Credit to Borrower, or to the
Person designated by Borrower.

[[A0082]]
No Letter of Credit shall be issued with an
expiration date (i) more than 180 days after the date of issuance, or (ii) after

[[A0083]]
Except as otherwise provided herein, all the terms of the Letter of
Credit and such standard application shall govern the Letter of Credit.

[[A0084]]
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, the face amount of
all Letters of Credit outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $5,000,000.

[[A0085]]
- Borrower shall immediately reimburse the Bank for the
amount paid on all drafts drawn under Letters of Credit issued hereunder.

[[A0086]]
If,
notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Borrower should fail to so immediately
reimburse the Bank, then, in addition to any other remedy which the Bank may
have with respect to such failure, any amount paid by the Bank on any draft
under a Letter of Credit shall be treated as a Variable Rate Loan (bearing
interest at the rate set forth in Section 3.5 hereof with respect to Revolving
Credit Loans which have become due and payable) unless Borrower makes
alternative advance provision for the funding of such reimbursement satisfactory
to the Bank.

[[A0087]]

[[A0090]]
- any such cancellation or reduction shall be irrevocable;

[[A0091]]

Credit Note;

[[A0092]]
- in the event of a reduction of the Commitment to an
amount less than the principal amount of the then outstanding Revolving
Credit Loans and Letters of Credit, Borrower shall pay the Revolving
Credit Note so that the unpaid principal amount

[[A0093]]
2

[[A0094]]
12

[[A0095]]
of the then outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and Letters of Credit does not exceed the Commitment as so reduced; and

[[A0096]]
- Borrower may not cancel, prepay or reduce LIBO Rate Loans
unless Borrower first pays all fees, costs, penalties and premiums
incurred by the Bank because of such cancellation, prepayment or
reduction.

[[A0098]]
All principal payments made pursuant to this Section 1.2 shall be accompanied by the payment of accrued interest on such principal to the date of such payment and such additional consideration as may be required pursuant to Section 1.2.1(d).

Borrowing Date.

[[A0117]]
Requests for LIBO Rate Loans shall be made by 12:00 noon on the

[[A0118]]
- In the case of a request for a LIBO Rate Loan, the Bank

[[A0119]]
Borrower shall, no later

than the Maturity Date); (ii) to make such borrowing as a Variable Rate Loan; or
- to cancel its request for a Revolving Credit Loan.

The Revolving Credit Note shall (a) be dated the date of this Agreement; (b) be stated to mature on the Maturity Date; and (c) bear interest at the applicable interest rate per annum as provided in, and payable as specified in, this Section 1.5. Each Revolving Credit Loan made by the Bank and each payment made on account of principal on the Revolving Credit Note shall be recorded by the Bank on its books and records in the usual and ordinary course of business, such ordinary course books and records to constitute prima facie evidence in the absence of manifest error of the amount of all Revolving Credit Loans and payments; provided, however, that the failure of the Bank to make such recordation shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of Borrower under the Revolving Credit Note.

[[A0125]]
1.5.2. Interest on Variable Rate Loans.

[[A0126]]
Each Variable Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance of such Loan for each day from the day such Loan is made until the Reduction Date at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate plus 50 basis points.

Thereafter, each Variable Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance of such Loan for each day from the day such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to either (a) the Prime Rate plus 50 basis points or (b) the Prime Rate in the case of a Variable Rate Loan made during a period when the most recent quarterly financial statements of Borrower indicate both (i) a LIBO Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.05:1.00 or greater and

[[A0128]]
4

[[A0129]]
14

[[A0130]]
- a LIBO Senior Leverage Ratio of 2.5:1.0 or less.

[[A0131]]
Interest on all Variable
Rate Loans shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
over a year of 360 days.

[[A0132]]
Any change in the interest rate on a Variable Rate Loan
due to a change in the Prime Rate shall take effect, without notice to Borrower,
at the opening of business on the date of such change in the Prime Rate.

[[A0133]]
Interest on the Variable Rate Loans shall be payable quarterly on the last day
of each February, May, August and November commencing on the first such date
following the initial Variable Rate Loan.

[[A0134]]
1.5.3. Interest on LIBO Rate Loans.

[[A0135]]
Each LIBO Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount of such Loan for each day from the day such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the LIBO Rate as in effect on the applicable Trade Date.

[[A0136]]
Borrower shall pay, with respect to each LIBO Rate Loan, such additional amounts as shall be determined pursuant to Section 1.6. Interest on each LIBO Rate Loan shall be payable at the maturity of such Loan.

[[A0137]]
Interest on all LIBO Rate Loans shall be calculated on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days.

[[A0138]]
1.5.4. Additional Interest.

[[A0139]]
For so long as the Bank, or any participating bank, maintains reserves against any category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBO Rate Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which includes loans by a non-United States office of the Bank to United States residents which the Bank, or such participating bank, determines in good faith to be legally required, and as a result the cost to the Bank, or such participating bank, of making or maintaining its LIBO Rate is determined by the Bank, or such participating bank, in good faith to have increased, then the Bank may require Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on any LIBO Rate Loan of the Bank, additional interest on such LIBO Rate Loan at a rate per annum equal to (a)(i) the applicable LIBO Rate divided by (ii) one minus the Euro Reserve Percentage minus (b) the applicable LIBO Rate.

[[A0140]]
1.6. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AND LIMITATIONS RELATING TO LIBO RATE LOANS.

[[A0141]]
1.6.1. Additions.

[[A0142]]
The additional provisions and limitations set forth below shall apply with respect to LIBO Rate Loans:

[[A0143]]
- Deposits Unavailable.

[[A0144]]
If the Bank shall, in good faith,
determine that it is unable to reasonably ascertain the LIBO Rate or either the
Bank or any participating bank is unable to acquire Eurodollar deposits or
Eurocurrency deposits on reasonable terms in an amount sufficient to meet a
request for a LIBO Rate Loan, the Bank shall forthwith give notice thereof to
Borrower, whereupon, until the Bank notifies Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such unavailability no longer exist (which the Bank shall do upon
receiving notice thereof), the obligations of the Bank to make LIBO Rate Loans
shall be suspended.

[[A0145]]
In such event, Borrower may request a Variable Rate Loan of
like amount without regard to the notice requirement of Section 1.4 or may
cancel such request.

[[A0146]]
- Illegality.

[[A0147]]
The obligation of the Bank to make LIBO Rate
Loans hereunder shall be suspended (to the extent necessary to remove such
illegality or impossibility) if any change in any law, treaty, rule or
regulation, or in any interpretation thereof by any

[[A0148]]
5

[[A0149]]
15

[[A0150]]
governmental authority charged with its administration (whether or not having the force of law) including, without limitation, exchange controls, shall, in the sole opinion of the Bank or any participating bank, make it unlawful or impossible for such bank to comply with its obligation to make or maintain any LIBO Rate Loan hereunder for the duration of such illegality or impossibility.

[[A0151]]
The Bank shall promptly notify Borrower of such suspension, whereupon, until the Bank receives notice that such illegality or impossibility ceases to exist and gives notice to Borrower thereof, the obligations of the Bank to make LIBO Rate Loans shall be suspended.

[[A0152]]
Borrower shall, upon receipt of notice from the Bank, either (i) repay in full (or to the extent necessary to remove such illegality or impossibility) the outstanding principal amount of all such LIBO Rate Loans, plus accrued interest thereon or (ii) convert the applicable interest rate payable with respect to such Loan to the interest rate payable on a similar Variable Rate Loan (to the extent such rate is not illegal).

[[A0153]]
- Change in Law.

[[A0154]]
If the Bank has LIBO Rate Loans outstanding
and there shall occur any change in applicable law, treaty, rule, regulation or
in any interpretation thereof by any governmental authority charged with its
administration (whether or not having the force of law) which (i) change
directly affects transactions in Eurodollars or Eurocurrencies, (ii) involves
new or additional taxes, reserves or deposit requirements in regard to the LIBO
Rate Loans or changes in the basis of taxation of payments on such Loans, or
- if the LIBO Rate Loans made hereunder by the Bank were to have been
matched with Eurodollar or Eurocurrency deposits corresponding in amounts to
such LIBO Rate Loans and having maturity dates which are the same as such LIBO
Rate Loans regardless of whether or not such LIBO Rate Loans are in fact so
matched, increases the cost to the Bank or any participating bank of making or
maintaining the LIBO Rate Loans hereunder or reduces the amount of any payments
(whether of principal, interest, or otherwise) receivable by the Bank or any
participating bank as to any LIBO Rate Loans or requires the Bank or any
participating bank to make any payment on or calculated by reference to the
gross amount of any sum received by it as to such LIBO Rate Loans, then:

[[A0155]]
- the Bank shall promptly notify Borrower of the
occurrence of such event;

[[A0156]]
- the Bank shall promptly deliver to Borrower a
certificate stating the change which has occurred, together
with the date thereof and the amount of and the manner of
calculating the increased cost on any outstanding LIBO Rate
Loan; and

[[A0157]]
- upon receipt of such certificate from the Bank,
Borrower shall pay to the Bank within 10 days the amount or
amounts of such additional cost with respect to such
outstanding LIBO Rate Loan as additional compensation
hereunder.

[[A0158]]
- Certificate as to Payment.

[[A0159]]
The certificate of the Bank as
to the additional amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.6.1(c) delivered to
Borrower shall (in the absence of manifest error in the transmission or
calculation) be conclusive evidence of the amount thereof.

[[A0160]]
The protection of
this Section 1.6.1(d) shall be available to the Bank and any participating bank
regardless of any possible contention of invalidity or inapplicability of the
law,

[[A0161]]
6

[[A0162]]
16

[[A0163]]
regulation or condition which has been imposed.

[[A0164]]
However, if Borrower has made a payment of any additional amounts pursuant to Section 1.6.1(c) and any subsequent event occurs which reduces the amount of the increased cost incurred by the Bank or any participating bank, then the Bank shall promptly refund to Borrower an amount equal to such reduction in the amount of increased cost.

[[A0165]]
- Substitution.

[[A0166]]
If Borrower is required to pay to the Bank
any additional amounts pursuant to Section 1.6.1(c), Borrower shall be entitled,
upon giving the Bank not less than five days' written notice, in addition to its
other rights, to prepay all or any portion of an outstanding LIBO Rate Loan with
respect to which such additional amounts of payment are required (any
prohibition against prepayment of such Loans herein contained to the contrary
notwithstanding) by substituting a Variable Rate Loan of equal principal amount
for all or any such portion of the Loan.

[[A0167]]
All such prepayments shall be
accompanied by payment of interest accrued to the date of such prepayments.

[[A0168]]
As a
condition of such prepayments, Borrower shall promptly pay to the Bank upon the
Bank's written request such amount or amounts as in the reasonable good faith
business judgment of the Bank will compensate the Bank for any loss, premium or
penalty incurred by it because of such prepayment.

[[A0169]]
- Increased Costs.

[[A0170]]
In addition to the other amounts payable
hereunder, Borrower shall pay to the Bank such additional amounts as shall
compensate the Bank and any participating Persons pursuant to Section 9 hereof
for increased costs which the Bank or such participating Person, reasonably and
in good faith determines to be allocable to LIBO Rate Loans.

[[A0171]]
Additional amounts
payable under this Section 1.6.1(f) shall be paid by Borrower to the Bank on the
maturity of the respective LIBO Rate Loans, subject to receipt by Borrower from
the Bank of a certificate showing the amount and certifying to the correctness
thereof.

[[A0172]]
- Interest Period.

[[A0173]]
With respect to LIBO Rate Loans, if the
interest period selected by Borrower (i) ends on a day which is not a LIBO
Banking Day, the period so selected shall be extended to the next succeeding
LIBO Banking Day unless such LIBO Banking Day falls in another calendar month,
in which case such interest period shall end on the next preceding LIBO Banking
Day; or (ii) begins on the last LIBO Banking Day of a calendar month (or on a
day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at
the end of such interest period), the period so selected shall end on the last
LIBO Banking Day of the calendar month; provided, however, that notwithstanding
- or (ii) above, no period may be selected which ends after the Maturity Date.

[[A0174]]
1.6.2. Limitation.

[[A0175]]
Charges or additional expenses or otherwise to Borrower under Sections 1.2.1(d), 1.5.4 or 1.6.1 shall be subject to the conditions that each is (a) the subject of notice given to Borrower by the Bank within a reasonable time after the Bank determines that the same may exist; (b) except as to the subjects of Section 1.2.1(d), the result of a change in law or regulation or official interpretation thereof occurring after the date of Closing; (c) not reflected in the determination of any other rate or charge hereunder; and (d) (i) directly attributable and unique to the transactions under this Agreement, or (ii) as to all the Bank's or any participating Person's (pursuant to Section 9 hereof) customers similarly or analogously situated, (A) passed through to or assessed against other customers to the extent the Bank or such participating

[[A0176]]
7

[[A0177]]
17

[[A0178]]
Person is contractually empowered to do so and (B) is allocated among all such customers (without reference to part (A) of this clause).

[[A0179]]
1.6.3. Statement.

[[A0180]]
The Bank's written statement to Borrower that items under or covered by this Section 1.6 are properly chargeable to Borrower under this Agreement, the general nature of those charges, and the amount thereof shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

[[A0181]]
Except only to the extent specifically set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, no charges or additions under or covered by this Section 1.6 shall be payable, and no interest shall accrue thereon, prior to the presentation of the statement described in this Section 1.6.3.

[[A0182]]
1.7. PREPAYMENTS AND RIGHT TO REBORROW.

[[A0183]]
Outstanding Variable Rate Loans may be prepaid in whole at any time or in part from time to time in an amount of U.S. $300,000 or any larger amount which is a whole multiple of $100,000 (or such lesser amount as constitutes the entire amount outstanding) without premium or penalty.

[[A0184]]
The LIBO Rate Loans may be prepaid only as provided for in Section 1.2 or Section 1.6.1(e). No prepayment of a Revolving Credit Loan shall affect Borrower's right to reborrow from the Bank under the Revolving Credit Note before the Maturity Date.

[[A0185]]
1.8. BORROWING BASE.

[[A0186]]
Borrower shall, from time to time, prepay Revolving Credit Loans in such amounts as shall be necessary so that, at all times, the sum of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans is less than or equal to the Borrowing Base as reflected on the most recent Borrowing Base Certificate delivered hereunder.

[[A0187]]
Any prepayment required as a result of a reduced Borrowing Base shall be made within five Banking Days after the delivery of the applicable Borrowing Base Certificate and shall be subject to the provisions of Section 1.2.1(d) hereof.

[[A0188]]
Borrower may, with the consent of the Bank, which consent may be withheld for any reason or no reason, in lieu of making such prepayment, deliver, within said five Banking Days, to the Bank, such additional collateral as the Bank may request accompanied by such documents as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by the Bank to protect the interests of the Bank.

[[A0189]]

The Revolving Credit Loans and the Term Loan are herein collectively called the "Loans" and the Revolving Credit Note and the Term Note are herein collectively called the "Notes".

[[A0193]]

[[A0199]]
2.2.2. Unless Borrower has elected, from time to time, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2.3 to cause all or a portion of the Term Note to bear interest at a LIBO Rate, the Term Note shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance thereof calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days on the unpaid principal balance thereof at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to either (a) the Prime Rate plus 50 basis points or (b) during a period when the most recent quarterly financial statements of Borrower indicate both (i) a LIBO Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.05:1.00 or greater and (ii) a LIBO Senior Leverage Ratio of 2.5:1.0 or less, the Prime Rate.

The Bank shall, not later than 11:00 a.m. on the Trade Date, give notice to Borrower of the LIBO Rate applicable for the period requested by Borrower.

[[A0202]]

[[A0203]]
If Borrower elects not to have all or any part of the Term Note bear interest at the LIBO Rate or fails to deliver such notice of election in a timely manner, the Term Note shall continue to bear interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.2.2 and such portion of the Term Loan bearing interest at a LIBO Rate shall, upon expiration of the period selected for such LIBO Rate, bear interest at such rate.

[[A0204]]
Each election to have a portion of the Term Note bear interest at the LIBO Rate shall be recorded and endorsed by the Bank on its books and records; provided, however, that the failure of the Bank to make such recordation shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of Borrower under the Term Note.

[[A0214]]
When such notice of prepayment has been given to the Bank, the applicable principal amount of the Term Note shall become due and payable on the designated prepayment date.

[[A0215]]
All prepayments will be applied to the Term Loan in the inverse order of maturity.

[[A0216]]
No prepayment of any portion of the principal of the Term Note that bears interest at the LIBO Rate shall be permitted during the effective period of such LIBO Rate for any reason or in any amounts, unless Borrower first pays all fees, costs, penalties and premiums incurred by the Bank because of such prepayment.

[[A0234]]
3.4. CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

If, after the date hereof, there occurs any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Bank, or any participating bank, with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the Bank's, or the participating bank's, capital as a direct consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which the Bank, or the participating bank, could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration the Bank's, or participating bank's, policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by the Bank, or the participating bank, to be material, then, from time to time, within 15 days after demand by the Bank, Borrower shall pay to the Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Bank for such reduction.

[[A0236]]
If Borrower is required to pay to the Bank any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.4, Borrower shall be entitled, upon giving the Bank not less than five days' written notice, in addition to its other rights, to prepay all or any portion of an outstanding Loan with respect to which such additional amounts are due, any provision herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding (all such prepayments shall be with interest accrued to the date of such prepayments).

[[A1080]]
The Company shall not create, incur or suffer to exist any mortgage, pledge, security interest, lien, charge or encumbrance upon the Collateral other than the Lien of this Agreement.

[[A1087]]
5.3. Preservation and Protection of Security Interests.

[[A1088]]
The Company shall faithfully preserve and protect the Bank's security interest in the Collateral and shall, at its own cost and expense, cause such security interest to be perfected and continue perfected so long as the Obligations or any portion thereof are outstanding and unpaid, and for such purpose the Company shall from time to time at the request of the Bank file or record, or cause to be filed or recorded, such instruments, documents and notices, including without limitation financing and continuation statements, as the Bank may deem necessary or advisable from time to time in order to preserve, perfect and continue perfected said security interest.

[[A1096]]
All sums so advanced, with interest as aforesaid, shall be secured by this Agreement.

[[A1111]]

[[A1112]]

Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Bank shall have the right, upon notice to the Company (except that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 8(h) or 7(i) of the Loan Agreement, no notice shall be required), to declare the Obligations immediately due and payable and may, without demand of performance or other demand, advertisement or notice of any kind to or upon the Company or any other Person (all and each of which demands, advertisements and/or notices are hereby expressly waived), forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or forthwith sell, assign, give an option or options to purchase, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of and deliver said Collateral, or any part thereof, in one or more parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker's board or any of the Bank's offices or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk, with the right to the Bank upon any such sale or sales, public or private, to purchase the whole or any part of said Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in the Company, which right or equity is (to the extent permitted by applicable law) hereby expressly waived and released.

[[A1116]]
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company waives all claims, damages and demands against the Bank arising out of the retention or sale of the Collateral.

[[A1117]]
In addition to the rights and remedies granted to it in this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to any of the Obligations, the Bank shall have all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC.

[[A1118]]
7.1.2. The Company recognizes that, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state securities laws, the Bank may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any part of the Collateral, to limit purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire the Collateral for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof.

[[A1119]]
The Company acknowledges that any such private sale may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the Bank than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions, and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that the Bank shall have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay the sale of any Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the respective issuer thereof to register it for public sale.

7.1.5. The Bank shall not incur any liability as a result of the sale of any Collateral, or any part thereof, at any private sale conducted in a commercially reasonable manner, in compliance with any applicable law.

[[A1125]]
The Company hereby waives any claims against the Bank arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any of the Collateral may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Obligations, even if the Bank accepts the first offer received and does not offer any Collateral to more than one offeree, provided that the Bank has acted in a commercially reasonable manner in conducting such private sale.

[[A1126]]
7.1.6. Upon any sale of all or any part of any Collateral made either under the power of sale given hereunder or under judgment or decree in any judicial proceedings for foreclosure or otherwise for the enforcement of this Agreement, the Bank is hereby irrevocably appointed the true and lawful attorney of the Company, in its name and stead, to make all necessary deeds, bills of sale and instruments of assignment, and transfer or conveyance of the property thus sold.

[[A1127]]
For that purpose, the Bank may execute all such documents and instruments.

[[A1128]]
This power of attorney shall be deemed coupled with an interest, and the Company hereby ratifies and confirms all that its said attorney, or its substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do by virtue of this Agreement.

[[A1129]]
If so requested by the Bank or by any purchaser of the Collateral or a portion thereof, the Company shall further ratify and confirm any such sale or transfer by executing and delivering to the Bank or to such purchaser or purchasers at the Company's expense all reasonable and proper deeds, bills of sale, instruments of assignment, conveyance or transfer and releases as may be designated in any such request.

[[A1130]]
7.1.7. When authorized in accordance with this Section 7.1, the Bank may proceed to realize upon the security interest in the Collateral against any one or more of the types of Collateral, at any one time or from time to time, as the Bank shall determine in its sole discretion, subject to the provisions of this Section 7.1. The Bank shall not be required to realize upon any one type of Collateral before proceeding to realize upon the security interest granted in any other type of Collateral.

[[A1131]]
The proceeds of any sale of, or other realization upon, or other receipt from, all or any Collateral shall be applied by the Bank in the manner set forth in Section 6 hereof.

[[A1132]]
7.2. Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission Not a Waiver.

[[A1133]]
To the extent permitted by law and not otherwise provided to the contrary under this Agreement, no remedy given hereunder to the Bank shall be exclusive of any other remedy, and every such remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter given by statute, law, equity or otherwise to the extent not contrary to or inconsistent with the terms of this

FORM OF BORROWER'S COUNSEL'S OPINION

[[A1579]]
1. The Company and each of its Wholly Owned Subsidiaries are corporations duly organized, and each other Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, and the Company and each Subsidiary is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdictions in which incorporated.

[[A1580]]
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have all requisite power and authority, corporate or otherwise, to own or lease their property and carry on their businesses as and in the places where such properties are now located, leased or operated or such businesses are now conducted and the Company has such power and authority to enter into and perform all of its obligations under the Agreement, the Notes, the Security Agreement, and the Pledge Agreement.

[[A1581]]
Each Wholly Owned Subsidiary has all requisite power and authority, corporate or otherwise, to enter into and perform all of its obligations under its Subsidiary Guaranty and Subsidiary Security Agreement.

[[A1582]]
2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Agreement, the Notes, the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action.

[[A1583]]
The Agreement, the Notes, the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by the Company.

[[A1584]]
The Agreement, the Notes, the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, and are enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject as to enforceability to bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity.

[[A1585]]
3. The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Wholly Owned Subsidiaries of its Subsidiary Guaranty and Subsidiary Security Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action.

[[A1586]]
Each of the Subsidiary Guaranties and Subsidiary Security Agreements has been duly executed and delivered by the applicable Wholly Owned Subsidiary.

[[A1587]]
Each of the Subsidiary Guaranties and Subsidiary Security Agreements constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the applicable Wholly Owned Subsidiary, and is enforceable against such Wholly Owned Subsidiary in accordance with its terms, subject as to enforceability to bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity.

[[A1588]]
4.

[[A1589]]
Each of the Notes issued and delivered to the Bank pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement (assuming its due execution and delivery) is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Company in accordance with its terms, subject as to enforceability to bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity.

[[A1590]]
5. To the best of our knowledge, after due inquiry, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of or in default under any provision of: its Certificate of

[[A1591]]
-1-

[[A1592]]
113

[[A1593]]
Incorporation or Bylaws (each as amended to date); any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award presently in effect and having applicability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or any loan, indenture, credit agreement, lease or other instrument which violation or default could materially adversely affect the business, Consolidated financial position or Consolidated results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

[[A1594]]
6.

[[A1595]]
To the best of our knowledge, after due inquiry, the execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement, the Notes, the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement by the Company and of the Subsidiary Guaranties and Subsidiary Security Agreements by each of the Wholly Owned Subsidiaries does not result in a violation of any terms or conditions of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any Wholly Owned Subsidiary, or breach any term or provision of, or constitute a default under, any agreement, note or other agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, which violation, breach or default could materially adversely affect the business, Consolidated financial position or Consolidated results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

[[A1596]]
7.

[[A1597]]
To the best of our knowledge, after due inquiry, there is no action, proceeding or investigation pending or threatened which questions the validity of the Agreement, the Notes or any of the Loan Documents or any action taken or to be taken pursuant thereto, or which might result, either in any case or in the aggregate, in any material and adverse change in the business, operations, affairs or condition of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, their properties and assets or in any material liability on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

[[A1598]]
8. All amounts due or to become due to the Bank under the Agreement are "Senior Indebtedness" as that term is defined in the Indenture.

[[A1599]]
The Debentures are subordinated and subject in right to the prior payment in full of all amounts due or to become due to the Bank under the Agreement to the extent and in the manner set forth in the subsections of Article Fourteen of the Indenture.

[[A1600]]
9. Each Note is, or, upon issuance, will be, entitled to the benefits of, and is secured by valid Liens created by, the Pledge Agreement, the Security Agreement, the Subsidiary Guaranties and the Subsidiary Security Agreements.

[[A1601]]
10.

[[A1602]]
The provisions of the Pledge Agreement, the Security Agreement and the Subsidiary Security Agreements are effective to create in favor of the Bank legal, valid and enforceable security interests as between the parties to those agreements, but specifically excluding any opinion as to the perfection of those security interests except as provided in paragraph 11 below, in all right, title, and interest of the Company and the Wholly Owned Subsidiaries in the Collateral, as defined therein, and further subject as to enforceability to bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity.

[[A1606]]
Assuming (i) the accuracy and completeness of the list of Store Locations set forth on attached Exhibit B, and (ii) that, other than [**Centerline, Inc. as to the State of Delaware and Drug Emporium, Inc. as to the States of South Carolina, Indiana and New Hampshire**], each debtor has a place of business in more than one county of each state listed opposite its respective name on attached Exhibit C, and based solely upon our review of Ohio law and the CCH Secured Transaction Guide as to the other jurisdictions, the filing of financing statements in substantially the form of Exhibit A, with appropriate names of the debtor inserted therein and appropriate exhibits appended thereto (the "Financing Statements") with the Secretary of State and County Recorder (or other comparable official) of the states and counties listed on attached Exhibit C will be sufficient to perfect the Bank's security interest described in the Security Agreement and the Subsidiary Security Agreements in the Collateral as defined therein, and the delivery to the Bank of the Collateral, as defined in the Pledge Agreement, is sufficient to perfect the Bank's security interest described in the Pledge Agreement, except as follows:

[[A1607]]
- in the case of "instruments" [as such term is defined in
Uniform Commercial Code Section 9-105 (1)(i) (Ohio Revised
Code Section 1309.01(A)(9)] not constituting part of "chattel
paper" [as such term is defined in Uniform Commercial Code
Section 9-105(1)(b) (Ohio Revised Code Section 1309.01(A)(2)],
the security interest of the Bank therein cannot be perfected
through the filing of the Financing Statements but will be
perfected if possession thereof is obtained by the Bank;

[[A1608]]
- insofar as the Bank's security interest relates to
after-acquired Collateral, such security interest will be
perfected only when the Company or a Subsidiary acquires
rights in such Collateral;

[[A1609]]
- the effectiveness of the Financing Statements terminates five
years after the date of filing, unless a continuation
statement is filed prior to such termination in accordance
with Uniform Commercial Code Section 9-403(2)-(3) [Ohio
Revised Code Section 1309.40(B)-(C)];

[[A1610]]
- in the case of nonidentifiable cash proceeds, continuation of
perfection of the Bank's security interest therein is limited
to the degree set forth in Uniform Commercial Code Section
9-306 (Ohio Revised Code Section 1309.25);

[[A1611]]
- if the Company or a Subsidiary so changes its name, identity,
or corporate structure that any Financing Statement becomes
seriously misleading, the filing of such Financing Statement
will, pursuant to Uniform Commercial Code Section 9-402(7)
[Ohio Revised Code Section 1309.39(G)], be ineffective to
perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the
Company or any such Subsidiary more than four months after the
change, unless a new appropriate financing statement is filed
before the expiration of that period;

[[A1612]]
- in the case of either (1) the movement of certain tangible
collateral to a state in which a Financing Statement has not
been filed or (2) a change in the location of

[[A1613]]
-3-

[[A1614]]
115

[[A1615]]
the Company or a Subsidiary to a state in which a Financing Statement has not been filed, the Bank's security interest will become unperfected unless a new appropriate financing statement is filed in the new state within four months in accordance with Uniform Commercial Code Section 9-103 (Ohio Revised Code Section 1309.03); and

[[A1616]]
- under certain circumstances described in Uniform Commercial
Code Sections 9-307 and 9-308 (Ohio Revised Code Sections
1309.26 and 1309.27), purchasers of collateral may take the
same free of a perfected security interest.

[[A1617]]
12.

[[A1618]]
To the best of our knowledge, after due inquiry (such inquiry consisting solely of (a) a certificate delivered to us by the Company, and (b) our review of the results of searches conducted by, and made available to us by, the Bank, as set forth on attached Exhibit D), the Bank's perfected security interest in the Collateral described in the Security Agreement and the Subsidiary Security Agreements is prior to any other security interest in such Collateral evidenced by the filing of a financing statement, but only to the extent a security interest in such Collateral created by the Security Agreement and the Subsidiary Security Agreements may be perfected by the filing of financing statement(s), and, assuming that the Bank has no notice of any adverse claim in favor of any third person in the Collateral described in the Pledge Agreement, the Bank's perfected security interest in the Collateral described in the Pledge Agreement is prior to any Liens, except for the following:

[[A1619]]
- the Bank's security interest is subordinate to the Liens
described on Exhibit D attached hereto and made a part hereof;

[[A1620]]
- the Bank's security interest is subordinate to Liens expressly
permitted under the Agreement or the Pledge Agreement, the
Security Agreement or the Subsidiary Security Agreements; and

[[A1621]]
- insofar as the Bank's security interest relates to
after-acquired Collateral, such security interest may be
subordinated in priority to the conflicting security interest
of a purchase-money creditor pursuant to Uniform Commercial
Code Section 9-312(3)-(4) [Ohio Revised Code Section
1309.31(C)-(D)] or to a federal tax lien properly filed more
than 45 days before such security interest arises (or a lesser
period, if the Bank acquires knowledge of such federal tax
lien), pursuant to 26 U.S.C.

Section 6323(c).

PENDING LITIGATION

[[A1626]]
Nortex Drug Distributors, Inc. v. Drug Emporium, Inc., Case No. C2-93-767, filed August 6, 1993, and Texas Drug Distributors, Inc. v. Drug Emporium, Inc., Case No. C2-93-847, filed August 30, 1993, both of which are pending in the United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division.

[[A1627]]
The plaintiffs in the two suits are both franchisees of the Company.

[[A1628]]
The claims set forth in the complaints are substantially the same in both suits and allege that the Company failed to perform as required under the Company's franchise agreements with plaintiffs and under Texas law.

[[A1629]]
Plaintiffs also claim that the Company imposed a mandatory pricing structure on plaintiffs which violated state and federal antitrust laws.

[[A1630]]
The plaintiffs are seeking treble damages and a declaration that the noncompetition clause in the franchise agreements is unenforceable.

[[A1631]]
No specific amount of damages is claimed.

[[A1632]]
The Company is aggressively defending these suits.

As to drafts or acceptance under or purporting to be under the Credit, which are payable in United States Currency, we agree (a) in the case of each sight draft, to reimburse you at your issuing office, on demand, in United States legal tender, the amount paid on such draft, or, if so demanded by you, to pay to you at said office, in advance in such legal tender the amount required to pay such draft; and (b) in the case of each acceptance, to pay to you, at said office, in United States legal tender, the amount thereof, on demand but in any event not later than one business day prior to maturity, or, in case the acceptance is not payable at your said office, then on demand, but in any event in time to reach the place of payment in the usual course of the mails not later than one business day prior to maturity.

[[A1729]]
3. As to drafts or acceptances under or purporting to be under the Credit, which are payable in currency other than United States currency, we agree (a) in the case of each sight draft, to reimburse you, at your issuing office, on demand, the equivalent of the amount paid, in United States legal tender at the rate of exchange then current for cable transfers to the place of payment in the currency in which such draft is drawn, and (b) in the case of each acceptance, to furnish you, at said office, on demand, but in any event in time to reach the place of payment in the usual course of the mails not later than one business day prior to maturity, with first class banker's demand bills of exchange to be approved by you for the amount of the acceptance, payable in the currency of the acceptance and bearing our endorsement, or, if you so request, to pay to you at said office, on demand, the equivalent of the acceptance in United States legal tender at the rate of exchange then current for cable transfers to the place of payment in the currency in which the acceptance is payable.

[[A1730]]
A demand made on one of us shall fix the exchange rate as to all of us, if for any reason whatsoever there shall be at the time of your demand for reimbursement or payment no rate of exchange current for effective cable transfers to the place of payment in the currency in which any such draft is drawn or any such acceptance is payable, we agree to pay you, on demand, in United States legal tender an amount which in your sole judgement shall be sufficient to meet our obligations hereunder, which amount may be applied by you at any time as a payment on account of such obligations, or, at your option, held as security therefor; it being understood, however, that we shall remain liable for any deficiency which may result if such amount in United States legal tender shall prove insufficient to effect full payment or reimbursement to you at the time when a rate of exchange for such cable transfers shall be again current.

5. That, if the foregoing application requests the inclusion in the Credit of any provision for Clean Advances to the beneficiary, you may place in the Credit such a provision in that respect as you may deem appropriate, under which any bank entitled to negotiate drafts under the Credit, acting in its discretion in each instance and upon the request and receipt in writing from the beneficiary, may make any one or more Clean Advances at any time on or prior to the date by which the drafts are to be negotiated under the Credit.

[[A1733]]
The aggregate of such advances shall in no event be more than the amount specified in the Application for Clean Advances, and in no event shall any such advance exceed the amount remaining available under the Credit at the time of the advance.

[[A1734]]
While it is expected by us that each such advance will be repaid to the bank that made the advance by the beneficiary from the proceeds of any drafts drawn under the Credit, should any such advances not be thus repaid, we will on demand pay you the amounts thereof as if such advances were evidenced by drafts drawn under the Credit, together with interest on each such amount for the period that the same shall have been outstanding at such rate as you may find at the time of demand to be payable.

[[A1735]]
It is understood that neither you nor any bank which may make such advances shall be obligated to inquire into the use that may be made thereof by the beneficiary and that you and each such bank shall be without liability for any wrongful use that may be made by the beneficiary of any such funds so advanced.
