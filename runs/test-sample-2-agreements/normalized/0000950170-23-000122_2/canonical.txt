#95537764v15 AMERICAS/2023466857.21

In particular the Loans, Commitments and Total Revolving Outstandings of the Designating Lender will not be treated as reduced by the introduction of the Substitute Affiliate Lender for voting purposes under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents and the Substitute Affiliate Lender will be treated as having no Loans, Commitments or Total Revolving Outstandings for voting purposes. Save as mentioned in the immediately preceding sentence, a Substitute Affiliate Lender will be treated as a Lender for all purposes under the Loan Documents and having a Loan, Commitment or Total Revolving Outstandings equal to the principal amount of all Designated Loans in which it is participating if and for so long as it continues to be a Substitute Affiliate Lender under this Agreement. A Designating Lender may revoke its designation of an Affiliate as a Substitute Affiliate Lender by notice in writing to the Applicable Administrative Agent and provided that such notice may only take effect when there are no Designated Loans outstanding to the Substitute Affiliate Lender. Upon such Substitute Affiliate Lender ceasing to be a Substitute Affiliate Lender the Designating Lender will automatically assume (and be deemed to assume without further action by any party) all rights and obligations previously vested in the Substitute Affiliate Lender. If a Designating Lender designates a Substitute Facility Office or Substitute Affiliate Lender in accordance with this clause: (i) any Substitute Affiliate Lender shall be treated for the purposes of Section 3.05 as having become a Lender on the Restatement Effective Date; and (ii) the provisions of Section 11.06 shall not apply to or in respect of any Substitute Facility Office or Substitute Affiliate Lender.

Non-Extension Notice Date
”) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the Applicable L/C Issuer, the Company shall not be required to make a specific request to the Applicable L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the Applicable L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;
provided

In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Applicable L/C Issuer shall notify the Company of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. If

105

#96465179v1

the Company is notified prior to 11:00 a.m. on the date of any payment by the Applicable L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, then no later than 1:00 p.m. on such Business Day or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by the Applicable L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (or if notified after such time, then no later than 11:00 a.m. on the next succeeding Business Day or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by the Applicable L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency) (each such date, an “ Honor Date ”), the Company shall reimburse the Applicable L/C Issuer through the Revolving Facility Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency. If the Company fails to so reimburse the Applicable L/C Issuer by such time, the Revolving Facility Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) (the “ Unreimbursed Amount ”), and the amount of such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, the Company shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 (other than the delivery of a Loan Notice) and provided that, after giving effect to such Borrowing, the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments. Any notice given by the Applicable L/C Issuer or the Revolving Facility Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

- Each Revolving Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(i)
make funds available (and the
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the Applicable L/C Issuer, in Dollars, at the Administrative Agent’s Office for Dollar denominated payments in an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage multiplied by the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.03(c)(iii)
, each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Revolving Loan in the form of a Base Rate Loan to the Company in such amount. The
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Applicable L/C Issuer in Dollars.

- With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Borrowing of Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in
Section 5.02
cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Company shall be deemed to have incurred from the Applicable L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate applicable to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans;
provided
that if such L/C Borrowing is not reimbursed by the Company when due in accordance with this clause (c), then
Section 2.08(b)(i)
shall apply. In such event, each Revolving Lender’s payment to the
Revolving

106

#95537764v15 AMERICAS/2023466857.21

#96465179v1

Facility Administrative Agent for the account of the Applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Revolving Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03 .

- Until each Revolving Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this
Section 2.03(c)
to reimburse the Applicable L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the Applicable L/C Issuer.

- Each Revolving Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the Applicable L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this
Section 2.03(c)
, shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Applicable L/C Issuer, the Company or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;
provided
,
however
, that each Revolving Lender’s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.03(c)
is subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 5.02
(other than delivery by the Company of a Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Company to reimburse the Applicable L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the Applicable L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

- If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent for the account of the Applicable L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.03(c)
by the time specified in
Section 2.03(c)(ii)
, then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, the Applicable L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting through the
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Applicable L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Applicable L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of the Applicable L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause
(vi)
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(d)

- If any payment received by the
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent for the account of the Applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(i)
is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in
Section 11.05
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Applicable L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent for the account of the Applicable L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Revolving Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

(e)

- any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Company or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally; or

None of the L/C Issuers, the
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Revolving Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Revolving Lenders or the Required Revolving Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment); or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Company hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;
provided

Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of any L/C Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Applicable L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the Applicable L/C Issuer shall not be responsible

109

Eurocurrency Rate
SOFR

123

#95537764v15 AMERICAS/2023466857.21

#96465179v1

to the Obligations.

Applicable
Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by each Borrower hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the
Applicable
Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the
Applicable
Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Applicable
Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, a Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The
Applicable
Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage in respect of the relevant Facility (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments received by the
Applicable
Administrative Agent after (i) 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) the Applicable Time specified by the
Applicable
Administrative Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, may, as determined by the
Applicable
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion, be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day (except for purposes of determining whether an Event of Default has occurred) and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

#96465179v1

Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected on computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

- (i)
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative
Agent
Agents
. Unless the
Applicable
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans
, SONIA Loans
or SOFR Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the
Applicable
Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the
Applicable
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
Section 2.02
(or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by
Section 2.02
) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the
Applicable
Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the
Applicable
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the
Applicable
Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the
Applicable
Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the applicable Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the other Loans included in such Borrowing. If the applicable Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the
Applicable
Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the
Applicable
Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the applicable Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the applicable Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the
Applicable
Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the applicable Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the applicable Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the
Applicable
Administrative Agent.

(ii)
Payments by the Borrowers; Presumptions by the Administrative
Agent
Agents
. Unless the
Applicable
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the time at which any payment is due to the
Applicable
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Applicable L/C Issuer hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment, the
Applicable
Administrative Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders or the Applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders or the Applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the
Applicable
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Applicable L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
Applicable
Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.

125

#95537764v15 AMERICAS/2023466857.21

#96465179v1

A notice of the Applicable Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Company with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

(c)
Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent
. If any Lender makes available to the
Applicable
Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this
Article II
, and such funds are not made available to the applicable Borrower by the
Applicable
Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in
Article V
are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the
Applicable
Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

(d)
Obligations of Lenders Several
. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to
Section 11.04(c)
are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under
Section 11.04(c)
on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under
Section 11.04(c)
.

(e)
Funding Source
. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.

(f)
Insufficient Funds
. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the
Applicable
Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, L/C Borrowings, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i)
first
, toward payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii)
second
, toward payment of principal and L/C Borrowings then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and L/C Borrowings then due to such parties.

2.13 Sharing of Payments by Lenders . If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of (a) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities due and payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lenders at such time or (b) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Parties at such time) of payment on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the Lenders at such time, then the Lender

126

#95537764v15 AMERICAS/2023466857.21

#96465179v1

receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Applicable Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in L/C Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of Obligations in respect of the Facilities then due and payable to the Lenders or owing (but not due and payable) to the Lenders, as the case may be, provided that:

- if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and

- the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (B) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in
Section 2.14
, or (C) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to any Loan Party or any Subsidiary thereof other than in accordance with
Section 11.06(i)
(as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).

Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.13 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the applicable Borrowers may extend the final maturity of Loans and/or Commitments in connection with an Extension that is permitted under Section 2.18 without being obligated to effect such extensions on a pro rata basis among the Lenders (it being understood that no such extension (i) shall constitute a payment or prepayment of any Loans, for purposes of this Section 2.13 or (ii) shall reduce the amount of any scheduled amortization payment due under Section 2.07 , except that the amount of any scheduled amortization payment due to a Lender of Extended Term Loans may be reduced to the extent provided pursuant to the express terms of the respective Extension Amendment) without giving rise to any violation of this Section 2.13 or any other provision of this Agreement. Furthermore, the applicable Borrower may take all actions contemplated by Section 2.18 in connection with any Extension (including modifying pricing, amortization and repayments or prepayments), and in each case such actions shall be permitted, and the differing payments contemplated therein shall be permitted without giving rise to any violation of this Section 2.13 or any other provision of this Agreement.

Administrative Agent, each Applicable L/C Issuer and the Lenders, and shall maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to
Section 2.14(c)
. If at any time the
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any prior or pari passu right or claim of any Person other than the
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting Exposure and other obligations secured thereby, the Company or the relevant Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the

Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency.

(d)
Release
. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Revolving Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with
Section 11.06(b)(vii)
)) or (ii) the
Revolving Facility
Administrative Agent’s good faith determination that there exists excess Cash Collateral;
provided
,
however
, (x) that Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Loan Party shall not be released during the continuance of an Event of Default (and following application as provided in this
Section 2.14
may be otherwise applied in accordance with
Section 9.03
), and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and each Applicable L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations.

provided
,

Section 3.04
or payments required to be made pursuant to

, SONIA Loans
or SOFR Loans, the assignee of such assignment shall not be prohibited from making or maintaining Loans as Eurocurrency Rate Loans
, SONIA Loans
or SOFR Loans;

- such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and

- in the case of any such assignment resulting from a Non-Consenting Lender’s failure to consent to a proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination with respect to any Loan Document, the applicable replacement bank, financial institution or Fund consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination;

provided that the failure by such Lender to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption shall not impair the validity of the removal of such Lender and the mandatory assignment of such Lender’s Commitments and outstanding Loans and participations in L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 11.13 shall nevertheless be effective without the execution by such Lender of an Assignment and Assumption.

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

In case of replacement of any Lender by a new Lender of all or any part of its rights and obligations under any of the Loan Documents, it is agreed that, for the purposes of Article 1278 of the Luxembourg Civil Code (to the extent applicable), any security interests created under the Collateral Documents securing the rights assigned, transferred or novated hereby, will be preserved for the benefit of such new Lender.

Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
