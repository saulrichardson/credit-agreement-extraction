If Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following has occurred: (a) Term SOFR ceases to exist or is no longer available; or (ii) a public announcement is made by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of Term SOFR, or (b) a determination is made by Administrative Agent or Required Lenders, that Term SOFR is no longer representative (date of the the occurrence of such event shall be referred to as the “ Benchmark Replacement Date ”), then commencing on the next Determination Date as provided in the definition of “Term SOFR Rate”, the Index Rate hereunder shall be replaced with the first alternative set forth in the order that follows that can be determined by Administrative Agent as of the Benchmark Replacement Date (as applicable, the “ Benchmark Replacement ”): (a) Daily Simple SOFR; and (b) such alternate base rate and spread as Administrative Agent and all Lenders determine in their reasonable discretion (in consultation with Borrower) to be most comparable to the then-current interest rate.

[[A0643]]
The Index Rate based on the Benchmark Replacement shall initially be determined on the first Determination Date following the Benchmark Replacement Date and shall thereafter be adjusted on each subsequent Determination Date to be the applicable Benchmark Replacement determined by Administrative Agent to be in effect on such date.

[[A0644]]
If the Benchmark Replacement as determined pursuant to this section would be less than 50 basis points, the Benchmark Replacement will be deemed to equal 50 basis points for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

any whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof.

[[A0657]]

[[A0669]]
In addition, from and after an Event of Default, all Obligations shall bear
interest at the Default Rate.

[[A0670]]
(c)
Late Fee
.
If any payment of interest and/or principal is not received by Administrative Agent when such payment is due, then in addition
to the remedies conferred upon the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
- a late charge of 5% of the amount due and unpaid or $10.00, whichever is greater (the “
Late Fee
”), will
be added to the delinquent amount for any payment past due in excess of ten (10) days, regardless of any notice and cure periods,
and (ii) the amount due and unpaid (including the unpaid Late Fee) shall bear interest at the Default Rate, computed from the date
on which the amount was due and payable until paid.

[[A0671]]
Notwithstanding the foregoing the Late Fee will not apply to a balloon payment
of principal due upon the maturity of the Loan.

[[A0672]]
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (A) the Late Fee is not a penalty; (B) is
intended to compensate Administrative Agent and Lenders for the internal administrative costs and expenses of monitoring, handling
and processing late payments (including, for example, staff costs arising from internal and regulatory reporting of delinquencies,
additional underwriting analysis, in-house legal review, and credit committee reviews) over and above the economic costs associated
with the loss of use of money and out of pocket costs otherwise subject to reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents; (C) the amount of the Late Fee is a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm caused by the failure
to timely make the applicable payment; and (D) the actual damage is incapable or very difficult of accurate estimation.

[[A0673]]
(d)
Interest Payments

the credit facility provided pursuant to this Agreement, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable
on the date of such repayment, prepayment or termination.

[[/TABLE]]

[[A0677]]
(e)
Computation of
Interest
. Interest on the Obligations shall be computed on a 365/360 basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the interest
rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal
balance is outstanding.

[[A0678]]
All interest payable under the Loan is computed using this method.

[[A0679]]
This calculation method results in a
higher effective interest rate than the numeric interest rate stated in this Agreement.

[[A0680]]
By executing below, Borrower hereby acknowledges
and agrees to the calculation of interest in accordance with a year of 360 days and acknowledges that calculation of interest in
accordance with this paragraph will increase the Loan’s effective interest rate above the stated Interest Rate and Default
Rate, as applicable.

[[A0681]]
(f)
Advances for Interest
and Fees
. Borrower and Lenders hereby authorize Administrative Agent and Lenders to make Revolving Loans to pay interest accrued
on the Loan, notwithstanding that Borrower may not have requested a disbursement of such amount.

[[A0682]]
Administrative Agent or any Lender
may make such Revolving Loans notwithstanding that Borrower may be in default under the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document.

[[A0683]]
Nothing in this provision shall prevent Borrower from paying interest and fees from its own funds, or otherwise excuse
Borrower’s obligation to pay such interest and fees.

[[A0684]]
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to obligate Administrative
Agent or any Lender to make such disbursements to pay interest.

[[A0685]]
The authorization hereby granted shall be irrevocable and at Administrative
Agent’s discretion, and no further direction or authorization from Borrower shall be necessary for Administrative Agent to
make such disbursements on behalf of the Lenders.

Administrative Agent a written confirmation (including a written Draw Request), if such confirmation is requested by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by a Responsible Officer.

[[A0693]]
If the written confirmation differs in any material respect
from the action taken by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall govern
absent manifest error.

[[A0694]]
The Administrative Agent has no duty to monitor for Borrower or to report to Borrower the use of proceeds of Revolving

date thereof), and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to
each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender’s
Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.

[[A0751]]
Each Lender acknowledges and agrees
that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute, unconditional
and irrevocable and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, extension, reinstatement or
renewal of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments.

[[A0752]]
In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each L/C Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank promptly upon the request of the Issuing Bank at any time from the time of such L/C Disbursement until such L/C Disbursement is reimbursed by Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to Borrower for any reason, including after the Maturity Date.

[[A0753]]

[[A0757]]
Each Lender further acknowledges and agrees that its participation in each Letter of Credit will be automatically adjusted to reflect such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit at each time such Lender’s Commitment is amended pursuant to the operation of Section 2.13 , as a result of an assignment in accordance with Section 10.5

[[A0758]]

as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section),
it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under
this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such
indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount
paid over pursuant to this
Section 2.11(h)
(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

[[A0907]]
Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this
Section 2.11(h)
, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to
an indemnifying party pursuant to this
Section 2.11(h)
the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less
favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving
rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts
with respect to such Tax had never been paid.

[[A0908]]
This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available
its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other
Person.

.

discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.

[[A0910]]
2.12 Illegality; Inability to Determine Rates .

[[A0911]]
(a)
Illegality
.
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted it is unlawful, for
any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loan advances whose interest is determined by reference to
Term SOFR, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell,
or to take deposits of, U.S. Dollars in the London interbank eurodollar market, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to Borrower
(through Administrative Agent), any obligation of such Lender to make or maintain advances of the Loan at the Term SOFR Rate shall
be suspended, in each case until such Lender notifies Administrative Agent and Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
determination no longer exist, in which case the Loans will accrue interest at the Base Rate.

[[A0912]]
Upon receipt of such notice, all
Loans accruing interest based on the Term SOFR Rate will instead accrue interest at the Base Rate.

[[A0913]]
Upon any such prepayment or
conversion, Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

[[A0914]]
(b)
Inability to Determine
Rates
. If a Benchmark Replacement has not been implemented and Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining Term SOFR for proposed or
existing advances of the Loan, or (ii) Administrative Agent or Required Lenders determine that for any reason Term SOFR does not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Loan, Administrative Agent will promptly so notify Borrower
and each Lender.

[[A0915]]
Thereafter, the obligation of Lenders to make or maintain advances of the Loan at the Term SOFR Rate shall be
suspended, in each case until Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by Required Lenders described in
clause
(ii)
above, until Administrative Agent upon instruction of Required Lenders) revokes such notice.

[[A0916]]
During the period of such
suspension, all proposed advances and all amounts from day to day outstanding which are not past due, shall bear interest at a
fluctuating rate of interest per annum equal to the Base Rate.

Lending Installation for funding or booking its Revolving Loans hereunder, (ii) assign its rights and obligations hereunder to
another of its offices, branches or affiliates, or (iii) take such other actions as such Lender may deem reasonable, if, in the
judgment of such Lender, such designation, assignment or other action (A) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to

[[A0922]]
Section 2.10 or 2.11 , as the case may be, in the future, and (B) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

[[A0924]]
(b)
Replacement of
Lenders

in
the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented
to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.

[[A0934]]

[[A0935]]
Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, (A) any Lender that acts as an Issuing Bank may not be replaced hereunder at any time it has any Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements satisfactory to such Lender (including the furnishing of a backstop standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer, reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank or the depositing of cash collateral into a cash collateral account in amounts and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such Issuing Bank) have been made with respect to such outstanding Letter of Credit and (B) the Lender that acts as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms of Section 9.6 .
