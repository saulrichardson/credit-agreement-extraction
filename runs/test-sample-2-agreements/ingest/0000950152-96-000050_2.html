                           THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED
                    REVOLVING CREDIT AND TERM LOAN AGREEMENT

      THIS THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT AND TERM LOAN AGREEMENT
dated as of the 13th day of November, 1995 (the "Agreement"), is between DRUG
EMPORIUM, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), and BANK ONE, COLUMBUS,
NA (the "Bank"), and amends and restates in its entirety that certain Revolving
Credit Agreement dated as of February 14, 1992 between Borrower and the Bank as
(a) amended and restated by that certain First Amended and Restated Revolving
Credit and Term Loan Agreement dated as of January 4, 1994 between Borrower and
the Bank, (b) further amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 to First Amended
and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement dated as of November 11,
1994 between Borrower and the Bank and that certain Amendment No. 2 to First
Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement dated as of
February 25, 1995 between Borrower and the Bank, and (c) amended and restated by
that certain Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of
May 12, 1995 between Borrower and Bank.

      THE PARTIES HERETO, INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, hereby agree as
follows:

                                  SECTION 1

                   AMOUNT AND TERMS OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT

      1.1.  COMMITMENT OF THE BANK.

            1.1.1. Commitment. The Bank agrees, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and provided that no Event of Default or Default
(the definitions of these and other capitalized terms used herein having the
meanings provided in Section 10) then exists, to provide Credits to Borrower in
the form of Revolving Credit Loans from time to time on and after the date
hereof but prior to February 28, 1999 (the "Maturity Date") in respective
amounts selected by Borrower from time to time, provided that the aggregate
amount thereof at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the Commitment.

            1.1.2. Maximum Commitment. The amount of the Commitment shall equal
the lesser of the Borrowing Base or (a) $75,000,000 from the date hereof until
and including March 31, 1996 (the "Reduction Date") or (b) $45,000,000
thereafter. All provisions of this Agreement relating to reduction of the
Commitment, including the provisions of Section 1.2, shall apply to the
reduction of the Commitment provided for in this Section 1.1.2. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Borrower reduces the amount of the Commitment to $45,000,000
or less pursuant to Section 1.2 of this Agreement before March 31, 1996, then,
for purposes hereof, the "Reduction Date" shall be deemed to refer to the date
upon which such reduction actually took place. The maximum amount of all Credits
of the Bank to Borrower under this Section 1 at any one time outstanding shall
not exceed the total of the Commitment. For the purpose of computing the


<PAGE>   11



unused portion of the Commitment, the Bank shall treat as outstanding Credits
under this Agreement the undrawn face amount of outstanding Letters of Credit
issued from time to time hereunder at the request of Borrower. Upon repayment of
any outstanding Credit, the amount of such Credit will again be available for
reborrowing hereunder.

            1.1.3. Letters of Credit.

                  (a) Borrower may request a Letter of Credit by completing the
Bank's then standard application for a Letter of Credit (copy of current
standard application is attached as Exhibit 1.1.3) and delivering the
application to the Bank at least two Banking Days before the date on which the
Letter of Credit is to be issued. On the date the Letter of Credit is to be
issued, the Bank shall deliver the Letter of Credit to Borrower, or to the
Person designated by Borrower. No Letter of Credit shall be issued with an
expiration date (i) more than 180 days after the date of issuance, or (ii) after
the Maturity Date or which is payable in a currency other than United States
dollars. Except as otherwise provided herein, all the terms of the Letter of
Credit and such standard application shall govern the Letter of Credit.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, the face amount of
all Letters of Credit outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $5,000,000.

                  (b) Borrower shall immediately reimburse the Bank for the
amount paid on all drafts drawn under Letters of Credit issued hereunder. If,
notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Borrower should fail to so immediately
reimburse the Bank, then, in addition to any other remedy which the Bank may
have with respect to such failure, any amount paid by the Bank on any draft
under a Letter of Credit shall be treated as a Variable Rate Loan (bearing
interest at the rate set forth in Section 3.5 hereof with respect to Revolving
Credit Loans which have become due and payable) unless Borrower makes
alternative advance provision for the funding of such reimbursement satisfactory
to the Bank.

      1.2. CANCELLATION OR REDUCTION OF THE COMMITMENT BY BORROWER.

            1.2.1. Cancellation/Reduction. Before the Maturity Date, the then
unused aggregate Commitment may be canceled or may be reduced permanently from
time to time by Borrower in the amount of U.S. $1,000,000 or any larger amount
which is a whole multiple of U.S. $1,000,000 upon 10 Banking Days' written
notice to the Bank of Borrower's election to do so, which notice shall specify
the date when such cancellation or reduction shall be effective and on such
effective date, the Commitment shall be so canceled or reduced; provided that:

                   (a) any such cancellation or reduction shall be irrevocable;

                   (b) in the event of a cancellation of the Commitment,
      Borrower shall (i) pay in full all Commitment Fees due to the date of
      cancellation and (ii) pay all amounts outstanding under the Revolving
      Credit Note;

                   (c) in the event of a reduction of the Commitment to an
      amount less than the principal amount of the then outstanding Revolving
      Credit Loans and Letters of Credit, Borrower shall pay the Revolving 
      Credit Note so that the unpaid principal amount 

                                     2

      of the then outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and Letters of Credit does 
      not exceed the Commitment as so reduced; and 

                   (d) Borrower may not cancel, prepay or reduce LIBO Rate Loans
      unless Borrower first pays all fees, costs, penalties and premiums
      incurred by the Bank because of such cancellation, prepayment or
      reduction.

            1.2.2. Payment of Interest. All principal payments made pursuant to
this Section 1.2 shall be accompanied by the payment of accrued interest on such
principal to the date of such payment and such additional consideration as may
be required pursuant to Section 1.2.1(d).

      1.3. FEES.

            1.3.1. Commitment Fee. As consideration for the Commitment, Borrower
shall pay to the Bank a fee (the "Commitment Fee") on the daily average unused
portion of the aggregate Commitment at a rate per annum equal to 3/8 of 1% with
respect to the unused portion of the Commitment, commencing with the effective
date hereof. For the purpose of computing the unused portion of the aggregate
Commitment, the Bank shall treat as outstanding Credits under this Agreement the
undrawn face amount of outstanding Letters of Credit issued from time to time
hereunder at the request of Borrower. The Commitment Fee shall be calculated on
the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days. The
Commitment Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each
February, May, August and November.

            1.3.2. Letter of Credit Fees. Borrower shall pay to the Bank a
negotiation fee of 1/4 of 1% of the amount of each draft drawn under a Letter of
Credit. In addition, the Bank may charge Borrower its usual and customary
issuance and administration charges with respect to each Letter of Credit.

      1.4. LOANS.

            1.4.1. Forms of Loans. Each Revolving Credit Loan shall, at the
election of Borrower, be made either in the form of (a) a Variable Rate Loan
(individually a "Variable Rate Loan" and collectively the "Variable Rate
Loans"); or (b) with respect to only those Revolving Credit Loans made during a
LIBO Rate Period, a LIBO Rate Loan (individually a "LIBO Rate Loan" and
collectively the "LIBO Rate Loans"). Except as otherwise provided herein, each
Variable Rate Loan shall be in the initial principal amount of $300,000 or any
larger amount which is a whole multiple of $100,000. Each LIBO Rate Loan shall
be in the initial principal amount of $1,000,000 or any larger amount which is a
whole multiple of $100,000.

            1.4.2.  Borrowing Procedures.

                    (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, each Revolving 
Credit Loan shall be made pursuant to Borrower's written or telephonic request
to the Bank and shall specify (i) the total amount of the Loan; (ii) whether the
Loan is to be a Variable Rate Loan or, if available, a LIBO Rate Loan; (iii) the
borrowing date (the "Borrowing Date"), which shall be a Banking Day in the case
of a Variable Rate Loan or a LIBO Banking Day in the case of a LIBO Rate Loan;
and

                                       3

<PAGE>   13
(iv) in the case of a LIBO Rate Loan, that the Bank quote to Borrower on the
Trade Date the LIBO Rate for loans outstanding for one, two, three or six
months. Requests for Variable Rate Loans may be made prior to 12:00 noon on the
Borrowing Date. Requests for LIBO Rate Loans shall be made by 12:00 noon on the
Request Date.

                   (b) In the case of a request for a LIBO Rate Loan, the Bank
shall, no later than 11:00 a.m. on the Trade Date, notify Borrower of the LIBO
Rate applicable for the periods requested by Borrower. Borrower shall, no later
than 11:30 a.m. on the Trade Date, give notice to the Bank by telephone
confirmed by fax or otherwise in writing received on the next succeeding Banking
Day, whether it wishes (i) to complete such borrowing in the form of a LIBO Rate
Loan and, if so, the maturity date of such LIBO Rate Loan (which shall be either
one, two, three or six months from the Borrowing Date, but in no event later
than the Maturity Date); (ii) to make such borrowing as a Variable Rate Loan; or
(iii) to cancel its request for a Revolving Credit Loan. Failure by Borrower to
deliver notice to complete the borrowing by 11:30 a.m. on the Trade Date shall
constitute cancellation of such request.

                   (c) The proceeds of each Revolving Credit Loan will, subject
to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, promptly (but
at least by 3:00 p.m. of the Borrowing Date) be made available to Borrower by
the Bank by crediting or making a payment to the account of Borrower.

      1.5.  THE REVOLVING CREDIT NOTE.

            1.5.1. Form. The Revolving Credit Loans made by the Bank shall be
evidenced by a master promissory note of Borrower in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 1.5, with appropriate insertions (the "Revolving Credit Note"), payable
to the order of the Bank and representing the obligation of Borrower to pay the
amount of the Commitment or, if different, the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of all Revolving Credit Loans made by the Bank, with interest thereon as
prescribed in this Section 1.5. The Revolving Credit Note shall (a) be dated the
date of this Agreement; (b) be stated to mature on the Maturity Date; and (c)
bear interest at the applicable interest rate per annum as provided in, and
payable as specified in, this Section 1.5. Each Revolving Credit Loan made by
the Bank and each payment made on account of principal on the Revolving Credit
Note shall be recorded by the Bank on its books and records in the usual and
ordinary course of business, such ordinary course books and records to
constitute prima facie evidence in the absence of manifest error of the amount
of all Revolving Credit Loans and payments; provided, however, that the failure
of the Bank to make such recordation shall not limit or otherwise affect the
obligations of Borrower under the Revolving Credit Note.

            1.5.2. Interest on Variable Rate Loans. Each Variable Rate Loan
shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance of such Loan for each day
from the day such Loan is made until the Reduction Date at a fluctuating rate
per annum equal to the Prime Rate plus 50 basis points. Thereafter, each
Variable Rate Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal balance of such
Loan for each day from the day such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a
fluctuating rate per annum equal to either (a) the Prime Rate plus 50 basis
points or (b) the Prime Rate in the case of a Variable Rate Loan made during a
period when the most recent quarterly financial statements of Borrower indicate
both (i) a LIBO Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.05:1.00 or greater and

                                     4




<PAGE>   14





(ii) a LIBO Senior Leverage Ratio of 2.5:1.0 or less. Interest on all Variable
Rate Loans shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed
over a year of 360 days. Any change in the interest rate on a Variable Rate Loan
due to a change in the Prime Rate shall take effect, without notice to Borrower,
at the opening of business on the date of such change in the Prime Rate.
Interest on the Variable Rate Loans shall be payable quarterly on the last day
of each February, May, August and November commencing on the first such date
following the initial Variable Rate Loan.

            1.5.3. Interest on LIBO Rate Loans. Each LIBO Rate Loan shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount of such Loan for each day from the
day such Loan is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the
LIBO Rate as in effect on the applicable Trade Date. Borrower shall pay, with
respect to each LIBO Rate Loan, such additional amounts as shall be determined
pursuant to Section 1.6. Interest on each LIBO Rate Loan shall be payable at the
maturity of such Loan. Interest on all LIBO Rate Loans shall be calculated on
the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days.

            1.5.4. Additional Interest. For so long as the Bank, or any
participating bank, maintains reserves against any category of liabilities which
includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBO Rate Loans is
determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which
includes loans by a non-United States office of the Bank to United States
residents which the Bank, or such participating bank, determines in good faith
to be legally required, and as a result the cost to the Bank, or such
participating bank, of making or maintaining its LIBO Rate is determined by the
Bank, or such participating bank, in good faith to have increased, then the Bank
may require Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on
any LIBO Rate Loan of the Bank, additional interest on such LIBO Rate Loan at a
rate per annum equal to (a)(i) the applicable LIBO Rate divided by (ii) one
minus the Euro Reserve Percentage minus (b) the applicable LIBO Rate.

      1.6.  ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AND LIMITATIONS RELATING TO LIBO RATE LOANS.

            1.6.1.  Additions.  The additional provisions and limitations set 
forth below shall apply with respect to LIBO Rate Loans:

                   (a) Deposits Unavailable. If the Bank shall, in good faith,
determine that it is unable to reasonably ascertain the LIBO Rate or either the
Bank or any participating bank is unable to acquire Eurodollar deposits or
Eurocurrency deposits on reasonable terms in an amount sufficient to meet a
request for a LIBO Rate Loan, the Bank shall forthwith give notice thereof to
Borrower, whereupon, until the Bank notifies Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such unavailability no longer exist (which the Bank shall do upon
receiving notice thereof), the obligations of the Bank to make LIBO Rate Loans
shall be suspended. In such event, Borrower may request a Variable Rate Loan of
like amount without regard to the notice requirement of Section 1.4 or may
cancel such request.

                  (b) Illegality. The obligation of the Bank to make LIBO Rate
Loans hereunder shall be suspended (to the extent necessary to remove such
illegality or impossibility) if any change in any law, treaty, rule or
regulation, or in any interpretation thereof by any 

                                       5
<PAGE>   15

governmental authority charged with its administration (whether or not having
the force of law) including, without limitation, exchange controls, shall, in
the sole opinion of the Bank or any participating bank, make it unlawful or
impossible for such bank to comply with its obligation to make or maintain any
LIBO Rate Loan hereunder for the duration of such illegality or impossibility.
The Bank shall promptly notify Borrower of such suspension, whereupon, until the
Bank receives notice that such illegality or impossibility ceases to exist and
gives notice to Borrower thereof, the obligations of the Bank to make LIBO Rate
Loans shall be suspended. Borrower shall, upon receipt of notice from the Bank,
either (i) repay in full (or to the extent necessary to remove such illegality
or impossibility) the outstanding principal amount of all such LIBO Rate Loans,
plus accrued interest thereon or (ii) convert the applicable interest rate
payable with respect to such Loan to the interest rate payable on a similar
Variable Rate Loan (to the extent such rate is not illegal).

                  (c) Change in Law. If the Bank has LIBO Rate Loans outstanding
and there shall occur any change in applicable law, treaty, rule, regulation or
in any interpretation thereof by any governmental authority charged with its
administration (whether or not having the force of law) which (i) change
directly affects transactions in Eurodollars or Eurocurrencies, (ii) involves
new or additional taxes, reserves or deposit requirements in regard to the LIBO
Rate Loans or changes in the basis of taxation of payments on such Loans, or
(iii) if the LIBO Rate Loans made hereunder by the Bank were to have been
matched with Eurodollar or Eurocurrency deposits corresponding in amounts to
such LIBO Rate Loans and having maturity dates which are the same as such LIBO
Rate Loans regardless of whether or not such LIBO Rate Loans are in fact so
matched, increases the cost to the Bank or any participating bank of making or
maintaining the LIBO Rate Loans hereunder or reduces the amount of any payments
(whether of principal, interest, or otherwise) receivable by the Bank or any
participating bank as to any LIBO Rate Loans or requires the Bank or any
participating bank to make any payment on or calculated by reference to the
gross amount of any sum received by it as to such LIBO Rate Loans, then:

                      (A) the Bank shall promptly notify Borrower of the
                   occurrence of such event;

                      (B) the Bank shall promptly deliver to Borrower a
                   certificate stating the change which has occurred, together
                   with the date thereof and the amount of and the manner of
                   calculating the increased cost on any outstanding LIBO Rate
                   Loan; and

                      (C) upon receipt of such certificate from the Bank,
                   Borrower shall pay to the Bank within 10 days the amount or
                   amounts of such additional cost with respect to such
                   outstanding LIBO Rate Loan as additional compensation
                   hereunder.

                   (d) Certificate as to Payment. The certificate of the Bank as
to the additional amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.6.1(c) delivered to
Borrower shall (in the absence of manifest error in the transmission or
calculation) be conclusive evidence of the amount thereof. The protection of
this Section 1.6.1(d) shall be available to the Bank and any participating bank
regardless of any possible contention of invalidity or inapplicability of the
law,

                                     6




<PAGE>   16





regulation or condition which has been imposed. However, if Borrower has made a
payment of any additional amounts pursuant to Section 1.6.1(c) and any
subsequent event occurs which reduces the amount of the increased cost incurred
by the Bank or any participating bank, then the Bank shall promptly refund to
Borrower an amount equal to such reduction in the amount of increased cost.

                   (e) Substitution. If Borrower is required to pay to the Bank
any additional amounts pursuant to Section 1.6.1(c), Borrower shall be entitled,
upon giving the Bank not less than five days' written notice, in addition to its
other rights, to prepay all or any portion of an outstanding LIBO Rate Loan with
respect to which such additional amounts of payment are required (any
prohibition against prepayment of such Loans herein contained to the contrary
notwithstanding) by substituting a Variable Rate Loan of equal principal amount
for all or any such portion of the Loan. All such prepayments shall be
accompanied by payment of interest accrued to the date of such prepayments. As a
condition of such prepayments, Borrower shall promptly pay to the Bank upon the
Bank's written request such amount or amounts as in the reasonable good faith
business judgment of the Bank will compensate the Bank for any loss, premium or
penalty incurred by it because of such prepayment.

                   (f) Increased Costs. In addition to the other amounts payable
hereunder, Borrower shall pay to the Bank such additional amounts as shall
compensate the Bank and any participating Persons pursuant to Section 9 hereof
for increased costs which the Bank or such participating Person, reasonably and
in good faith determines to be allocable to LIBO Rate Loans. Additional amounts
payable under this Section 1.6.1(f) shall be paid by Borrower to the Bank on the
maturity of the respective LIBO Rate Loans, subject to receipt by Borrower from
the Bank of a certificate showing the amount and certifying to the correctness
thereof.

                   (g) Interest Period. With respect to LIBO Rate Loans, if the
interest period selected by Borrower (i) ends on a day which is not a LIBO
Banking Day, the period so selected shall be extended to the next succeeding
LIBO Banking Day unless such LIBO Banking Day falls in another calendar month,
in which case such interest period shall end on the next preceding LIBO Banking
Day; or (ii) begins on the last LIBO Banking Day of a calendar month (or on a
day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at
the end of such interest period), the period so selected shall end on the last
LIBO Banking Day of the calendar month; provided, however, that notwithstanding
(i) or (ii) above, no period may be selected which ends after the Maturity Date.

            1.6.2. Limitation. Charges or additional expenses or otherwise to
Borrower under Sections 1.2.1(d), 1.5.4 or 1.6.1 shall be subject to the
conditions that each is (a) the subject of notice given to Borrower by the Bank
within a reasonable time after the Bank determines that the same may exist; (b)
except as to the subjects of Section 1.2.1(d), the result of a change in law or
regulation or official interpretation thereof occurring after the date of
Closing; (c) not reflected in the determination of any other rate or charge
hereunder; and (d) (i) directly attributable and unique to the transactions
under this Agreement, or (ii) as to all the Bank's or any participating Person's
(pursuant to Section 9 hereof) customers similarly or analogously situated, (A)
passed through to or assessed against other customers to the extent the Bank or
such participating

                                        7




<PAGE>   17





Person is contractually empowered to do so and (B) is allocated among all such
customers (without reference to part (A) of this clause).

            1.6.3. Statement. The Bank's written statement to Borrower that
items under or covered by this Section 1.6 are properly chargeable to Borrower
under this Agreement, the general nature of those charges, and the amount
thereof shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. Except only to the extent
specifically set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, no charges or
additions under or covered by this Section 1.6 shall be payable, and no interest
shall accrue thereon, prior to the presentation of the statement described in
this Section 1.6.3.

      1.7. PREPAYMENTS AND RIGHT TO REBORROW. Outstanding Variable Rate Loans
may be prepaid in whole at any time or in part from time to time in an amount of
U.S. $300,000 or any larger amount which is a whole multiple of $100,000 (or
such lesser amount as constitutes the entire amount outstanding) without premium
or penalty. The LIBO Rate Loans may be prepaid only as provided for in Section
1.2 or Section 1.6.1(e). No prepayment of a Revolving Credit Loan shall affect
Borrower's right to reborrow from the Bank under the Revolving Credit Note
before the Maturity Date.

      1.8. BORROWING BASE. Borrower shall, from time to time, prepay Revolving
Credit Loans in such amounts as shall be necessary so that, at all times, the
sum of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Credit Loans is
less than or equal to the Borrowing Base as reflected on the most recent
Borrowing Base Certificate delivered hereunder. Any prepayment required as a
result of a reduced Borrowing Base shall be made within five Banking Days after
the delivery of the applicable Borrowing Base Certificate and shall be subject
to the provisions of Section 1.2.1(d) hereof. Borrower may, with the consent of
the Bank, which consent may be withheld for any reason or no reason, in lieu of
making such prepayment, deliver, within said five Banking Days, to the Bank,
such additional collateral as the Bank may request accompanied by such documents
as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by the Bank to protect the interests
of the Bank.

                                    SECTION 2

                                    TERM LOAN

      2.1. General. On the Reduction Date, providing that Borrower is not then
in default hereunder, the Bank shall make a term loan (the "Term Loan") to
Borrower in the amount of $15,000,000, which Term Loan will be evidenced by a
term note (the "Term Note"). The Revolving Credit Loans and the Term Loan are
herein collectively called the "Loans" and the Revolving Credit Note and the
Term Note are herein collectively called the "Notes".

      2.2.  Term Note.  The Term Loan shall be evidenced by a Term Note of 
Borrower in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 2.2 executed by duly authorized
officers thereof on the Reduction Date. The Term Note shall include the
following terms:

                                     8




<PAGE>   18






            2.2.1. The Term Note shall be dated as of the Reduction Date and
shall be due and payable in full on or before February 28, 2001 (the
"Termination Date").

            2.2.2. Unless Borrower has elected, from time to time, in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.2.3 to cause all or a portion of the Term Note
to bear interest at a LIBO Rate, the Term Note shall bear interest on the unpaid
principal balance thereof calculated on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed over a year of 360 days on the unpaid principal balance thereof at a
fluctuating rate per annum equal to either (a) the Prime Rate plus 50 basis
points or (b) during a period when the most recent quarterly financial
statements of Borrower indicate both (i) a LIBO Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of
1.05:1.00 or greater and (ii) a LIBO Senior Leverage Ratio of 2.5:1.0 or less,
the Prime Rate. Any change in the interest rate due to a change in the Prime
Rate shall take effect, without notice to Borrower, at the opening of business
on the date of the change in the Prime Rate.

            2.2.3. Borrower may elect, from time to time during a LIBO Rate
Period, to have all or a portion of the Term Note bear interest at the LIBO Rate
by providing a request therefor to the Bank not later than 12:00 noon, on the
Request Date, which request shall specify (a) the effective date of the LIBO
Rate (the "Effective Date"), which shall be a LIBO Banking Day, (b) the
principal amount of the Term Note to bear interest at the LIBO Rate which shall
not be less than U.S. $1,000,000 or any larger amount which is a whole multiple
of U.S.$100,000 and (c) the interest period during which the LIBO Rate is to be
in effect, which may be for one, two, three or six months (provided that the
interest period shall not be so long as to be inconsistent with Borrower's
obligations to make payments as anticipated by Section 2.2.6). The Bank shall,
not later than 11:00 a.m. on the Trade Date, give notice to Borrower of the LIBO
Rate applicable for the period requested by Borrower. Borrower shall, not later
than 11:30 a.m. on the Trade Date, give notice by telephone confirmed by fax or
otherwise in writing to be received by the Bank on the next succeeding Banking
Day to the Bank as to whether or not Borrower elects to have all or a portion of
the Term Note bear interest at the LIBO Rate commencing as of the Effective Date
for the interest period so selected. If Borrower elects not to have all or any
part of the Term Note bear interest at the LIBO Rate or fails to deliver such
notice of election in a timely manner, the Term Note shall continue to bear
interest at the rate set forth in Section 2.2.2 and such portion of the Term
Loan bearing interest at a LIBO Rate shall, upon expiration of the period
selected for such LIBO Rate, bear interest at such rate. Each election to have a
portion of the Term Note bear interest at the LIBO Rate shall be recorded and
endorsed by the Bank on its books and records; provided, however, that the
failure of the Bank to make such recordation shall not limit or otherwise affect
the obligations of Borrower under the Term Note.

            2.2.4. As used in this Section 2, "LIBO Rate" shall have the meaning
and shall be calculated as provided in Section 10 of this Agreement; provided,
however, (a) the term "Effective Date" shall be substituted for references
therein to "date of each LIBO Rate Loan" and "date of such LIBO Rate Loan", (b)
the term "the period specified pursuant to Section 2.2.3(c) of the Agreement
during which the LIBO Rate is to be in effect" shall be substituted for
references therein to "a like period as such LIBO Rate Loan" and (c) the term
"principal amount of the Term Note to bear interest at the LIBO Rate" shall be
substituted for references therein to "amount of such LIBO Rate Loan."

                                        9




<PAGE>   19






            2.2.5. Interest on the portion of the Term Note bearing interest at
the rate set forth at Section 2.2.2 shall be payable in arrears on the last day
of each February, May, August and November. Interest on the portion of the Term
Note bearing interest at the LIBO Rate shall be payable at the maturity of the
interest period selected.

            2.2.6. Principal payments on the Term Note shall be due and payable
in consecutive quarterly installments on the last day of each February, May,
August and November commencing May 31, 1996, with each of the first 19
installments thereof equal to $750,000 and the last installment for the balance
thereof.

      2.3. Prepayment of Term Note. The principal portion of the Term Note
bearing interest based on the Prime Rate may be prepaid, at the option of
Borrower, in an amount of $300,000 or any larger amount which is a whole
multiple of $100,000 (or such lesser amount as constitutes the entire amount
outstanding), at any time or from time to time, without premium or penalty, by
giving written, telegraphic or oral notice to the Bank not later than 12:00 noon
on the Banking Day on which such prepayment is to be made. When such notice of
prepayment has been given to the Bank, the applicable principal amount of the
Term Note shall become due and payable on the designated prepayment date. All
prepayments will be applied to the Term Loan in the inverse order of maturity.
No prepayment of any portion of the principal of the Term Note that bears
interest at the LIBO Rate shall be permitted during the effective period of such
LIBO Rate for any reason or in any amounts, unless Borrower first pays all fees,
costs, penalties and premiums incurred by the Bank because of such prepayment.
Such prepayments may not be reborrowed.

      2.4. Additional Provisions and Limitations Relating to Term Note when LIBO
Rate is in Effect. The additional provisions and limitations set forth below
shall apply to the Term Note when the LIBO Rate is in effect.

            2.4.1. If the Bank shall, prior to any Effective Date, in good faith
determine that it is unable to ascertain the LIBO Rate or either the Bank or any
participating bank is unable to acquire Eurodollar deposits on reasonable terms
in an amount sufficient to meet a request for a LIBO Rate Loan hereunder, the
Bank shall forthwith give notice thereof to Borrower, whereupon until the Bank
notifies Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such unavailability no
longer exist (which the Bank shall do upon receiving notice thereof), the Term
Loan shall bear interest at the applicable rate as set forth in Section 2.2.2.

            2.4.2. The provisions of Sections 1.6.1(b) through (g) of this
Agreement shall be applicable to the Term Note when and to the extent bearing
interest at the LIBO Rate and the term "LIBO Rate Loan(s)" as used therein for
purposes of this Section 2.4.2. will be deemed to refer to the Term Note and the
principal balance thereof which bears interest at the LIBO Rate.

                                    SECTION 3

                                  GENERAL TERMS

      3.1. PAYMENTS. Borrower shall make all payments of principal, interest and
additional compensation on each Note issued hereunder and Commitment Fees to the
Bank as payee at the Bank's main office, 100 East Broad Street, Columbus, Ohio,
in immediately available funds prior to 12:00 noon, on the date such payments
shall become due in accordance with the terms hereof and of each Note.

      3.2. PAYMENT ON NON-BANKING DAYS. Subject to the provisions of Section
1.6.1(g), whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on
a day other than a Banking Day, such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Banking Day and such extension of time shall in such case be included
in the computation of payment of interest hereunder or the Commitment Fees
hereunder, as the case may be.

      3.3. SETOFFS. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Bank shall
have the right to setoff against all obligations of Borrower to the Bank
hereunder and under the Notes, whether matured or unmatured, all amounts owing
to Borrower by the Bank, whether or not then due and payable, and all other
funds or property of Borrower on deposit with or otherwise held by or in the
custody of the Bank for the beneficial account of Borrower, except for deposit
accounts that contain only (a) payroll funds, (b) employee benefit plan funds,
(c) tax deposits or (d) other funds which are not beneficially owned by
Borrower. Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any holder of a participation in a Note may exercise rights
of setoff or counterclaim, and any other rights with respect to such
participation, as fully as if the holder of the participation were a direct
creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

      3.4. CAPITAL ADEQUACY. If, after the date hereof, there occurs any change
in any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any
change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by
any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Bank, or any
participating bank, with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on the Bank's, or the participating bank's, capital as a direct consequence of
its obligations hereunder to a level below that which the Bank, or the
participating bank, could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration the Bank's, or participating bank's,
policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by the Bank, or
the participating bank, to be material, then, from time to time, within 15 days
after demand by the Bank, Borrower shall pay to the Bank such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate the Bank for such reduction. If Borrower is
required to pay to the Bank any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.4,
Borrower shall be entitled, upon giving the Bank not less than five days'
written notice, in addition to its other rights, to prepay all or any portion of
an outstanding Loan with respect to which such additional amounts are due, any
provision herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding (all such prepayments
shall be with interest accrued to the date of such prepayments). As a condition
of

                                       11
<PAGE>   21

such prepayments, Borrower shall promptly pay to the Bank upon the Bank's
written request such amount or amounts as, in the reasonable judgment of the
Bank, will compensate the Bank, or any participating bank, for such prepayment
in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.6.1(e).

      3.5. FAILURE TO PAY; INTEREST AFTER MATURITY. Whenever any principal
payment to be made on a LIBO Rate Loan shall become due and payable, whether or
not at the stated maturity thereof, and Borrower fails to make such principal
payment, the unpaid amount shall be deemed to be a Variable Rate Loan hereunder.
Unpaid (a) interest on any Note, or (b) principal on any Loan, shall, after
becoming due and payable, bear interest at the Prime Rate plus 1%. If any such
unpaid payment represents the required payment to be made on a LIBO Rate Loan,
Borrower shall be liable for all the costs, premiums, fees and penalties
incurred by the Bank due to such non-payment pursuant to Section 1.6.1(e), which
amounts shall be due and payable within 10 days after demand by the Bank and
which amounts shall bear interest at the Prime Rate plus 1%.

considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

      5.5. NO VIOLATION. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by

and reserves on the books of Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect to income

investments.

      5.18. INSURANCE. All of the properties and operations of Borrower and the
Subsidiaries of a character usually insured by Persons of established reputation
engaged in the same or a similar business similarly situated are adequately
insured, by reputable insurers duly licensed by appropriate state authorities
against loss or damage of the kinds and in the amounts customarily insured
against by such Persons; and Borrower and each Subsidiary carry, with such
insurers in customary amounts, such other insurance, including public liability
insurance, as is usually carried by Persons of established reputation engaged in
the same or a similar business similarly situated. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Borrower shall at all times: (a) furnish to the Bank, upon
request, a statement of its insurance coverage, in form and detail satisfactory
to the Bank; (b) require each policy of insurance to contain a provision whereby
it cannot be canceled, amended or modified except after 30 days' prior written
notice to the Bank; (c) require each policy of insurance covering any of the
Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement or any Subsidiary Security
Agreement) to be written or endorsed so as to make losses, if any, payable to
the Bank, in addition to the Borrower; and (d) require each policy of insurance
covering any of the Collateral to contain an agreement by the insurer that any
loss shall be payable to the Bank notwithstanding any act or negligence of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary which might otherwise result in forfeiture of said
insurance. If the Borrower fails to pay or cause to be paid the premium on any
such insurance, the Bank may, in its sole discretion, do so for the account of
the Borrower, and Borrower shall reimburse the Bank for the cost thereof on
demand.

      5.19. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. There are, to the best of Borrower's
knowledge, no materials, presently located on any real property owned by, leased
to or operated by Borrower or any Subsidiary, which are radioactive or which are
toxic and which under federal, state or local law, statute, ordinance or
regulations, or court or administrative order or decree, or private agreement
for which Borrower or a Subsidiary is legally responsible for compliance (the
"Environmental Requirements") or require special handling in collection,
storage, treatment or disposal ("Hazardous Materials") which are not being
handled in accordance with the Environmental Requirements and to the best
knowledge of Borrower, no part of such real property has been contaminated by
any Hazardous Materials.

      5.20. SOLVENCY. Borrower and the Subsidiaries are able to meet their debts
as they become due. The present fair saleable value of the property and assets
of Borrower and the Subsidiaries is greater than the amount required to pay all
Indebtedness of Borrower and the Subsidiaries, including the Indebtedness
incurred under this Agreement.

                              AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

      Until all Loans, amounts due or which could in the future become due under

maintain its corporate existence, rights, franchises and privileges in the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, and qualify and remain qualified in good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the failure to
preserve and maintain such existence, rights, franchises, privileges and

Documents. Borrower will engage and cause the Subsidiaries to engage primarily
in the Core Business.

      6.3.  AUDITS. Borrower shall and shall cause each of the Subsidiaries to,

in clause (a) next above, and to discuss matters relating to such company's
performance hereunder or such company's business, operations and financial

of such matters and who are then available. The costs of such examinations shall
be borne by Borrower up to $10,000 in any fiscal year. Borrower agrees to use
reasonable efforts to make such officers and employees available at such time or
at another mutually agreeable time. In addition to the foregoing, Borrower
agrees to allow the Bank to perform inventory audits by an independent
accounting firm chosen by the Bank with respect to Borrower's and its
Subsidiaries' retail stores; provided, however, that only one such audit shall

interest to the Bank in Accounts, Equipment and Inventory and that the

       Section 3.  Representations and Warranties.  The Company hereby
represents and warrants to the Bank that:

               3.1.  Title to Collateral.  The Company has good, indefeasible
and marketable title to all the Collateral free of all Liens other than those
granted hereby, except for Liens of landlords under state statutes or Liens
permitted under the Loan Agreement.  No financing or continuation statement
which names the Company as debtor has been filed in any state or other
jurisdiction except as provided for herein or as set forth on Schedule 3.1
hereto, and the Company has not agreed or consented to cause or to permit in
the future (upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of the
Collateral, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien.

               3.2.  Perfection of Lien.  The Company has taken or caused to be
taken all actions necessary to establish the Bank's Lien in the Collateral as a
valid, enforceable and perfected Lien, first and prior to all other Liens

records of the Company concerning the Collateral are accurate, complete and
maintained in accordance with GAAP.  The Collateral Locations Exhibit correctly
sets forth the address of (a) the chief executive office, registered office and
principal place of business of the Company, (b) any plant or division of the
Company maintaining a separate principal place of business, registered office
or chief executive office, (c) all other places of business of the Company and
the location of all Collateral and (d) the name and business address of each
landlord and mortgagee with any interest in any Collateral Location.  The only
original books of account and records of the Company relating to any Accounts
of the Company are, and will continue to be, kept at the offices of the Company
set forth on the Collateral Locations Exhibit opposite the name of the division
or the plant of the Company where such Accounts originated.  The only locations
at which Equipment  and Inventory are located are set forth on the Collateral
Locations Exhibit opposite the name of the division or the plant of the Company
or other location where such Equipment  and Inventory are located.

               3.4.  Accounts.  The Accounts arose out of bona fide sales or
services, are collectible in the ordinary course of business and are not
disputed or subject to offset.

       Section 4.  Affirmative Covenants.  On and after the date of this
Agreement and until all of the Obligations shall have been paid and discharged
in full or otherwise satisfied and the Company shall no longer have any right
to request any Loans under the Loan Agreement:


                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>   60
               4.1.  Insurance.  The Company shall at all times:  (a) maintain
or cause to be maintained insurance upon the Collateral with responsible and
reputable insurers of such character and in such amounts as are usually
maintained by Persons engaged in a like business; (b) furnish to the Bank,
prior to the execution of this Agreement and annually thereafter certificates
of  insurance with respect to all insurance policies required to be maintained
hereunder, in form and detail satisfactory to the Bank; (c) require each policy
of insurance to contain a provision whereby it cannot be canceled, amended or
modified except after 30 days' prior written notice to the Bank; (d) require
each policy of insurance covering any of the Collateral to be written or
endorsed so as to make losses, if any, payable to the Bank, in addition to the
Company; and (e) require each policy of insurance covering any of the
Collateral to contain an agreement by the insurer that any loss shall be
payable to the Bank notwithstanding any act or negligence of the Company which
might otherwise result in forfeiture of said insurance.  If the Company fails
to pay or cause to be paid the premium on any such insurance, the Bank may, in
its sole discretion, do so for the account of the Company, add the cost thereof
to the Obligations and be reimbursed by the Company therefor on demand.

               4.2.  Notice of Default.  If any Default or Event of Default
occurs, the Company shall give prompt notice of such happening to the Bank.

               4.3.  Inspection.  The Company shall permit any Person
designated by the Bank to enter, examine, audit and inspect the Collateral and
all properties, corporate books and financial records pertaining to the
Collateral, or the operation, business, affairs and financial condition of the
Company at any reasonable time and from time to time, and shall permit such
Persons to copy and make excerpts of such books and records.

               4.4.  Sale of Inventory.  Notwithstanding the security interest
in the Collateral granted hereunder, the Company shall have the right to sell,
lease or otherwise dispose of its Inventory in the ordinary course of its
business, free and clear of such security interest; but, in such event, such
security interest shall continue in the proceeds of such sale, lease or other
disposition.

               4.5.  Company's Rights to Collect Accounts.  Notwithstanding the
security interest in the Accounts granted under this Agreement, the Company
shall endeavor to collect the Accounts at its own cost and expense, until such
time as the Bank shall have notified the Company, pursuant to Section 4.6, that
the Bank has revoked the Company's right to collect the Accounts.

               4.6.  Collection of Accounts by the Bank.  If an Event of
Default shall have occurred, the Bank shall have the right at any time and
without affecting the liability of the Company to the Bank (a) to revoke any
right of the Company to collect its Accounts, pursuant to Section 4.5, by
written notice to the Company to such effect, (b) to take over and direct
collection of the Accounts of the Company, (c) to give notice of the security
interest of the Bank in the Accounts to any or all of the Customers, (d) to
give notice to the Customers to make payment of the Accounts directly to the
Bank (and, at the request of the Bank, the Company shall


                                     - 5 -
<PAGE>   61
indicate on all billings to Customers that payments thereon are to be made to
the Bank), and (e) to take control of the Accounts of the Company and the
Proceeds thereof, and to take possession of all of the Company's books and
records relating thereto, with full power and authority in the name of the Bank
or of the Company to enforce, collect, sue for, receive, compromise, settle and
give receipts for any and all of the Accounts.  If any Account becomes
evidenced by a promissory note, trade acceptance, chattel paper or other
writing or instrument for the payment of money, and there is at the time a
Default, the Company shall, at the request of the Bank, promptly deliver any
such instrument to the Bank duly endorsed to the order of the Bank as
additional Collateral under this Agreement.  It is understood and agreed by the
Company that the Bank shall have no liability whatsoever to the Company under
this Section 4.6.

               4.7.  Account Verification.  The Bank may at any time, without
notice to the Company, verify with any Customer the status of any Account
payable by such Customer; provided, however, that, prior to the occurrence of
an Event of Default, no request for verification shall be made in the name of
the Bank, nor shall the Bank disclose the purpose of such request.  The Company
from time to time will execute and deliver such instruments and take all such
action as the Bank may reasonably request in order to effectuate the purpose of
this Section 4.7.

               4.8.  Preservation and Protection of Security Interests.  The
Company shall faithfully preserve and protect the Bank's security interest in
the Collateral and shall, at its own cost and expense, cause such security
interest to be perfected and continue perfected so long as the Obligations or
any portion thereof are outstanding and unpaid, and for such purpose the
Company shall from time to time at the request of the Bank file or record, or
cause to be filed or recorded, such instruments, documents and notices,
including without limitation financing and continuation statements, as the Bank
may deem necessary or advisable from time to time in order to preserve, perfect
and continue perfected said security interest.  The Company shall do all such
other acts and things and shall execute and deliver all such other instruments
and documents, including without limitation further security agreements,
pledges, endorsements, assignments and notices, as the Bank may deem necessary
or advisable from time to time in order to perfect and preserve the priority of
said security interest as a perfected first Lien in the Collateral prior to the
rights of any other secured party or lien creditor.  The Bank, and its
officers, employees and authorized agents, or any of them, are hereby
irrevocably appointed the attorneys-in-fact of the Company to do all acts and
things which the Bank may deem necessary or advisable to preserve, perfect and
continue perfected the Bank's security interest in the Collateral, including
without limitation the signing of financing, continuation or other similar
statements and notices on behalf of the Company.

               4.9.  Maintenance of Collateral.  The Company shall (a) from
time to time replace and repair all parts of the Collateral which are or become
worn, broken, damaged, or deteriorated, maintain the Collateral now or
hereafter owned or acquired by it, and every part thereof, in good working
order and repair and pay the costs of such repairs, replacements, and
maintenance as well as any costs of storing the same; and (b) pay and discharge
all taxes, assessments, fees, and other governmental charges or levies imposed
upon it or any of the Collateral as well as all lawful claims of materialmen,
mechanics, carriers, warehousemen, landlords and other similar Persons


                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>   62
for labor, materials, supplies and rentals which, if unpaid, might by law
become a Lien on the Collateral or any part thereof.  If the Company fails to
make any payments it is required to make under this Section 4.9, the Bank may
do so for the account of the Company and may add the amount of such payments to
the Obligations.

               4.10.  Inventory.  The Company shall maintain the Inventory in
good condition, salable at the Company's normal prices in the ordinary course
of its business.

               4.11.  New Stores.  Prior to the opening of any retail store not
presently operated by the Company or any Subsidiary, the Company shall give
written notice to the Bank and shall perform, and cause each of the
Subsidiaries to perform, such acts as may be necessary or advisable to grant to
the Bank a perfected Lien, subject to no other Liens other than Liens permitted
under the Loan Agreement, in the Collateral located or to be located in such
new retail store.

               4.12.  Annual Certificate.  The Company shall furnish to the
Bank within 45 days after the close of each fiscal year, a certificate of the
chief financial officer or controller of the Company certifying that he has
reviewed the locations where the Equipment and Inventory are located and that
appropriate filings have been made for the Company and each Subsidiary so that
the Bank continues to have a perfected Lien hereunder, subject to no other Lien
other than Liens permitted under the Loan Agreement.

               4.13.  Removal of the Equipment.

                        4.13.1.  If no Event of Default shall have occurred, in
any instance where the Company in its discretion determines that any items of
the Equipment have become inadequate, obsolete, worn out, unsuitable,
undesirable or unnecessary, Company may remove such items of the Equipment from
any Collateral Location and sell, trade-in, exchange or otherwise dispose of
them (as a whole or in part) without any responsibility or accountability to
Bank, provided, however that Company shall either:

                                (a)  Substitute and install anywhere on such
Collateral Location other machinery, furnishing, equipment or related property
having equal or greater value (but not necessarily having the same function) in
the operation of its business for the purpose for which it is intended;
provided, further, however such removal and substitution shall not be out of
the ordinary course of business, all of which substituted machinery,
furnishings, Equipment or related property shall be free of all liens (other
than Permitted Liens) and shall become a part of the Collateral; or

                                (b)  Not make any such substitution and
installation; provided, further, however that in the case of (i) the sale of
any such Equipment to anyone other than itself or the scrapping thereof, or
(ii) the trade-in of such Equipment for other machinery on such Collateral
Location, Company shall use the proceeds of such sale for the reduction of the
Obligations.

removal, substitution, sale or other disposition of Equipment described in
Section 4.13.1 above and shall pay to Bank such amounts as are required by the
provisions of Section 4.13.1 (b) promptly after the sale, trade-in or other

otherwise satisfied and the Company shall no longer have the right to request
Loans under the Loan Agreement:

suffer to exist or agree or consent to cause or permit in the future (upon the
happening of a contingency or otherwise) to be created, assumed, incurred or to
exist any Lien upon any of the Collateral (other than Permitted Liens) except
with the prior written consent of the Bank to each such Lien.

corporate name unless, before the effective date of such change, the Company
delivers to the Bank such financing statements executed by the Company that the
Bank may request to reflect such name change, together with such other
documents and instruments that the Bank may request in connection with such
name change.  The Company shall not hold its right, title or interest in, nor
maintain its records relating to, any Collateral in any name other than its
corporate name.

       Section 6.  Application of Moneys.

               6.1.  Payments.  Except as otherwise provided herein, all monies
which the Bank shall receive either upon realization of the Lien granted
hereunder or otherwise may be applied by or at the direction of the Bank as
follows:

                        6.1.1.  First, to the payment or reimbursement of all
reasonable advances, expenses and disbursements of the Bank (including, without
limitation, the fees and disbursements of its counsel and agents) incurred in
connection with the administration and enforcement of, or the preservation of
any rights under, this Agreement or the Loan Documents or in the collection of
the Obligations.

                        6.1.2.  Second, to the payment of the then existing
Senior Obligations, matured and unmatured, in such order and in such manner as
the Bank may elect.

the Obligations, any remaining funds shall be paid by the Bank to the Company.

               6.2.  Reserved Rights.  The Bank shall have the continuing and
exclusive right to apply or reverse and re-apply any and all payments to any
portion of the Obligations.  To the extent that the Company makes a payment or
payments to the Bank or the Bank receives any payment or proceeds of the
Collateral for the Company's benefit, which payment(s) or proceeds or any part
thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party under any bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law or
equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the
Obligations or the part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and
continue in full force and effect as if such payment or proceeds had not been
received by the Bank.

       Section 7.  Events of Default and Remedies.

               7.1.  Rights on Event of Default.

                        7.1.1.  Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default,
the Bank shall have the right, upon notice to the Company, (except that upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 8(h) or 8(i) of the Loan
Agreement, no notice shall be required) to declare the Obligations immediately
due and payable and may, without demand of performance or other demand,
advertisement or notice of any kind to or upon the Company or any other Person
(all and each of which demands, advertisements and/or notices are hereby
expressly waived), forthwith exercise such rights and remedies as are provided
by the UCC and such other rights and remedies in


                                     - 9 -
<PAGE>   65
respect thereof as it may have at law or in equity or under any of the Loan
Documents, including without limitation the right to enter any premises where
any of the Collateral is located and take possession of the same without demand
or notice and without prior judicial hearing or legal proceedings, which the
Company hereby expressly waives, and to sell all or any portion of the
Collateral at public or private sale, without prior notice to the Company
except as otherwise required by law (and, if notice is required by law, after
10 days prior written notice), at such place or places and at such time or
times and in such manner and upon such terms, whether for cash or on credit, as
the Bank in its sole discretion may determine.  Upon any such sale of any of
the Collateral, the Bank may purchase all or any of the Collateral being sold,
free from any equity or right of redemption.  The Bank shall apply the proceeds
of any such sale as provided in Section 6.  If such proceeds are insufficient
to pay the amounts required by law, the Company shall be liable for any
deficiency in the amount so realized from the Collateral.

                        7.1.2.  The Company shall promptly pay or reimburse all
costs and expenses of the Bank and any participating Persons, as such Persons
are contemplated by Section 9 of the Loan Agreement, including, but not limited
to, attorneys' fees, incurred with respect to the enforcement or preservation
of any of the Bank's rights hereunder.

                        7.1.3.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
the Company hereby waives presentment, demand, protest or any notice (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) of any kind in connection with this
Agreement or any Collateral.

                        7.1.4.  The Bank shall not incur any liability as a
result of the sale of any Collateral, or any part thereof, at any private sale
conducted in a commercially reasonable manner, in compliance with any
applicable law.  The Company hereby waives any claims against the Bank arising
by reason of the fact that the price at which any of the Collateral may have
been sold at such a private sale was less than the price which might have been
obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the
Obligations, even if the Bank accepts the first offer received and does not
offer any Collateral to more than one offeree, provided that the Bank has acted
in a commercially reasonable manner in conducting such private sale.

                        7.1.5.  Upon any sale of all or any part of any
Collateral made either under the power of sale given hereunder or under
judgment or decree in any judicial proceedings for foreclosure or otherwise for
the enforcement of this Agreement, the Bank is hereby irrevocably appointed the
true and lawful attorney of the Company, in its name and stead, to make all
necessary deeds, bills of sale and instruments of assignment, and transfer or
conveyance of the property thus sold.  For that purpose, the Bank may execute
all such documents and instruments.  This power of attorney shall be deemed
coupled with an interest, and the Company hereby ratifies and confirms all that
its said attorney, or its substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do by
virtue of this Agreement.  If so requested by the Bank or by any purchaser of
the Collateral or a portion thereof, the Company shall further ratify and
confirm any such sale or transfer by executing and delivering to the Bank or to
such purchaser or purchasers at the Company's expense all reasonable and proper
deeds, bills of sale, instruments of assignment, conveyance or transfer and
releases as may be designated in any such request.

<PAGE>   66
                        7.1.6.  When authorized in accordance with this Section
7.1, the Bank may proceed to realize upon the security interest in the
Collateral against any one or more of the types of Collateral, at any one time
or from time to time, as the Bank shall determine in its sole discretion,
subject to the provisions of this Section 7.1.  The Bank shall not be required
to realize upon any one type of Collateral before proceeding to realize upon
the security interest granted in any other type of Collateral.  The proceeds of
any sale of, or other realization upon, or other receipt from, all or any
Collateral shall be applied by the Bank in the manner set forth in Section 6
hereof.

               7.2.  Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission Not a Waiver.  To
the extent permitted by law and not otherwise provided to the contrary under
this Agreement, no remedy given hereunder to the Bank shall be exclusive of any
other remedy, and every such remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to
every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter given by statute, law,
equity or otherwise to the extent not contrary to or inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement.  The Bank may, in its absolute discretion, exercise
all or any of the powers, rights or remedies given to it hereunder or which may
be now or hereafter given by statute, law or equity or otherwise.  No course of
dealing between the Company and the Bank or any delay or omission of the Bank
to exercise any right, remedy or power accruing upon any Default or Event of
Default shall impair any right, remedy or power or shall be construed to be a
waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or of any right of the Bank or
acquiescence therein, and every right, remedy and power given by this Agreement
to the Bank may, to the extent permitted by law, be exercised from time to time

           2.2. Pledge of Collateral. As security for the full and timely
payment or performance of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof,
the Company, by these presents, does hereby grant and pledge unto the Bank, and
its successors and assigns, all of the Company's right, title and interest in
and to the following property (the "Collateral"):

                 2.2.1. The Initial Collateral and such other Eligible
Collateral as shall hereafter be actually delivered by the Company to the Bank
in substitution for or in addition to the Initial Collateral pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement;

                 2.2.2.  The Collateral Proceeds;

                 2.2.3.  Any other property and, to the extent provided in this
Agreement, the proceeds thereof that may, from time to time hereafter, be
subject to the Lien of this Agreement; and

                 2.2.4.  All powers and appurtenant rights of the Company in the
property listed in Sections 2.2.1 through 2.2.3 above.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.2, all security interests
created hereunder which secure Senior Obligations shall be prior in interest to
all security interests created hereunder which secure Junior Obligations.

     Section 3. Collateral Maintenance.

           3.1. Holding of Collateral. Prior to the occurrence of any Event of
Default, all Collateral shall be held by the Bank in the name of the Company
endorsed or signed in blank or in favor of the Bank. After the occurrence of any
Event of Default, any or all of the Collateral may be registered in the name of
the Bank or any nominee of the Bank. The Bank may deliver any of the Collateral
to the issuers thereof for the purpose of making denominational exchanges or
registrations or transfers or for such other purpose in furtherance and pursuant
to the provisions of this Agreement as the Bank may deem advisable. The Company
will deliver promptly (but not later than three Banking Days after receipt of a
written request from the Bank) to the Bank such other documents and certificates
as the Bank may reasonably request in connection with subjecting any Collateral
and Collateral Proceeds to the Lien of this Agreement.

           3.2. Voting Rights. Prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default,
the Company shall have the right to vote and give consents with respect to the
Collateral, to consent to, ratify action taken at, or waive notice of, any
meeting with respect to the Collateral and to exercise all other stockholders'
rights and privileges with respect to the Collateral with the same force and
effect as if the Collateral was not subject to this Agreement; provided,
however, that no vote shall be cast nor shall any consent, waiver or
ratification be given or action taken which would be inconsistent with any of
the provisions of this Agreement or would cause, or approve any action that
would cause, the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default. After the
occurrence of any Event of Default, the Bank shall have all voting rights and
all other stockholders' rights and privileges with respect to the Collateral
with the same force and effect as if it was the absolute owner and record holder
thereof. The Company shall execute and deliver to the Bank all such proxies,
powers of attorney and other instruments as the Bank may request for the purpose
of enabling it to exercise its rights under this Section 3.2.

           3.3.  Payments on Collateral.  Prior to the occurrence of any Event 
of Default, and subject to Section 3.4 hereof, all payments on or with respect
to any Collateral shall be made to the Company. After the occurrence of an Event
of Default, the Bank shall have the right to take or direct all actions which it
deems necessary, desirable or appropriate to cause all payments on or with
respect to any Collateral to be made directly to the Bank, and the Bank shall
hold such payments as Collateral Proceeds or shall apply such payments as
provided in Section 6 hereof. If the Company receives any payment on or with
respect to any Collateral after the occurrence of an Event of Default, the
Company shall hold such payment in trust for the benefit of the Bank and shall
promptly remit such payment to the Bank. Upon waiver of an Event of Default, the
Bank shall, within three Banking Days after any such cure or waiver, pay over to
the Company any and all payments on the Collateral collected and held by the
Bank (other than any such payment theretofore applied by the Bank as provided in
Section 6 hereof) and so long as no other Event of Default has occurred, the
Company shall thereafter be entitled to receive directly payments on or with
respect to the Collateral.

           3.4. Stock Dividends; Distributions. Notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 3.3 hereof, the following items shall forthwith be delivered to the
Bank, accompanied by proper stock 


                                      -4-
<PAGE>   76

powers, bond powers and/or instruments of assignment duly executed by the
Company, to be held as Collateral subject to the terms of this Agreement:

                 3.4.1. Any and all dividends and interest on or with respect to
the Collateral paid or payable by delivery of stock or otherwise paid or payable
other than in cash;

                 3.4.2. Any and all other distributions made or payable on or
with respect to the Collateral, whether resulting from a subdivision,
combination or reclassification of the securities of the issuer thereof or
received in exchange for Collateral, or any part thereof, or as a result of any
merger, consolidation, acquisition or other exchange of assets to which such
issuer may be a party or otherwise; and

                 3.4.3. Any and all property (other than dividends and interest)
received in payment of or in redemption of or in exchange for any Collateral.

All such items received by the Company shall be held by it in trust for the
benefit of the Bank until delivered to the Bank.

     Section 4.  Representations and Warranties.  The Company hereby represents 
and warrants to the Bank that:

           4.1. Title to Collateral. The Company is, or on the date of delivery
of the Collateral will be, the sole owner, of record and beneficially, of the
Initial Collateral and all other Eligible Collateral delivered pursuant hereto.
The Company has, or will have at the date of such delivery, good and marketable
title to each item constituting Collateral, free of any mortgage, pledge,
security interest, lien, charge or encumbrance (other than the Lien of this
Agreement). No Person has, or will have at the date of such delivery, any rights
to purchase or acquire any of the Collateral. Exhibit A correctly sets forth the
percentage of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the applicable issuer
eligible to vote for election of directors which each item of Initial Collateral
represents.

           4.2. Perfection of Lien. The Company has taken with respect to the
Initial Collateral, or will have taken at the date of delivery of all of the
Eligible Collateral delivered pursuant hereto, all actions necessary so that the
Bank shall have a valid first and prior perfected security interest in and to,
and a general first lien upon, such Collateral subject to no other lien or
encumbrance.

           4.3. Consents or Governmental Approvals.  No consents or approvals 
of any Person are required for the assignment and transfer by the Company of
possession of any of the Collateral to the Bank hereunder or, except as set
forth herein, the subsequent sale or transfer of such Collateral by the Bank.

           4.4. Status of Collateral. Each share of the Initial Collateral is,
and each share of Eligible Collateral delivered pursuant hereto will be, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable and, to the best of the Company's
knowledge and belief, transferable on the books and records of 


                                      -5-
<PAGE>   77

the issuer in its present form without restriction, except as transferability
may now or in the future be restricted by operation of state "blue sky" laws or
federal securities laws.

     Section 5.  Covenants.

           5.1. Warranty of Title and Authority to Pledge. The Company warrants
and agrees that all the Collateral now or hereafter subject to the Lien of this
Agreement is or will be, as the case may be, owned by the Company, of record and
beneficially, and pledged by it hereunder free and clear of any mortgage,
pledge, security interest, lien, charge or encumbrance, except the Lien of this
Agreement, and that it has and will have full power and lawful authority to
pledge, assign, transfer and deliver such Collateral in the manner and form
described or to cause such Collateral to be so pledged, assigned, transferred
and delivered. The Company shall not create, incur or suffer to exist any
mortgage, pledge, security interest, lien, charge or encumbrance upon the
Collateral other than the Lien of this Agreement. The Company hereby does, and
until the Collateral is reassigned to the Company will, warrant and defend the
title of the Bank to the Collateral, whether now or hereafter pledged or
delivered by the Company, against the claims and demands of all Persons.

           5.2.  Protection of Title; Payment of Taxes, Liens and Other Items.  
The Company shall:

                 5.2.1. Duly and promptly pay and discharge, or cause to be paid
and discharged, before they become delinquent, all taxes, assessments,
governmental and other charges lawfully levied, assessed or imposed upon or
against any of the Collateral, including the income or profits therefrom and the
interest of the Bank in such Collateral;

                 5.2.2. Duly observe and conform in all material respects to all
valid requirements of any governmental authority imposed upon the Company
relative to any of the Collateral, and all covenants, terms and conditions under
or upon which any part thereof is held; and

                 5.2.3. Cause to be paid and discharged all lawful claims
(including, without limitation, income taxes) which, if unpaid, might become a
lien or encumbrance upon the Collateral.

           5.3. Preservation and Protection of Security Interests. The Company
shall faithfully preserve and protect the Bank's security interest in the
Collateral and shall, at its own cost and expense, cause such security interest
to be perfected and continue perfected so long as the Obligations or any portion
thereof are outstanding and unpaid, and for such purpose the Company shall from
time to time at the request of the Bank file or record, or cause to be filed or
recorded, such instruments, documents and notices, including without limitation
financing and continuation statements, as the Bank may deem necessary or
advisable from time to time in order to preserve, perfect and continue perfected
said security interest. The Company shall do all such other acts and things and
shall execute and deliver all such other instruments and documents, including
without limitation further security agreements, pledges, endorsements,
assignments and notices, as 


                                      -6-
<PAGE>   78

the Bank may deem necessary or advisable from time to time in order to perfect
and preserve the priority of said security interest as a perfected first lien in
the Collateral prior to the rights of any other secured party or lien creditor.
The Bank, and its officers, employees and authorized agents, or any of them, are
hereby irrevocably appointed the attorneys-in-fact of the Company to do all acts
and things which the Bank may deem necessary or advisable to preserve, perfect
and continue perfected the Bank's security interest in the Collateral, including
without limitation the signing of financing, continuation or other similar
statements and notices on behalf of the Company.

           5.4. Advances by Bank. If the Company shall fail to perform any of
its covenants contained in this Agreement, the Bank may, but shall not be
obligated to, make advances to perform the same on behalf of the Company, and
the Company will repay upon demand all sums so advanced, with interest from the
date of such advance until payment in full at the default rate of interest
payable under the Loan Documents. All sums so advanced, with interest as
aforesaid, shall be secured by this Agreement. No such advance shall be deemed
to relieve the Company from any Default or Event of Default hereunder.

           5.5. Notice of Default.  If any Default occurs, the Company shall 
give immediate notice of such happening to the Bank.

     Section 6.  Application of Monies.

           6.1. Payments.  Except as otherwise provided herein, all monies which
the Bank shall receive upon realization of the Lien of this Agreement hereunder
or otherwise may be applied by or at the direction of the Bank as follows:

                 6.l.1. First, to the payment or reimbursement of all reasonable
advances, expenses and disbursements of the Bank (including, without limitation,
the fees and disbursements of its counsel and agents) incurred in connection
with the administration and enforcement of, or the preservation of any rights
under, this Agreement or the Loan Documents or in the collection of the
Obligations.

                 6.1.2. Second, to the payment of the then existing Senior
Obligations, matured and unmatured, in such order and in such manner as the Bank
may elect.

                 6.1.3. Third, to the payment of the then existing Junior
Obligations, matured and unmatured, in such order and in such manner as the Bank
may elect.

                 6.1.4. Fourth, after discharge and repayment of all of the 
Obligations, any remaining funds shall be paid by the Bank to the Company.

           6.2. Reserved Rights. The Bank shall have the continuing and
exclusive right to apply or reverse and re-apply any and all payments to any
portion of the Obligations. To the extent that the Company makes a payment or
payments to the Bank or the Bank receives any payment or proceeds of the
Collateral for the Company's benefit, which payment(s) or proceeds or any part
thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set 

                                      -7-
<PAGE>   79

aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party
under any bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause,
then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the Obligations or the
part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue in full
force and effect as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the
Bank.

     Section 7.  Remedies upon Event of Default.

           7.1.  Remedies.

                 7.1.1. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Bank
shall have the right, upon notice to the Company (except that upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 8(h) or 7(i) of the Loan
Agreement, no notice shall be required), to declare the Obligations immediately
due and payable and may, without demand of performance or other demand,
advertisement or notice of any kind to or upon the Company or any other Person
(all and each of which demands, advertisements and/or notices are hereby
expressly waived), forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the
Collateral, or any part thereof, and/or forthwith sell, assign, give an option
or options to purchase, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of and deliver
said Collateral, or any part thereof, in one or more parcels at public or
private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker's board or any of the Bank's
offices or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may deem advisable and
at such prices as it may deem best, for cash or on credit or for future delivery
without assumption of any credit risk, with the right to the Bank upon any such
sale or sales, public or private, to purchase the whole or any part of said
Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in the Company,
which right or equity is (to the extent permitted by applicable law) hereby
expressly waived and released. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the
Company waives all claims, damages and demands against the Bank arising out of
the retention or sale of the Collateral. In addition to the rights and remedies
granted to it in this Agreement and in any other instrument or agreement
securing, evidencing or relating to any of the Obligations, the Bank shall have
all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC.

                 7.1.2. The Company recognizes that, by reason of certain
prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable
state securities laws, the Bank may be compelled, with respect to any sale of
all or any part of the Collateral, to limit purchasers to those who will agree,
among other things, to acquire the Collateral for their own account, for
investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. The
Company acknowledges that any such private sale may be at prices and on terms
less favorable to the Bank than those obtainable through a public sale without
such restrictions, and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such
private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable
manner and that the Bank shall have no obligation to engage in public sales and
no obligation to delay the sale of any Collateral for the period of time
necessary to permit the respective issuer thereof to register it for public
sale.

                                      -8-
<PAGE>   80

                 7.1.3. The Company shall promptly pay or reimburse all costs
and expenses of the Bank, including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees,
incurred with respect to the enforcement or preservation of any of the Bank's
rights hereunder.

                 7.1.4. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
Company hereby waives presentment, demand, protest or any notice (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) of any kind in connection with this Agreement or
any Collateral.

                 7.1.5. The Bank shall not incur any liability as a result of
the sale of any Collateral, or any part thereof, at any private sale conducted
in a commercially reasonable manner, in compliance with any applicable law. The
Company hereby waives any claims against the Bank arising by reason of the fact
that the price at which any of the Collateral may have been sold at such a
private sale was less than the price which might have been obtained at a public
sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the Obligations, even if the Bank
accepts the first offer received and does not offer any Collateral to more than
one offeree, provided that the Bank has acted in a commercially reasonable
manner in conducting such private sale.

                 7.1.6. Upon any sale of all or any part of any Collateral made
either under the power of sale given hereunder or under judgment or decree in
any judicial proceedings for foreclosure or otherwise for the enforcement of
this Agreement, the Bank is hereby irrevocably appointed the true and lawful
attorney of the Company, in its name and stead, to make all necessary deeds,
bills of sale and instruments of assignment, and transfer or conveyance of the
property thus sold. For that purpose, the Bank may execute all such documents
and instruments. This power of attorney shall be deemed coupled with an
interest, and the Company hereby ratifies and confirms all that its said
attorney, or its substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do by virtue of this
Agreement. If so requested by the Bank or by any purchaser of the Collateral or
a portion thereof, the Company shall further ratify and confirm any such sale or
transfer by executing and delivering to the Bank or to such purchaser or
purchasers at the Company's expense all reasonable and proper deeds, bills of
sale, instruments of assignment, conveyance or transfer and releases as may be
designated in any such request.

                 7.1.7. When authorized in accordance with this Section 7.1, the
Bank may proceed to realize upon the security interest in the Collateral against
any one or more of the types of Collateral, at any one time or from time to
time, as the Bank shall determine in its sole discretion, subject to the
provisions of this Section 7.1. The Bank shall not be required to realize upon
any one type of Collateral before proceeding to realize upon the security
interest granted in any other type of Collateral. The proceeds of any sale of,
or other realization upon, or other receipt from, all or any Collateral shall be
applied by the Bank in the manner set forth in Section 6 hereof.

           7.2. Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission Not a Waiver. To the
extent permitted by law and not otherwise provided to the contrary under this
Agreement, no remedy given hereunder to the Bank shall be exclusive of any other
remedy, and every such remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other
remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter given by statute, law, equity or
otherwise to the extent not contrary to or inconsistent with the terms of this

                                      -9-
<PAGE>   81

Agreement. The Bank may, in its absolute discretion, exercise all or any of the
powers, rights or remedies given to it hereunder or which may be now or
hereafter given by statute, law or equity or otherwise. No course of dealing
between the Company and the Bank or any delay or omission of the Bank to
exercise any right, remedy or power accruing upon any Default or Event of
Default shall impair any right, remedy or power or shall be construed to be a
waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or of any right of the Bank or
acquiescence therein, and every right, remedy and power given by this Agreement
to the Bank may, to the extent permitted by law, be exercised from time to time
and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Bank.

     Section 8. Termination of Agreement. Upon the last to occur of (a)
satisfaction of all obligations of the Company under this Agreement, and (b)
payment of all of the Obligations, (c) termination of the Commitment, (d)
termination of all outstanding Letters of Credit or (e) payment in full of the
Notes, this Agreement and the estate and rights hereby granted by the Company in
the Collateral shall automatically cease, terminate and be void simultaneously
therewith. Any of the Collateral remaining at the time of such termination shall
be fully released and discharged from the Lien hereof and delivered to the
Company by the Bank, and this Agreement shall thereupon be released by the Bank,
all at the expense of the Company.

     Section 9. Miscellaneous.

           9.1. Expenses. All fees, costs or expenses, including reasonable fees
and expenses of outside legal counsel, incurred by the Bank or any participating
Persons, as such Persons are contemplated by Section 9 of the Loan Agreement, in
connection with either the preparation, administration, amendment, modification
or enforcement of this Agreement or any other instruments, documents, or
agreements to be delivered pursuant thereto (including, without limitation, (a)
all expenses incurred in obtaining all necessary judicial and other approvals of
the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) all expenses incurred in conducting
any examinations or appraisals which the Bank, in its sole discretion, deems
necessary or appropriate, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 6.3 of
the Loan Agreement restricting the Company's obligations with respect to
inventory audits, or (c) out-of-pocket collateral administration expenses) shall
be paid by the Company on demand.

           9.2. Term of Agreement; Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and
all covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made herein and in the
certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the execution and delivery
hereof and shall continue in full force and effect until the termination of this
Agreement as set forth in Section 8. Whenever in this Agreement any of the
parties hereto are referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the
permitted successors and assigns of such party; and all terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. The
Company may not assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
consent of the Bank. The Bank may assign all or any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior consent of the Company.

           9.3. Notices. Notices, demands and communications shall be deemed to
have been properly given to the Company only when faxed to the Company at (614)
548-6541 or when 

                                      -10-

           9.4. No Implied Waivers. No delay on the part of the Bank in
exercising any right, power or privilege granted hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right,
power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof. The rights
and remedies herein expressly specified are cumulative and not exclusive of any
other rights and remedies which the Bank would otherwise have.

           9.5. Amendments, Modifications, Etc. No amendment, modification,
termination, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement nor consent to any
departure by the Company therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be in writing and signed by the Bank, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose
for which given. No notice or demand on the Company in any case shall entitle
the Company to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.

           9.6. Applicable Law.  This Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract
made under the laws of the State of Ohio, and for all purposes shall be
construed in accordance with the laws of such state.

           9.7. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or
enforceability of such provisions in any other jurisdiction.

           9.8. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be signed in any number of 
counterparts with the same effect as if the signatures thereto were upon the
same instrument. Complete sets of counterparts shall be lodged with the Company

understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersede
all prior agreements or understandings with respect thereto in their entirety.

           9.10. Headings.  Headings of the sections of this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement.

           9.11. Effective Date.  This Agreement shall become effective upon the

           9.12. Confession of Judgment. The Company hereby authorizes any
attorney at law to appear for the Company, in an action on this Agreement, at
any time after any obligation hereunder becomes due, as herein provided, in any
court of record in or of the State of Ohio, or elsewhere, to waive the issuing
and service of process against the Company and to confess judgment in favor of
the Bank or the party entitled to the benefits of this Agreement against the

specifically agree that any action, suit or proceeding in respect of or arising
from or out of this Agreement, its validity or performance, shall be initiated

with the Bank's exercise of its rights under Section 9.12 hereof. The parties
hereto consent to and submit to the exercise of jurisdiction over their person
by any court situated at Columbus, Ohio, including without limitation the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio and having jurisdiction

designates CT Corporation System, its current agent for service of process in

its statutory agent for service of process in the State of Ohio during the term
of this Agreement.

            9.14. Waiver of Jury Trial. THE BANK AND THE COMPANY HEREBY
VOLUNTARILY, IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY

enforced by the Bank without first resorting to or exhausting any other remedy
available under the Agreement, any other guaranty of the Agreement, any other
related agreement, document or instrument pursuant to which the Company or any
other Person is obligated to the Bank, or otherwise; provided, however, that

               3.3.  WAIVER OF NOTICE, EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE AGREEMENT,

extent hereinafter set forth in this Section 3.4.  If, prior to the payment and
performance of all of the Obligations, upon the occurrence and during the
continuation of a Default or an Event of Default under the Agreement, Guarantor
would, without reference to the provisions of this Section 3.4, be entitled to
receive any payment on account of any claim of Guarantor against the Company,
in insolvency proceedings or otherwise, all such payments shall be made instead
to the Bank until all of the Obligations have been paid and performed in full,
and Guarantor hereby so directs.  If, following the occurrence and during the

payment on account of any claim of Guarantor against the Company, Guarantor

and performance of all of the Obligations.

counterclaim, reduction, or diminution of any obligation, or any other defense
of any kind or nature (excepting payment or performance in fact) which
Guarantor has or may have against the Bank shall limit or in any way affect
Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty.

               3.6.  WAIVER OF RIGHTS TO SUBROGATION AND REIMBURSEMENT.
Guarantor hereby waives any right of subrogation to the rights of the Bank
against the Company, any right of reimbursement by the Company or any other
right of recovery that Guarantor may have against the Company if Guarantor
makes any payment under this Guaranty.  Guarantor hereby represents and
warrants that it has not received any promissory note from the Company or
entered into any other written or oral agreement with the Company to the effect
that Guarantor will be reimbursed


                                      -4-
<PAGE>   91
by the Company if Guarantor makes any payments under this Guaranty and has not
received any property of the Company as security for any such reimbursement.
Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that Guarantor will not, at any time,
accept any promissory note or enter into any written or oral agreement with the
Company which has the effect of reimbursing Guarantor for any payments that it
may make under this Guaranty, accept any property of the Company as security
for any such reimbursement, or make any claim for reimbursement or that
Guarantor should be subrogated to the rights of the Bank against the Company.
The waivers, representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this paragraph are for the benefit of and may be enforced by the Bank and the
Company and their respective successors and assigns, including (without
limitation) any trustee in bankruptcy of the Company.

               3.7.  WAIVER OF NOTICE OF ACCEPTANCE.  Guarantor hereby
expressly waives notice from the Bank of its acceptance of and reliance upon

contracted or incurred in reliance upon this Guaranty.

               3.8.  SECURITY.  The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are

Guarantor shall not, without the prior written consent of the Bank:

                 (a)  Create, incur, assume or permit to continue any Lien on
any of its property or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, except
Permitted Liens; nor

               (b)  Create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Indebtedness

performance of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, the
Company agrees that the Bank shall have, and there is hereby granted to and
created in favor of the Bank, a Lien under the UCC, and otherwise in accordance
with applicable law, in and to the Collateral.  The Lien created hereunder
shall be prior in interest to any other Lien affecting the Collateral.  The

satisfied and the Borrower shall no longer have any right to request any Loans
under the Loan Agreement.  Notwithstanding any thing contained in this Section

of any Lien in favor of the Bank against Accounts, Equipment and Inventory is
not provided to the


                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>   99
Bank by the substitution therefor of a Lien against real estate or any other
asset which is not as quickly convertible into cash as Accounts, Equipment or
Inventory.

       Section 3.  Representations and Warranties.  The Company hereby
represents and warrants to the Bank that:

               3.1.  Title to Collateral.  The Company has good, indefeasible
and marketable title to all the Collateral free of all Liens other than those
granted hereby, except for Liens of landlords under state statutes or Liens
permitted under the Loan Agreement.  No financing or continuation statement
which names the Company as debtor has been filed in any state or other
jurisdiction except as provided for herein or as set forth on Schedule 3.1
hereto, and the Company has not agreed or consented to cause or to permit in
the future (upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of the
Collateral, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien.

               3.2.  Perfection of Lien.  The Company has taken or caused to be
taken all actions necessary to establish the Bank's Lien in the Collateral as a
valid, enforceable and perfected Lien, first and prior to all other Liens
except Liens permitted under the Loan Agreement.

               3.3.  Books and Records; Chief Executive Office.  All books and
records of the Company concerning the Collateral are accurate, complete and
maintained in accordance with GAAP.  The Collateral Locations Exhibit correctly
sets forth the address of (a) the chief executive office, registered office and
principal place of business of the Company, (b) any plant or division of the
Company maintaining a separate principal place of business, registered office
or chief executive office, (c) all other places of business of the Company and
the location of all Collateral and (d) the name and business address of each
landlord and mortgagee with any interest in any Collateral Location.  The only
original books of account and records of the Company relating to any Accounts
of the Company are, and will continue to be, kept at the offices of the Company
set forth on the Collateral Locations Exhibit opposite the name of the division
or the plant of the Company where such Accounts originated.  The only locations
at which Equipment  and Inventory are located are set forth on the Collateral
Locations Exhibit opposite the name of the division or the plant of the Company
or other location where such Equipment  and Inventory are located.

               3.4.  Accounts.  The Accounts arose out of bona fide sales or
services, are collectible in the ordinary course of business and are not
disputed or subject to offset.

       Section 4.  Affirmative Covenants.  On and after the date of this
Agreement and until all of the Obligations shall have been paid and discharged
in full or otherwise satisfied and the Company shall no longer have any right
to request any Loans under the Loan Agreement:

               4.1.  Insurance.  The Company shall at all times:  (a) maintain
or cause to be maintained insurance upon the Collateral with responsible and
reputable insurers of such character and in such amounts as are usually
maintained by Persons engaged in a like business; (b) furnish to the Bank,
prior to the execution of this Agreement and annually thereafter certificates
of


                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>   100
insurance with respect to all insurance policies required to be maintained
hereunder, in form and detail satisfactory to the Bank; (c) require each policy
of insurance to contain a provision whereby it cannot be canceled, amended or
modified except after 30 days' prior written notice to the Bank; (d) require
each policy of insurance covering any of the Collateral to be written or
endorsed so as to make losses, if any, payable to the Bank, in addition to the
Company; and (e) require each policy of insurance covering any of the
Collateral to contain an agreement by the insurer that any loss shall be
payable to the Bank notwithstanding any act or negligence of the Company which
might otherwise result in forfeiture of said insurance.  If the Company fails
to pay or cause to be paid the premium on any such insurance, the Bank may, in
its sole discretion, do so for the account of the Company, add the cost thereof
to the Obligations and be reimbursed by the Company therefor on demand.

               4.2.  Notice of Default.  If any Default or Event of Default
occurs, the Company shall give prompt notice of such happening to the Bank.

               4.3.  Inspection.  The Company shall permit any Person
designated by the Bank to enter, examine, audit and inspect the Collateral and
all properties, corporate books and financial records pertaining to the
Collateral, or the operation, business, affairs and financial condition of the
Company at any reasonable time and from time to time, and shall permit such
Persons to copy and make excerpts of such books and records.

               4.4.  Sale of Inventory.  Notwithstanding the security interest
in the Collateral granted hereunder, the Company shall have the right to sell,
lease or otherwise dispose of its Inventory in the ordinary course of its
business, free and clear of such security interest; but, in such event, such
security interest shall continue in the proceeds of such sale, lease or other
disposition.

               4.5.  Company's Rights to Collect Accounts.  Notwithstanding the
security interest in the Accounts granted under this Agreement, the Company
shall endeavor to collect the Accounts at its own cost and expense, until such
time as the Bank shall have notified the Company, pursuant to Section 4.6, that
the Bank has revoked the Company's right to collect the Accounts.

               4.6.  Collection of Accounts by the Bank.  If an Event of
Default shall have occurred, the Bank shall have the right at any time and
without affecting the liability of the Company to the Bank (a) to revoke any
right of the Company to collect its Accounts, pursuant to Section 4.5, by
written notice to the Company to such effect, (b) to take over and direct
collection of the Accounts of the Company, (c) to give notice of the security
interest of the Bank in the Accounts to any or all of the Customers, (d) to
give notice to the Customers to make payment of the Accounts directly to the
Bank (and, at the request of the Bank, the Company shall indicate on all
billings to Customers that payments thereon are to be made to the Bank), and
(e) to take control of the Accounts of the Company and the Proceeds thereof,
and to take possession of all of the Company's books and records relating
thereto, with full power and authority in the name of the Bank or of the
Company to enforce, collect, sue for, receive, compromise, settle and give
receipts for any and all of the Accounts.  If any Account becomes evidenced by
a promissory


                                     - 5 -
<PAGE>   101
note, trade acceptance, chattel paper or other writing or instrument for the
payment of money, and there is at the time a Default, the Company shall, at the
request of the Bank, promptly deliver any such instrument to the Bank duly
endorsed to the order of the Bank as additional Collateral under this
Agreement.  It is understood and agreed by the Company that the Bank shall have
no liability whatsoever to the Company under this Section 4.6.

               4.7.  Account Verification.  The Bank may at any time, without
notice to the Company, verify with any Customer the status of any Account
payable by such Customer; provided, however, that, prior to the occurrence of
an Event of Default, no request for verification shall be made in the name of
the Bank, nor shall the Bank disclose the purpose of such request.  The Company
from time to time will execute and deliver such instruments and take all such
action as the Bank may reasonably request in order to effectuate the purpose of
this Section 4.7.

               4.8.  Preservation and Protection of Security Interests.  The
Company shall faithfully preserve and protect the Bank's security interest in
the Collateral and shall, at its own cost and expense, cause such security
interest to be perfected and continue perfected so long as the Obligations or
any portion thereof are outstanding and unpaid, and for such purpose the
Company shall from time to time at the request of the Bank file or record, or
cause to be filed or recorded, such instruments, documents and notices,
including without limitation financing and continuation statements, as the Bank
may deem necessary or advisable from time to time in order to preserve, perfect
and continue perfected said security interest.  The Company shall do all such
other acts and things and shall execute and deliver all such other instruments
and documents, including without limitation further security agreements,
pledges, endorsements, assignments and notices, as the Bank may deem necessary
or advisable from time to time in order to perfect and preserve the priority of
said security interest as a perfected first Lien in the Collateral prior to the
rights of any other secured party or lien creditor.  The Bank, and its
officers, employees and authorized agents, or any of them, are hereby
irrevocably appointed the attorneys-in-fact of the Company to do all acts and
things which the Bank may deem necessary or advisable to preserve, perfect and
continue perfected the Bank's security interest in the Collateral, including
without limitation the signing of financing, continuation or other similar
statements and notices on behalf of the Company.

               4.9.  Maintenance of Collateral.  The Company shall (a) from
time to time replace and repair all parts of the Collateral which are or become
worn, broken, damaged, or deteriorated, maintain the Collateral now or
hereafter owned or acquired by it, and every part thereof, in good working
order and repair and pay the costs of such repairs, replacements, and
maintenance as well as any costs of storing the same; and (b) pay and discharge
all taxes, assessments, fees, and other governmental charges or levies imposed
upon it or any of the Collateral as well as all lawful claims of materialmen,
mechanics, carriers, warehousemen, landlords and other similar Persons for
labor, materials, supplies and rentals which, if unpaid, might by law become a
Lien on the Collateral or any part thereof.  If the Company fails to make any
payments it is required to make under this Section 4.9, the Bank may do so for
the account of the Company and may add the amount of such payments to the
Obligations.


                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>   102
               4.10.  Inventory.  The Company shall maintain the Inventory in
good condition, salable at the Company's normal prices in the ordinary course
of its business.

               4.11.  New Stores.  Prior to the opening of any retail store not
presently operated by the Company, the Company shall give written notice to the
Bank and shall perform such acts as may be necessary or advisable to grant to
the Bank a perfected Lien, subject to no other Liens other than Liens permitted
under the Loan Agreement, in the Collateral located or to be located in such
new retail store.

               4.12.  Annual Certificate.  The Company shall furnish to the
Bank within 45 days after the close of each fiscal year, a certificate of the
chief financial officer or controller of the Company certifying that he has
reviewed the locations where the Equipment and Inventory are located and that
appropriate filings have been made for the Company and each Subsidiary so that
the Bank continues to have a perfected Lien hereunder, subject to no other Lien
other than Liens permitted under the Loan Agreement.

               4.13.  Removal of the Equipment.

                        4.13.1.  If no Event of Default shall have occurred, in
any instance where the Company in its discretion determines that any items of
the Equipment have become inadequate, obsolete, worn out, unsuitable,
undesirable or unnecessary, Company may remove such items of the Equipment from
any Collateral Location and sell, trade-in, exchange or otherwise dispose of
them (as a whole or in part) without any responsibility or accountability to
Bank, provided, however that Company shall either:

                                (a)  Substitute and install anywhere on such
Collateral Location other machinery, furnishing, equipment or related property
having equal or greater value (but not necessarily having the same function) in
the operation of its business for the purpose for which it is intended;
provided, further, however such removal and substitution shall not be out of
the ordinary course of business, all of which substituted machinery,
furnishings, Equipment or related property shall be free of all liens (other
than Permitted Liens) and shall become a part of the Collateral; or

                                (b)  Not make any such substitution and
installation; provided, further, however that in the case of (i) the sale of
any such Equipment to anyone other than itself or the scrapping thereof, or
(ii) the trade-in of such Equipment for other machinery on such Collateral
Location, Company shall use the proceeds of such sale for the reduction of the
Obligations.

                        4.13.2.  Company shall promptly report to Bank each
removal, substitution, sale or other disposition of Equipment described in
Section 4.13.1 above and shall pay to Bank such amounts as are required by the
provisions of Section 4.13.1 (b) promptly after the sale, trade-in or other
disposition requiring such payment. Company shall not remove, or permit the
removal of, any of the Equipment from any Collateral Location except in

name change.  The Company shall not hold its right, title or interest in, nor

       Section 6.  Application of Moneys.

               6.1.  Payments.  Except as otherwise provided herein, all monies
which the Bank shall receive either upon realization of the Lien granted
hereunder or otherwise may be applied by or at the direction of the Bank as
follows:

                        6.l.1.  First, to the payment or reimbursement of all
reasonable advances, expenses and disbursements of the Bank (including, without

connection with the administration and enforcement of, or the preservation of
any rights under, this Agreement or the Loan Documents or in the collection of

               6.2.  Reserved Rights.  The Bank shall have the continuing and
exclusive right to apply or reverse and re-apply any and all payments to any
portion of the Obligations.  To the extent that the Borrower makes a payment or
payments to the Bank or the Bank receives any payment or proceeds of the
Collateral for the Borrower's benefit, which payment(s) or proceeds or any part
thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party under any bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law or
equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the
Obligations or the part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and
continue in full force and effect as if such payment or proceeds had not been
received by the Bank.

       Section 7.  Events of Default and Remedies.

Agreement, no notice shall be required) to declare the Obligations immediately
due and payable and may, without demand of performance or other demand,
advertisement or notice of any kind to or upon the Company or any other Person
(all and each of which demands, advertisements and/or notices are hereby
expressly waived), forthwith exercise such rights and remedies as are provided
by the UCC and such other rights and remedies in respect thereof as it may have
at law or in equity or under any of the Loan Documents, including without
limitation the right to enter any premises where any of the Collateral is
located and take

possession of the same without demand or notice and without prior judicial
hearing or legal proceedings, which the Company hereby expressly waives, and to
sell all or any portion of the Collateral at public or private sale, without
prior notice to the Company except as otherwise required by law (and, if notice
is required by law, after 10 days prior written notice), at such place or
places and at such time or times and in such manner and upon such terms,
whether for cash or on credit, as the Bank in its sole discretion may
determine.  Upon any such sale of any of the Collateral, the Bank may purchase
all or any of the Collateral being sold, free from any equity or right of
redemption.  The Bank shall apply the proceeds of any such sale as provided in
Section 6.  If such proceeds are insufficient to pay the amounts required by
law, the Company shall be liable for any deficiency in the amount so realized
from the Collateral.

                        7.1.2.  The Company shall promptly pay or reimburse all
costs and expenses of the Bank and any participating Persons, as such Persons
are contemplated by Section 9 of the Loan Agreement, including, but not limited
to, attorneys' fees, incurred with respect to the enforcement or preservation
of any of the Bank's rights hereunder.

                        7.1.3.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
the Company hereby waives presentment, demand, protest or any notice (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) of any kind in connection with this
Agreement or any Collateral.

                        7.1.4.  The Bank shall not incur any liability as a
result of the sale of any Collateral, or any part thereof, at any private sale
conducted in a commercially reasonable manner, in compliance with any
applicable law.  The Company hereby waives any claims against the Bank arising
by reason of the fact that the price at which any of the Collateral may have
been sold at such a private sale was less than the price which might have been
obtained at a public sale or was less than the aggregate amount of the
Obligations, even if the Bank accepts the first offer received and does not
offer any Collateral to more than one offeree, provided that the Bank has acted
in a commercially reasonable manner in conducting such private sale.

                        7.1.5.  Upon any sale of all or any part of any
Collateral made either under the power of sale given hereunder or under
judgment or decree in any judicial proceedings for foreclosure or otherwise for
the enforcement of this Agreement, the Bank is hereby irrevocably appointed the
true and lawful attorney of the Company, in its name and stead, to make all
necessary deeds, bills of sale and instruments of assignment, and transfer or
conveyance of the property thus sold.  For that purpose, the Bank may execute
all such documents and instruments.  This power of attorney shall be deemed
coupled with an interest, and the Company hereby ratifies and confirms all that
its said attorney, or its substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do by
virtue of this Agreement.  If so requested by the Bank or by any purchaser of
the Collateral or a portion thereof, the Company shall further ratify and
confirm any such sale or transfer by executing and delivering to the Bank or to
such purchaser or purchasers at the Company's expense all reasonable and proper
deeds, bills of sale, instruments of assignment, conveyance or transfer and
releases as may be designated in any such request.

                        7.1.6.  When authorized in accordance with this Section
7.1, the Bank may proceed to realize upon the security interest in the
Collateral against any one or more of the types


                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>   106
of Collateral, at any one time or from time to time, as the Bank shall
determine in its sole discretion, subject to the provisions of this Section
7.1.  The Bank shall not be required to realize upon any one type of Collateral
before proceeding to realize upon the security interest granted in any other
type of Collateral.  The proceeds of any sale of, or other realization upon, or
other receipt from, all or any Collateral shall be applied by the Bank in the
manner set forth in Section 6 hereof.

               7.2.  Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission Not a Waiver.  To
the extent permitted by law and not otherwise provided to the contrary under
this Agreement, no remedy given hereunder to the Bank shall be exclusive of any
other remedy, and every such remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to
every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter given by statute, law,
equity or otherwise to the extent not contrary to or inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement.  The Bank may, in its absolute discretion, exercise
all or any of the powers, rights or remedies given to it hereunder or which may
be now or hereafter given by statute, law or equity or otherwise.  No course of
dealing between the Company and the Bank or any delay or omission of the Bank
to exercise any right, remedy or power accruing upon any Default or Event of
Default shall impair any right, remedy or power or shall be construed to be a
waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or of any right of the Bank or
acquiescence therein, and every right, remedy and power given by this Agreement
to the Bank may, to the extent permitted by law, be exercised from time to time
and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Bank.

               7.3.  Assembling of Collateral.  Upon the occurrence of any
Default, the Company, upon demand by the Bank, shall promptly assemble the
Collateral, or any part thereof designated by the Bank, and make it available
to the Bank at a place to be designated by the Bank which shall be reasonably
convenient to the Bank and the Company.  The right of the Bank under this
Section 7.3 to have the Collateral assembled and made available to it is of the
essence of this Agreement and the Bank may, at its election, enforce such right
by an action for specific performance.

               7.4.  No Requirement to Marshal Collateral.  The Company, to the
extent that it has any right, title or interest in any of the Collateral,
waives and releases any right to require the Bank to collect any of the
Obligations from any portion of the Collateral under any theory of marshaling
of assets, or otherwise, and specifically authorizes the Bank to apply any of
its Collateral against any of the Obligations in any manner that the Bank may
determine.

       Section 8.  Termination of Agreement.  Upon the last to occur of (a)
satisfaction of all obligations of the Company under this Agreement, (b)
payment of all of the Obligations, (c) termination of the Commitment, (d)
termination of all outstanding Letters of Credit or (e) payment in full of the
Notes, this Agreement and the estate and rights hereby granted by the Company
in the Collateral shall automatically cease, terminate and be void
simultaneously therewith.  Any of the Collateral remaining at the time of such
termination shall be fully released and discharged from the Lien hereof and
delivered to the Company by the Bank, and this Agreement shall thereupon be
released by the Bank, all at the expense of the Company.

                             FORM OF BORROWER'S COUNSEL'S OPINION

1.       The Company and each of its Wholly Owned Subsidiaries are corporations
         duly organized, and each other Subsidiary is a corporation duly
         incorporated, and the Company and each Subsidiary is validly existing
         and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdictions in which
         incorporated. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have all
         requisite power and authority, corporate or otherwise, to own or lease
         their property and carry on their businesses as and in the places where
         such properties are now located, leased or operated or such businesses
         are now conducted and the Company has such power and authority to enter
         into and perform all of its obligations under the Agreement, the Notes,
         the Security Agreement, and the Pledge Agreement. Each Wholly Owned
         Subsidiary has all requisite power and authority, corporate or
         otherwise, to enter into and perform all of its obligations under its
         Subsidiary Guaranty and Subsidiary Security Agreement.

2.       The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the
         Agreement, the Notes, the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement
         has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action. The
         Agreement, the Notes, the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement
         have been duly executed and delivered by the Company. The Agreement,
         the Notes, the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement constitute
         the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, and are
         enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, subject
         as to enforceability to bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws
         affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject to
         general principles of equity.

3.       The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Wholly Owned
         Subsidiaries of its Subsidiary Guaranty and Subsidiary Security
         Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action.
         Each of the Subsidiary Guaranties and Subsidiary Security Agreements
         has been duly executed and delivered by the applicable Wholly Owned
         Subsidiary. Each of the Subsidiary Guaranties and Subsidiary Security
         Agreements constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
         applicable Wholly Owned Subsidiary, and is enforceable against such
         Wholly Owned Subsidiary in accordance with its terms, subject as to
         enforceability to bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws
         affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and subject to
         general principles of equity.

4.       Each of the Notes issued and delivered to the Bank pursuant to the
         provisions of the Agreement (assuming its due execution and delivery)
         is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Company in
         accordance with its terms, subject as to enforceability to bankruptcy,
         insolvency or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
         creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of
         equity.

5.       To the best of our knowledge, after due inquiry, neither the Company
         nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of or in default under any
         provision of: its Certificate of 

                                      -1-
<PAGE>   113

         Incorporation or Bylaws (each as amended to date); any law, rule,
         regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or
         award presently in effect and having applicability to the Company or
         any of its Subsidiaries; or any loan, indenture, credit agreement,
         lease or other instrument which violation or default could materially
         adversely affect the business, Consolidated financial position or
         Consolidated results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

6.       To the best of our knowledge, after due inquiry, the execution,
         delivery and performance of the Agreement, the Notes, the Security
         Agreement and the Pledge Agreement by the Company and of the Subsidiary
         Guaranties and Subsidiary Security Agreements by each of the Wholly
         Owned Subsidiaries does not result in a violation of any terms or
         conditions of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company
         or any Wholly Owned Subsidiary, or breach any term or provision of, or
         constitute a default under, any agreement, note or other agreement to
         which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, which
         violation, breach or default could materially adversely affect the
         business, Consolidated financial position or Consolidated results of
         operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

7.       To the best of our knowledge, after due inquiry, there is no action,
         proceeding or investigation pending or threatened which questions the
         validity of the Agreement, the Notes or any of the Loan Documents or
         any action taken or to be taken pursuant thereto, or which might
         result, either in any case or in the aggregate, in any material and
         adverse change in the business, operations, affairs or condition of the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries, their properties and assets or in
         any material liability on the part of the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries.

8.       All amounts due or to become due to the Bank under the Agreement are
         "Senior Indebtedness" as that term is defined in the Indenture. The
         Debentures are subordinated and subject in right to the prior payment
         in full of all amounts due or to become due to the Bank under the
         Agreement to the extent and in the manner set forth in the subsections
         of Article Fourteen of the Indenture.

9.       Each Note is, or, upon issuance, will be, entitled to the benefits of,
         and is secured by valid Liens created by, the Pledge Agreement, the
         Security Agreement, the Subsidiary Guaranties and the Subsidiary
         Security Agreements.

10.      The provisions of the Pledge Agreement, the Security Agreement and the
         Subsidiary Security Agreements are effective to create in favor of the
         Bank legal, valid and enforceable security interests as between the
         parties to those agreements, but specifically excluding any opinion as
         to the perfection of those security interests except as provided in
         paragraph 11 below, in all right, title, and interest of the Company
         and the Wholly Owned Subsidiaries in the Collateral, as defined
         therein, and further subject as to enforceability to bankruptcy,
         insolvency or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
         creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of
         equity.

11.      Assuming (i) the accuracy and completeness of the list of Store
         Locations set forth on attached Exhibit B, and (ii) that, other than
         [**Centerline, Inc. as to the State of Delaware and Drug Emporium, Inc.
         as to the States of South Carolina, Indiana and New Hampshire**], each
         debtor has a place of business in more than one county of each state
         listed opposite its respective name on attached Exhibit C, and based
         solely upon our review of Ohio law and the CCH Secured Transaction
         Guide as to the other jurisdictions, the filing of financing statements
         in substantially the form of Exhibit A, with appropriate names of the
         debtor inserted therein and appropriate exhibits appended thereto (the
         "Financing Statements") with the Secretary of State and County Recorder
         (or other comparable official) of the states and counties listed on
         attached Exhibit C will be sufficient to perfect the Bank's security
         interest described in the Security Agreement and the Subsidiary
         Security Agreements in the Collateral as defined therein, and the
         delivery to the Bank of the Collateral, as defined in the Pledge
         Agreement, is sufficient to perfect the Bank's security interest
         described in the Pledge Agreement, except as follows:

         (a)      in the case of "instruments" [as such term is defined in
                  Uniform Commercial Code Section 9-105 (1)(i) (Ohio Revised
                  Code Section 1309.01(A)(9)] not constituting part of "chattel
                  paper" [as such term is defined in Uniform Commercial Code
                  Section 9-105(1)(b) (Ohio Revised Code Section 1309.01(A)(2)],
                  the security interest of the Bank therein cannot be perfected
                  through the filing of the Financing Statements but will be
                  perfected if possession thereof is obtained by the Bank;

         (b)      insofar as the Bank's security interest relates to
                  after-acquired Collateral, such security interest will be
                  perfected only when the Company or a Subsidiary acquires
                  rights in such Collateral;

         (c)      the effectiveness of the Financing Statements terminates five
                  years after the date of filing, unless a continuation
                  statement is filed prior to such termination in accordance
                  with Uniform Commercial Code Section 9-403(2)-(3) [Ohio
                  Revised Code Section 1309.40(B)-(C)];

         (d)      in the case of nonidentifiable cash proceeds, continuation of
                  perfection of the Bank's security interest therein is limited
                  to the degree set forth in Uniform Commercial Code Section
                  9-306 (Ohio Revised Code Section 1309.25);

         (e)      if the Company or a Subsidiary so changes its name, identity,
                  or corporate structure that any Financing Statement becomes
                  seriously misleading, the filing of such Financing Statement
                  will, pursuant to Uniform Commercial Code Section 9-402(7)
                  [Ohio Revised Code Section 1309.39(G)], be ineffective to
                  perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the
                  Company or any such Subsidiary more than four months after the
                  change, unless a new appropriate financing statement is filed
                  before the expiration of that period;

         (f)      in the case of either (1) the movement of certain tangible
                  collateral to a state in which a Financing Statement has not
                  been filed or (2) a change in the location of

<PAGE>   115

                  the Company or a Subsidiary to a state in which a Financing
                  Statement has not been filed, the Bank's security interest
                  will become unperfected unless a new appropriate financing
                  statement is filed in the new state within four months in
                  accordance with Uniform Commercial Code Section 9-103 (Ohio
                  Revised Code Section 1309.03); and

         (g)      under certain circumstances described in Uniform Commercial
                  Code Sections 9-307 and 9-308 (Ohio Revised Code Sections
                  1309.26 and 1309.27), purchasers of collateral may take the
                  same free of a perfected security interest.

12.      To the best of our knowledge, after due inquiry (such inquiry
         consisting solely of (a) a certificate delivered to us by the Company,
         and (b) our review of the results of searches conducted by, and made
         available to us by, the Bank, as set forth on attached Exhibit D), the
         Bank's perfected security interest in the Collateral described in the
         Security Agreement and the Subsidiary Security Agreements is prior to
         any other security interest in such Collateral evidenced by the filing
         of a financing statement, but only to the extent a security interest in
         such Collateral created by the Security Agreement and the Subsidiary
         Security Agreements may be perfected by the filing of financing
         statement(s), and, assuming that the Bank has no notice of any adverse
         claim in favor of any third person in the Collateral described in the
         Pledge Agreement, the Bank's perfected security interest in the
         Collateral described in the Pledge Agreement is prior to any Liens,
         except for the following:

         (a)      the Bank's security interest is subordinate to the Liens
                  described on Exhibit D attached hereto and made a part hereof;

         (b)      the Bank's security interest is subordinate to Liens expressly
                  permitted under the Agreement or the Pledge Agreement, the
                  Security Agreement or the Subsidiary Security Agreements; and

         (c)      insofar as the Bank's security interest relates to
                  after-acquired Collateral, such security interest may be
                  subordinated in priority to the conflicting security interest
                  of a purchase-money creditor pursuant to Uniform Commercial
                  Code Section 9-312(3)-(4) [Ohio Revised Code Section
                  1309.31(C)-(D)] or to a federal tax lien properly filed more
                  than 45 days before such security interest arises (or a lesser
                  period, if the Bank acquires knowledge of such federal tax
                  lien), pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 6323(c).

                               PENDING LITIGATION

        Nortex Drug Distributors, Inc. v. Drug Emporium, Inc., Case No.
C2-93-767, filed August 6, 1993, and Texas Drug Distributors, Inc. v. Drug
Emporium, Inc., Case No. C2-93-847, filed August 30, 1993, both of which are
pending in the United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, Eastern
Division. The plaintiffs in the two suits are both franchisees of the Company.
The claims set forth in the complaints are substantially the same in both suits
and allege that the Company failed to perform as required under the Company's
franchise agreements with plaintiffs and under Texas law. Plaintiffs also claim
that the Company imposed a mandatory pricing structure on plaintiffs which
violated state and federal antitrust laws. The plaintiffs are seeking treble
damages and a declaration that the noncompetition clause in the franchise
agreements is unenforceable. No specific amount of damages is claimed. The
Company is aggressively defending these suits.

                          LANDLORD'S WAIVER AND CONSENT

      THIS LANDLORD'S WAIVER AND CONSENT is executed as of this ______ day of
__________, 199__, by _________________, located at ________________
("Landlord"), for the benefit of Bank One, Columbus, NA, a national banking
association located at 100 East Broad Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215 (the "Bank").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

      WHEREAS, the Bank has made or is about to make one or more loans,
advances, and/or other financial accommodations to Drug Emporium, Inc. (the
"Borrower"), to be secured in whole or in part by a guaranty ______________ of
(the "Subsidiary"), which guaranty is to be secured in whole or in part by a

      WHEREAS, the Collateral is or may be kept at the premises located at
______________ (the "Premises") which are owned by the Landlord and leased to 
the Subsidiary, pursuant to a lease agreement (the "Lease").

      1. The Landlord consents to the location of the Collateral in the
Premises, and agrees that any right, title or interest in or to the Collateral
it may have or acquire under statute or through any other means by reason of the
location in the Premises of the Collateral, or possession thereof, or otherwise,
is subordinate to the right, title and interest of the Bank in and to the
Collateral to the full extent the Collateral secures or may hereafter secure any
and all obligations and indebtedness of every kind, now existing or hereafter
arising, and the Landlord hereby agrees that, so long as the Borrower is
obligated or indebted to the Bank, the Landlord shall not exercise any rights,
assert any claim or interest, take any action or institute any proceedings with
respect to the Collateral.

      2. The Bank and its agents and representatives may enter the Premises and
remove and take possession of the Collateral at any time in accordance with said
security agreement and the Bank shall have the right to occupy the Premises for

Collateral located on the Premises, will permit the Bank to remove the
Collateral from the Premises without charge and will not hinder the Bank's
actions in enforcing its liens in the Collateral.

hereafter have in and to the Collateral, including, without limitation, any
right to levy upon the Collateral and any right to distraint with respect
thereto under any law now or hereafter in force.

and Consent, the Bank agrees that it will repair any and all damage caused to

such real property improvements to be returned to the same condition they were
in immediately prior to the taking of any such actions by the Bank.

      5. The provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect until the
Borrower has fully paid and performed all of its obligations to the Bank under
all security agreements, present and future, and any extensions, modifications
and renewals thereof at any time made.

               TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF APPLICATION AND AGREEMENT
                        FOR COMMERCIAL LETTER OF CREDIT


        In consideration of your issuing, at our request, your Commercial 
Letter of Credit (herein called "the Credit") substantially in accordance with 
the Application appearing on the first page hereof, the undersigned agree as
follows:

        1.  We certify that each draft or acceptance under or purporting to be 
under the Credit will grow out of transactions pursuant to definite bona fide 
contracts for the shipment of goods within a specified reasonable time.

        2.  As to drafts or acceptance under or purporting to be under the 
Credit, which are payable in United States Currency, we agree (a) in the case 
of each sight draft, to reimburse you at your issuing office, on demand, in 
United States legal tender, the amount paid on such draft, or, if so demanded 
by you, to pay to you at said office, in advance in such legal tender the 
amount required to pay such draft; and (b) in the case of each acceptance, to 
pay to you, at said office, in United States legal tender, the amount thereof, 
on demand but in any event not later than one business day prior to maturity, 
or, in case the acceptance is not payable at your said office, then on demand, 
but in any event in time to reach the place of payment in the usual course of 
the mails not later than one business day prior to maturity.

        3.  As to drafts or acceptances under or purporting to be under the 
Credit, which are payable in currency other than United States currency, we 
agree (a) in the case of each sight draft, to reimburse you, at your issuing 
office, on demand, the equivalent of the amount paid, in United States legal 
tender at the rate of exchange then current for cable transfers to the place of 
payment in the currency in which such draft is drawn, and (b) in the case of 
each acceptance, to furnish you, at said office, on demand, but in any event in 
time to  reach the place of payment in the usual course of the mails not later 
than one business day prior to maturity, with first class banker's demand bills 
of exchange to be approved by you for the amount of the acceptance, payable in 
the currency of the acceptance and bearing our endorsement, or, if you so 
request, to pay to you at said office, on demand, the equivalent of the 
acceptance in United States legal tender at the rate of exchange then current 
for cable transfers to the place of payment in the currency in which the 
acceptance is payable. A demand made on one of us shall fix the exchange rate 
as to all of us, if for any reason whatsoever there shall be at the time of 
your demand for reimbursement or payment no rate of exchange current for 
effective cable transfers to the place of payment in the currency in which any 
such draft is drawn or any such acceptance is payable, we agree to pay you, on 
demand, in United States legal tender an amount which in your sole judgement 
shall be sufficient to meet our obligations hereunder, which amount may be 
applied by you at any time as a payment on account of such obligations, or, at 
your option, held as security therefor; it being understood, however, that we 
shall remain liable for any deficiency which may result if such amount in 
United States legal tender shall prove insufficient to effect full payment or 
reimbursement to you at the time when a rate of exchange for such cable 
transfers shall be again current.

        4.  We also agree to pay to you, on demand, your commission and all 
charges and expenses (including all charges for legal services) paid or 
incurred by you in connection with the Credit, plus correspondents' charges, if 
any, and interest where chargeable.

        5.  That, if the foregoing application requests the inclusion in the 
Credit of any provision for Clean Advances to the beneficiary, you may place in 
the Credit such a provision in that respect as you may deem appropriate, under 
which any bank entitled to negotiate drafts under the Credit, acting in its 
discretion in each instance and upon the request and receipt in writing from 
the beneficiary, may make any one or more Clean Advances at any time on or 
prior to the date by which the drafts are to be negotiated under the Credit. 
The aggregate of such advances shall in no event be more than the amount 
specified in the Application for Clean Advances, and in no event shall any such 
advance exceed the amount remaining available under the Credit at the time of 
the advance. While it is expected by us that each such advance will be repaid 
to the bank that made the advance by the beneficiary from the proceeds of any 
drafts drawn under the Credit, should any such advances not be thus repaid, we 
will on demand pay you the amounts thereof as if such advances were evidenced 
by drafts drawn under the Credit, together with interest on each such amount 
for the period that the same shall have been outstanding at such rate as you 
may find at the time of demand to be payable. It is understood that neither you 
nor any bank which may make such advances shall be obligated to inquire into 
the use that may be made thereof by the beneficiary and that you and each such 
bank shall be without liability for any wrongful use that may be made by the 
beneficiary of any such funds so advanced.

        6.  We hereby recognize and admit your unqualified right to the 
possession and disposal of all property shipped or warehoused under or pursuant 
to or in connection with the Credit or in any way relative thereto or to the 
drafts drawn thereunder, whether or not released to any of us on trust or 
bailee receipt or otherwise, and also in and to all shipping documents, 
warehouse receipts, policies or certifications of insurance and other documents 
accompanying or relative to drafts drawn under the Credit, and in and to the 
proceeds of each and all of the foregoing, until such time as all the 
obligations and liabilities of us or any of us to you at any time existing 
under or with reference to the Credit or this agreement, or any other credit or 
any other obligation or liabilities of us or any of us to you at any time 
existing under or with reference to the Credit or this agreement, or any other 
credit or any other obligation or liability to you, whether now existing or 
hereafter created or arising, have been fully paid and discharged, all as 
security for such obligations and liabilities; and that all or any of such 
property and documents, and the proceeds of any thereof, coming into the 
possession of you or any of your correspondents, may be held and disposed of by 
you as herein provided; and the receipt by you, or any of your correspondents, 
at any time of other security, of whatever nature, including cash, shall not be 
deemed a waiver of any of your rights of powers herein recognized.

        7.  Unless otherwise instructed by you, we agree from time to time to 
give you trust receipts in any form acceptable to you for any property or 
documents released by you to any of us and to sign and deliver to you such 
Statements of Trust Receipt Financing, such Security Agreements and/or such 
Financing Statements as you may from time to time request in any form 
acceptable to you. We will pay any relative filing fees in the event you 
receive some, but not all, of the documents against which availments may be 
made and, at our request, you deliver such documents to us, against trust 
receipt or otherwise, prior to the presentation of the relative draft, we agree 
to pay you on demand the amount of any claim made against you by reason thereof 
and authorize you to pay or accept (as the case may be) such draft when it is 
presented, regardless of whether or not such draft or any document which may 
accompany it complies with the terms of the Credit.

        8.  Except so far as otherwise expressly stated in the Credit, we agree
(a) that you and any of your correspondents may receive and accept, as a "Bill
of Lading" relative to the Credit, any document issued or purporting to be
issued by or on behalf of any carrier which acknowledges receipt of property for
transportation, whatever the specific provisions of such document, and any such
bill of lading issued by or on behalf of an ocean carrier may be accepted by you
as an "Ocean Bill of Lading" whether or not the entire transportation is by
water, and the date of every bill of lading shall be deemed the date of shipment
of the property mentioned therein; and (b) that you and any of your
correspondents may receive and accept as sufficient and controlling the
description of the property contained in the invoice and also receive and accept
bills of lading, insurance and other documents, however variant in description
from that contained in the invoice; and (c) that you and any of your
correspondents may receive and accept bills of lading containing stamped,
written, or typewritten provisions thereon, whether or not signed or initialed,
and you or any of your correspondents may assume conclusively that the same were
placed with proper authority on the bill of lading at the time of its signing
and issuance by the carrier or any agent thereof; and (d) that, if the Credit
states that except so far as otherwise expressly stated it is subject to the
Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1983 Revision), and any
subsequent revision thereof, fixed by the International Chamber of Commerce
(Publication No. 400) (herein called the "Uniform Customs"), the Credit shall be
so subject in all respects; and (e) that, if the Credit does not state that
except so far as otherwise expressly stated it is subject to the Uniform
Customs, you and any of your correspondents may, without limiting the type of
document acceptable according to any other provisions of this agreement, accept
documents of any character which comply with the Uniform Customs or which comply
with the laws or regulations in force and customs and usages of the place of
negotiation; and (f) that you and any of your correspondents may receive and
accept as documents of insurance under the Credit either insurance policies or
insurance certificates which need to be for an amount of insurance greater than
the amount paid by you under or relative to the Credit; and (g) that you and any
of your correspondents may receive, accept and pay as complying with the terms
of the Credit, any drafts or other documents, otherwise in order, which may be
signed by, or issued to, the administrator or executor of, or the trustee in
bankruptcy of, or the receiver for any of the property of, the party in whose
name the Credit provides that any drafts or other documents should be drawn or
issued.


                

<PAGE>   126

        9.   Except as otherwise expressly stated in the Credit, we agree (a) 
that part shipments may be made under the Credit and that you may honor the 
relative drafts without inquiry regardless of any apparent disproportion 
between the quantity shipped and the amount of the relative draft and the total 
amount of the Credit and the total quantity to be shipped under the Credit; and 
(b) that if the Credit specifies shipments in installments within stated 
periods and the shipper fails to ship in any designated period, shipments of 
subsequent installments may nevertheless be made in their respective designated 
periods and you may honor the relative drafts.    

        10.  We agree that in the event of any extension of the maturity or time
for presentation of drafts, acceptances or documents, or any other modification
of the terms of the Credit, at the request of any of us, with or without
notification to the others, or in the event of any increase in the amount of the
Credit at our request, this agreement shall be binding upon us with regard to
the Credit so increased or otherwise modified, to drafts, documents and property
covered thereby, and to any action taken by you or any of your correspondents in
accordance with such extension, increase or other modification.

        11.  We hereby expressly authorize you and any of your correspondents to
accept and pay at your option any drafts drawn under or purporting to be drawn
under the Credit notwithstanding any discrepancies or irregularities between the
drafts and documents presented and those required by the terms of the Credit;
provided that as to discrepancies and irregularities not otherwise covered by
the provisions of this agreement, you or your correspondent so accepting or
paying must be furnished with an indemnity satisfactory to you which, running in
our favor as well as yours covers the discrepancies or irregularities but is
limited to the actual damage directly attributable to such discrepancies or
irregularities.

        12.  We assume all risks of the acts or omissions of the users of the
Credit. We agree that should the beneficiary under the Credit, upon receipt of
advice by cable, or otherwise, of the issuance of the Credit, but prior to its
actual receipt, negotiate drafts by virtue of such advice, such negotiation
shall be considered a proper one and shall be included under the terms and
subject to all conditions hereof, and we assume all the risks of the misuse of
the Credit whatsoever. Neither you nor your correspondents shall be responsible;
for the existence, character, description, quality, quantity, weight, condition,
packing, value, or delivery of the property purporting to be represented by
documents; for any difference in character, description, quality, quantity,
weight, condition, packing or value of the property from that expressed in
documents; for the form, validity, sufficiency, genuineness or legal effect of
documents, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all
respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; for the time, place,
manner or order in which shipment is made; for partial or incomplete shipment,
or failure or omission to ship any or all of the property referred to in the
Credit; for the character, adequacy, validity, or genuineness of any insurance;
for the solvency or responsibility of any insurer, or for any other risk
connected with insurance; for any deviation from instructions, delay, default or
fraud by the shipper or anyone else in connection with the property or the
shipping thereof; for the solvency, responsibility or relationship to the
property of any party issuing any documents in connection with the property; for
delay in arrival or failure to arrive of either the property or any of the
documents relating thereto; for delay in giving or failure to give notice of
arrival or any other notice; for any breach of contract between the shippers or
vendors and ourselves or any of us; for the validity or sufficiency of any
instrument assigning or purporting to assign the Credit or the rights or
benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof in whole or in part, which may prove to
be invalid or ineffective for any reason; for the failure of any draft to bear
any reference or adequate reference to the Credit, or failure of documents to
accompany any draft at negotiation, or failure of documents to accompany any
draft at payment if sent by duplicate mail, or failure of any person to note the
amount of any draft on the reverse of the Credit or to surrender to take up the
Credit or to send forward documents apart from drafts as required by the terms
of the Credit, each of which provisions, if contained in the Credit itself, it
is agreed may be waived by you, or for errors, omissions, interruptions or
delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph,
wireless or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; nor shall you be
responsible for any error, neglect, or default of any of your correspondents for
errors in translation or for errors in interpretation of technical terms or for
any consequences arising from causes beyond your control; and none of the above
shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of any of your rights or powers
hereunder. You shall have the right to transmit the terms of the Credit without
translating them. We shall protect you and any other drawee in paying any draft
dated on or before the expiration of any time limit expressed in the Credit
regardless of when drawn and when or whether negotiated. If the Credit provides
that payment is to be made by your correspondent, neither you nor such
correspondent shall be responsible for the failure of any of the documents
specified in the Credit to come into your hands or for any delay in connection
therewith, and our obligation to reimburse you for payments made or obligations
incurred shall not be affected by such failure or delay in the receipt by you of
any of such documents. In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
specific provisions hereinbefore set forth, we agree that any action taken by
you or any correspondent of yours, under or in connection with the Credit or the
relative drafts, documents or property, if taken in good faith, shall be binding
on us, and shall not put you or your correspondent under any resulting liability
to us; and we make like agreement as to any inaction or omission, unless in
breach of good faith.

        You shall not in any way be liable for any failure by you or anyone else
to pay or accept any draft or acceptance under the Credit resulting from any
censorship, law, control or restriction rightfully or wrongfully exercised by
any de facto or de jure domestic or foreign government or agency or from any
other cause beyond your control or the control of your correspondents, agents or
sub-agents or for any loss or damage to us or anyone else resulting from any
such failure to pay or accept, all such risks being expressly assumed by us, and
we agree to indemnify and hold you harmless from any claim, loss, liability or
expense arising by reason of any such failure to pay or accept. We are
responsible to you for all obligations imposed upon you with respect to the
Credit or the relative drafts, documents or property.

        13.  We agree to procure promptly any necessary import and export or
other licenses for the import or export or shipping of the property and to
comply with all foreign and domestic governmental regulations in regard to the
shipment of the property or the financing thereof, and to furnish such
certificates in that respect as you may at any time require, and to keep the
property adequately covered by insurance satisfactory to you, in companies
satisfactory to you, and to assign the policies or certificates of insurance to
you, or to make the loss or adjustment, if any, payable to you, at your option;
and to furnish you if demanded with evidence of acceptance by the insurers of
such assignment.

        14.  Each of us agrees, at any time and from time to time, on demand, to
deliver to you, as a security for any and all of the liabilities of us and any
of us hereunder and all other liabilities of us and any of us to you, direct or
contingent, joint, several or independent, now or hereafter existing, due or to
become due, whether created directly or acquired by assignment or otherwise,
additional property satisfactory to you or to make such payment as you may
require. Each of us agrees that the balance of every account of us or any of us
with you and each claim of us or any of us against you existing from time to
time, shall be subject to a lien and subject to be set off against any and all
such liabilities of us or any of us; and you may at any time or from time to
time at your option and without notice appropriate and apply toward the payment
of any of such liabilities of us or any of us the balance of each such account
of us or any of us with you and each such claim of us or any of us against you,
and we and each of us will continue liable for any deficiency. Each of us agrees
that all property of every description, now or hereafter in your possession or
custody or in transit to you for any purpose including safekeeping, collection
or pledge, for the account of us or any of us, or as to which we or any of us
may have any interest, right or power, whether or not such property is in whole
or in part released to us or any of us on trust or bailee receipt, are hereby
made security and subject to a lien and security interest in your favor for any
and all such liabilities of us or any of us. You may at any time and from time
to time, without notice, transfer into your own name or that of your nominee any
property so held as collateral. Each of us agrees that upon the failure of us or
any of us at all times to keep a margin of security with you satisfactory to
you, or upon the nonpayment or nonfulfillment of any such liabilities of us or
any of us when they shall become due or be made due, or upon the death or
insolvency of us or any of us, or upon the suspension of business of us or any
of us, or upon the issuance of any warrant of attachment against the credits or
any of the property of us or any of us, or upon the making by us or any of us of
an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or upon the application for the
appointment or the appointment of a trustee or receiver for us or any of us or
for any of the property of us or any of us, or upon the taking possession by any
public official having regulatory powers over any of us of the property of any
of us for the purpose of conserving the assets of any of us, or upon any
proceedings being commenced by or against us or any of us under or purporting to
be under any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of debt,
receivership, liquidation, dissolution, winding up, adjustment, compensation or
liquidation law or statute of any jurisdiction, then and in any such event, (a)
any and all such liabilities of us or any of us shall, at your option, become
and be 
<PAGE>   127
immediately due and payable, without notice, presentation, demand of payment or 
protest, all such being hereby expressly waived, and notwithstanding any credit 
or time allowed to any of us, or any instrument evidencing such liabilities or 
otherwise, and (b) you shall have the right from time to time to sell, resell, 
assign, and deliver all or any part of the property securing any liabilities of 
us or any of us, arrived or to arrive, at any Broker's Board of Exchange, or at 
public or private sale, at your option, without having the property at the 
place of sale, in such parcel or parcels and at such time or times and at such 
place or places, and upon such terms and conditions as you may deem proper, and 
in connection therewith may grant options, all without demand, advertisement or 
notice to us or any of us, all of which are hereby expressly waived, and to 
apply the net proceeds of such sale or sales to the payment of any and all such 
liabilities and we and each of us will continue liable to you for any 
deficiency, with interest. Upon each such sale, you may purchase the whole or 
any part of the property of us or any of us being sold, free from any right of 
redemption, which we and each of us hereby expressly waive and release. Demands 
or calls for collateral on or any notices to us or any of us respectively (a) 
may be made or given by you by leaving same at the last known address of us or 
any of us respectively or by mailing, telegraphing, cabling, radioing, 
telephoning or otherwise sending same to such address, with the same effect as 
if delivered to all of us in person, (b) shall be considered made as of the 
time of such leaving or mailing, telegraphing, cabling, radioing, telephoning 
or other sending by public agencies of communication. Each of us agrees that 
with or without notification to any of us, you may exchange, release, 
surrender, realize upon, release on trust receipt to any of us, or otherwise 
deal with any property by whomsoever pledged, mortgaged, or subjected to a 
security interest to secure directly or indirectly any of the obligations 
hereunder or for which any of the undersigned may be liable.

  We will bear and pay all expenses of every kind (including all charges for 
legal services) of the enforcement of any of your rights herein mentioned, of 
any claim or demand by you against us or any of us, and of any actual or 
attempted sale, exchange, enforcement, collection, maintenance, retention, 
insurance, compromise, settlement, release, delivery on trust receipt, or 
delivery of any such security, and of the receipt of proceeds thereof, and will 
repay to you any such expenses incurred by you.

  15.  None of your options, powers or rights (including those hereunder) shall
be waived unless you or your authorized agent shall have signed such waiver in
writing. No such waiver, unless expressly as stated therein, shall be effective
as to any transaction which occurs subsequent to the date of such waiver, nor as
to any continuance of a breach after such waiver. No segregation or specific
allocation by you of specified collateral against any liability shall waive or
affect any lien of any sort against other securities or property or any of your
options, powers or rights (including those hereunder).

  16.  The word "property" as used in this agreement includes goods, 
merchandise, securities, funds, changes in action, and any and all other forms 
of property, whether real, personal or mixed and any right or interest therein. 
Property in your possession shall include property in possession of anyone for 
you in any manner whatsoever. Your options, powers and rights specified in this 
agreement are in addition to those otherwise created. You are hereby expressly 
given the right and power in furtherance of any right, power or privilege which 
you may have hereunder or in connection with the Credit to execute 
endorsements, assignments or other instruments of conveyance or transfer in our 
name, place and stead covering any property standing in our name or belonging 
to us of every kind and description which you may hold or which may come into 
your possession under the Credit or by reason of this agreement.

  17.  If the undersigned is a banking institution, the undersigned hereby 
appoints you as its agent to the extent of issuing the Credit in accordance 
with, and subject to the terms and provisions of, the foregoing Application and 
Agreement for Commercial Letter of Credit.

  18.  If the undersigned is a partnership, the obligations hereof shall 
continue in force, and apply, notwithstanding any change in the membership of 
such partnership, whether arising from the death or retirement of one or more 
partners or the addition of one or more new partners.

  19.  This agreement shall be binding upon us, our heirs, executors, 
administrators, successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of, and 
to be enforceable by, you, your heirs, executors, administrators, successors, 
transferees and assigns. If this agreement should be terminated or revoked by 
operation of law as to us, or any of us, we will indemnify and save you 
harmless from any loss which may be suffered or incurred by you in acting 
hereunder prior to the receipt by you, or your transferees or assigns, of 
notice in writing of such termination or revocation. If this agreement is 
signed by two or more parties, it shall be the joint and several agreement of 
such parties and whenever used herein, the singular number shall include the 
plural, and the plural the singular. The agreement shall be governed by and 
construed in accordance with the law of the state in which the Bank One 
affiliate specified in this application and agreement has its principal office.

  20.  In the event that we fail to pay you on demand any amounts due you
       arising under the terms of this Application we will pay you in the
       following manner: ________ (a) in addition to the aforesaid amounts,
       interest on the amounts due you at the rate equivalent to your "Prime
       Lending Rate" in effect from time to time, plus ________% per annum
       calculated on a ________ day year basis, calculated on the actual number
       of days elapsed during the lending period. "Prime Lending Rate" means the
       rate announced from time to time by Bank One as its Prime Lending Rate
       which rate may not be the lowest rate of interest offered by Bank One.
       The rate of interest will be adjusted on the same day as Bank One's Prime
       Lending Rate changes. All amounts due hereunder including interest and
       principal shall be payable upon demand by you.

       ________ (b) We request that you activate the Promissory Note in your
       possession payable to you which we have heretofore executed.

       Any deferred payments to be made under (a) or (b) above shall be:
       ________ unsecured (subject however, to the rights granted you in this
       Application). ________ secured by the following described property and
       the proceeds thereof (which property is in addition to that otherwise
       described in this Application); _________________________________________
       _________________________________________________________________________
       _________________________________________________________________________
       which property has been deposited with you, or to which a security
       interest is hereby given to you. You shall have all the rights and
       remedies in connection with said property as set forth in this
