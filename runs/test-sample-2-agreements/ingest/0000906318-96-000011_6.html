and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties
hereto hereby agree as follows:

                   SECTION ONE - AMENDMENTS.

          The Credit Agreement is amended as hereinafter
provided in this Section ONE, effective as of January 23, 1996

      D-M-E Company ("D-M-E") from the Fairchild Corporation for
      an aggregate purchase price of $240,000,000, subject to
      adjustment, no greater than 5%, upon and after the
      consummation of such acquisition."

      "'Consolidated EBITDA' means, without duplication, for any
      consecutive four fiscal quarter period, the sum of the
      amounts for such period of (i) the Company's Consolidated
      Net Income, excluding therefrom any extraordinary
      nonrecurring items of gain or loss, plus (ii) the
      aggregate amounts deducted in determining Consolidated Net
      Income for such period in respect of (a) the provision for
      taxes based on income of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
      (b) Interest Expense and (c) depreciation and amortization
      expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all as
      determined on a consolidated basis for the Company and its
      Subsidiaries for such period in conformity with GAAP;
      provided, that for purposes of calculating Consolidated
      EBITDA of the Company for any rolling four quarters period
      that includes any fiscal quarter of 1995, the
      restructuring charges taken in fiscal 1995 relating to the
      consolidation of certain Widia operations shall be
      excluded from the determination of Consolidated Net Income
      of the Company for the relevant period, but only to the
      extent such non-recurring charges do not exceed
      $25,000,000.  Notwithstanding any provision of this
      Agreement, following the D-M-E Acquisition Date,
      Consolidated EBITDA shall be calculated by adding
      $5,000,000 to the Consolidated EBITDA for each quarter of

      which Consolidated EBITDA is calculated."

Consolidated Total Indebtedness, as calculated for such
