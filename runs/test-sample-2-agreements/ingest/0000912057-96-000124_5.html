                 (e)  Nothing contained herein shall require any Bank to fund
       any Eurodollar Rate Advance from deposits obtained in the Designated
       Eurodollar Market.

            2.4  LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                 (a)  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at any time
       and from time to time from the Closing Date to, but not including, the
       Line A Maturity Date, the Issuing Bank shall issue such Line A Letters of
       Credit as Borrower may request by a Request for Letter of Credit;
       PROVIDED that (i) giving effect to all such Line A Letters of Credit, the
       SUM of (A) the aggregate principal Indebtedness outstanding under the
       Line A Notes PLUS (B) the Aggregate Effective Amount of all outstanding
       Line A Letters of Credit do not exceed the LESSER OF (y) the Borrowing
       Base then in effect and (z) the Line A Commitment then in effect and
       (ii) the Aggregate Effective Amount under all outstanding Line A Letters
       of Credit shall not exceed $5,000,000 at any time on or prior to
       January 2, 1996, or $3,000,000 at any time thereafter.  Subject to the
       terms and conditions hereof, on the Closing Date the Issuing Bank shall
       issue such Line B Letters of Credit as Borrower may request by a Request
       for Letter of Credit; PROVIDED that (i) giving effect to such Line B
       Letters of Credit, the SUM OF (A) the aggregate principal Indebtedness
       outstanding under the Line B Notes PLUS (B) the Aggregate Effective
       Amount of such Line B Letters of Credit does not exceed the Line B
       Commitment and (ii) the Issuing Bank shall not be obligated to issue any
       Line B Letter of Credit subsequent to the Closing Date.  Each Letter of
       Credit shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Issuing Bank.
       Unless the Issuing Bank otherwise consents, the term of any Line A Letter
       of Credit shall not exceed 365 days and the term of any Line B Letter of
       Credit shall not exceed 45 days.  Unless all the Banks otherwise consent
       in a writing delivered to the Agent, the term of any Line A Letter of
       Credit shall not extend beyond the Line A Maturity Date and the term of
       any Line B Letter of Credit shall not extend beyond the Line B Maturity
       Date.  A Request for Letter of Credit shall be irrevocable absent the
       consent of the Issuing Bank, which consent shall not be unreasonably
       withheld or delayed.

                 (b)  Each Request for Letter of Credit shall be submitted to
       the Issuing Bank, with a copy to the Agent, at least three (3) Banking
       Days prior to the date upon which the related Letter of Credit is
       proposed to be issued.  The Agent shall promptly notify the Issuing Bank
       whether such Request for Letter of Credit, and the issuance of a Letter
       of Credit pursuant thereto, conforms


                                      -38-

<PAGE>


       to the requirements of this Agreement.  Upon issuance of a Letter of
       Credit, the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Agent, and the Agent
       shall promptly notify the Banks, of the amount and terms thereof.

                 (c)  Upon the issuance of a Letter of Credit, each Bank shall
       be deemed to have purchased a pro rata participation in such Letter of
       Credit from the Issuing Bank in proportion to that Bank's Pro Rata Share
       of the Line A Commitment or Line B Commitment (as applicable).  Without
       limiting the scope and nature of each Bank's participation in any Letter
       of Credit, to the extent that the Issuing Bank has not been reimbursed by
       Borrower for any payment required to be made by the Issuing Bank under
       any Letter of Credit, each Bank shall, pro rata according to its Pro Rata
       Share of the Line A Commitment or Line B Commitment (as applicable),
       reimburse the Issuing Bank through the Agent promptly upon demand for the
       amount of such payment.  The obligation of each Bank to so reimburse the
       Issuing Bank shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be
       affected by the occurrence of an Event of Default or any other occurrence
       or event.  Any such reimbursement shall not relieve or otherwise impair
       the obligation of Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Bank for the amount
       of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit
       together with interest as hereinafter provided.

                 (d)  Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuing Bank through the
       Agent an amount equal to any payment made by the Issuing Bank with
       respect to each Letter of Credit within one (1) Banking Day after demand
       made by the Issuing Bank therefor, together with interest on such amount
       from the date of any payment made by the Issuing Bank at the rate
       applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans for the period commencing on the
       date of any such payment and continuing through the first Banking Day
       following such demand and thereafter at the Default Rate.  The principal
       amount of any such payment shall be used to reimburse the Issuing Bank
       for the payment made by it under the Letter of Credit.  Each Bank that
       has reimbursed the Issuing Bank pursuant to SECTION 2.4(c) for its Pro
       Rata Share of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of
       Credit shall thereupon acquire a pro rata participation, to the extent of
       such reimbursement, in the claim of the Issuing Bank against Borrower
       under this SECTION 2.4(d) and shall share, in accordance with that
       pro-rata participation, in any payment made by Borrower with respect to
       such claim.  Upon receipt of any such reimbursement from Borrower, the
       Issuing Bank shall pay to the Agent, for the ratable benefit of those
       Banks that had reimbursed the Issuing Bank pursuant to SECTION 2.4(c) for



                                      -39-

<PAGE>


their respective Pro Rata Shares of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under a
Letter of Credit to which such reimbursement applies, the amount of such
reimbursement.

                 (e)  If Borrower fails to make the payment required by
       SECTION 2.4(d) within the time period therein set forth, in lieu of the
       reimbursement to the Issuing Bank under SECTION 2.4(c) the Issuing Bank
       may (but is not required to), without notice to or the consent of
       Borrower, instruct the Agent to cause Advances to be made by the Banks
       under the Line A Commitment or Line B Commitment (as applicable) in an
       aggregate amount equal to the amount paid by the Issuing Bank with
       respect to that Letter of Credit and, for this purpose, the conditions
       precedent set forth in ARTICLE 8 shall not apply.  The proceeds of such
       Advances shall be paid to the Issuing Bank to reimburse it for the
       payment made by it under the Letter of Credit.  Such Advances shall be
       payable upon demand and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

                 (f)  The issuance of any supplement, modification, amendment,
       renewal, or extension to or of any Letter of Credit shall be treated in
       all respects the same as the issuance of a new Letter of Credit.

                 (g)  The obligation of Borrower to pay to the Issuing Bank the
       amount of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit
       shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, subject only to
       performance by the Issuing Bank of its obligations to Borrower under
       Section 5109 of the Uniform Commercial Code.  Without limiting the
       foregoing, Borrower's obligations shall not be affected by any of the
       following circumstances:

                 (i)  any lack of validity or enforceability of the Letter of
            Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument
            relating thereto;

                (ii)  any amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure
            from the Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or
            instrument relating thereto, with the consent of Borrower;

               (iii)  the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other
            rights which Borrower may have at any time against the Issuing Bank,
            the Agent or any Bank, any beneficiary of the Letter of Credit (or
            any persons or entities for whom any such beneficiary may be acting)
            or any other Person, whether in connection with the Letter of
            Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument
            relating thereto, or any unrelated transactions;

            insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
            inaccurate in any respect whatsoever so long as any such document
            reasonably appeared to comply with the terms of the Letter of
            Credit;

                 (v)  payment by the Issuing Bank in good faith under the Letter
            of Credit against presentation of a draft or any accompanying
            document which does not strictly comply with the terms of the Letter
            of Credit;

                (vi)  the existence, character, quality, quantity, condition,
            packing, value or delivery of any Property purported to be
            represented by documents presented in connection with any Letter of
            Credit or for any difference between any such Property and the
            character, quality, quantity, condition or value of such Property as
            described in such documents;

               (vii)  the time, place, manner, order or contents of shipments or
            deliveries of Property as described in documents presented in
            connection with any Letter of Credit or the existence, nature and
            extent of any insurance relative thereto;

              (viii)  the solvency or financial responsibility of any party
            issuing any documents in connection with a Letter of Credit;

                (ix)  any failure or delay in notice of shipments or arrival of
            any Property;

                 (x)  any error in the transmission of any message relating to a
            Letter of Credit not caused by the Issuing Bank, or any delay or
            interruption in any such message;

                (xi)  any error, neglect or default of any correspondent of the
            Issuing Bank in connection with a Letter of Credit;

               (xii)  any consequence arising from acts of God, war,
            insurrection, civil unrest, disturbances, labor disputes, emergency
            conditions or other causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank;
            and

              (xiii)  so long as the Issuing Bank in good faith determines that
            the contract or document appears to comply with the terms of the
            Letter of Credit, the form, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of
            any contract or document referred to in any document submitted to
            the Issuing Bank in connection with a Letter of Credit.

                 (h)  The Issuing Bank VIS-A-VIS the Banks shall be entitled to
       the protection accorded to the Agent VIS-A-VIS the Banks pursuant to
       SECTION 10.6, MUTATIS MUTANDIS.

                 (i)  The Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary Credits,

       Commerce, shall be deemed a part of this Section and shall apply to all
       Letters of Credit to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Law.

            2.5  VOLUNTARY REDUCTION OF LINE A COMMITMENT.  Borrower shall have
the right, at any time and from time to time, without penalty or charge, upon at

aggregate principal amounts in an integral multiple of $500,000 but not less
than $2,000,000, or to terminate, all or a portion of the then undisbursed
portion of the Line A Commitment, PROVIDED that any such reduction or
termination shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued and unpaid commitment
fees with respect to the portion of the Line A Commitment being reduced or
terminated.  The Agent shall promptly notify the Banks of any reduction or
termination of the Line A Commitment under this Section.

            2.6  AUTOMATIC REDUCTION OF LINE B COMMITMENT.  On each Amortization
Date, the Line B Commitment shall automatically be reduced by the applicable
Amortization Amount.

            2.7  OPTIONAL TERMINATION OF COMMITMENTS.  Following the occurrence
of a Change in Control, the Requisite Banks may in their sole and absolute
discretion elect, during the sixty (60) day period immediately subsequent to the
LATER OF (a) such occurrence or (b) the EARLIER of (i) receipt of Borrower's
written notice to the Agent of such occurrence or (ii) if no such notice has
been received by the Agent, the date upon which the Agent has actual knowledge
thereof, to terminate the Commitments, in which case the Commitments shall be
terminated effective on the date which is thirty (30) days subsequent to written

            2.8  AGENT'S RIGHT TO ASSUME FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR ADVANCES.  Unless

<PAGE>


Bank no later than the Banking Day prior to the funding by the Agent of any Loan
that such Bank does not intend to make available to the Agent such Bank's
portion of the total amount of such Loan, the Agent may assume that such Bank
has made such amount available to the Agent on the date of the Loan and the
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower a
corresponding amount.  If the Agent has made funds available to Borrower based
on such assumption and such corresponding amount is not in fact made available
to the Agent by such Bank, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such
corresponding amount on demand from such Bank.  If such Bank does not pay such
corresponding amount forthwith upon the Agent's demand therefor, the Agent
promptly shall notify Borrower and Borrower shall pay such corresponding amount

       to the Alternate Base Rate PLUS the Applicable Alternate Base Rate
       Margin.  Each change in the interest rate under this Section 3.1(b) due
       to a change in the Alternate Base Rate shall take effect simultaneously
       with the corresponding change in the Alternate Base Rate.

       shall be due and payable on the date that is three months after the first
       day of the related Eurodollar Period, every three months thereafter and
       on the last day of the Eurodollar Period.  EXCEPT as otherwise provided

       Requisite Banks may determine that any or all then outstanding Eurodollar
       Rate Loans shall be converted to Alternate Base Rate Loans.  Such
       conversion shall be effective upon notice to Borrower from the Requisite
       Banks (or from the Agent on behalf of the Requisite Banks) and shall
       continue so long as such Default or Event of Default continues to exist.

                 (e)  If not sooner paid, the principal Indebtedness evidenced

            Borrowing Base then in effect and (Z) the Line A Commitment then in
            effect, shall be payable immediately;

                      (ii)      the amount, if any by which the SUM OF (A) the
            principal outstanding Indebtedness evidenced by the Line B Notes

            shall be payable on each respective Amortization Date;

                      (iv)      the principal outstanding Indebtedness evidenced

       receipt by Borrower of Cash proceeds from the issuance and sale by
       Borrower of any equity security of Borrower, in an amount equal to such
       Cash proceeds, net of any out-of-pocket expenses directly related
       thereto.  Such prepayments shall be applied to the then most remote
       Amortization Amount.

                 (g)  The Notes may, at any time and from time to time,
       voluntarily be prepaid in whole or in part without premium or penalty;
       PROVIDED that with respect to any voluntary prepayment under this
       Section (i) any partial prepayment shall be not less than $1,000,000,
       (ii) the Agent shall have received written notice of any prepayment by

       prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan, which notice shall identify the
       date and amount of the prepayment and the Loan(s) being prepaid,
       (iii) each prepayment of principal on any Eurodollar Rate Loan shall be
       accompanied by payment of interest accrued to the date of payment on the
       amount of principal paid, (iv) any payment or prepayment of all or any
       part of any Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the

       (v) upon any partial prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan that reduces it
       below $2,000,000, the remaining portion thereof shall automatically
       convert to an Alternate Base Rate Loan.

            3.2  ARRANGEMENT FEE.  On the Closing Date, Borrower shall pay to

in such amounts and at such times as heretofore agreed upon by that certain

The fees paid to the Agent are solely for its own account and are nonrefundable.

            3.4  COMMITMENT FEES.  From and including the Closing Date, and for
so long as any portion of the Line A Commitment remains in effect, Borrower
shall pay to the Agent, for the ratable accounts of the Banks pro rata according

Applicable Commitment Fee Rate per annum TIMES the average daily amount by which
the Line A Commitment exceeds the SUM OF (a) the aggregate principal
Indebtedness evidenced by the Line A Notes PLUS (b) the Aggregate Effective
Amount of all Line A Letters of Credit outstanding.  The commitment fee shall be
payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and on the Line A
Maturity Date.

            3.5  LETTER OF CREDIT FEES.  Concurrently with the issuance of each
Letter of Credit, Borrower shall pay a letter of credit issuance fee to the
Issuing Bank, for the sole account of the Issuing Bank, in an amount equal to
1/4 of 1% (25 basis points) per annum of the face amount of such Letter of
Credit for the term of such Letter of Credit.  Borrower shall also concurrently
pay to the Agent, for the ratable account of the Banks in accordance with their
Pro Rata Share of the Line A Commitment or Line B Commitment (as applicable), a
standby letter of credit fee in an amount equal to the Applicable Standby Letter
of Credit Fee per annum TIMES the face amount of such Letter of Credit for the
term of such Letter of Credit.  In addition to the foregoing, in connection with
a Letter of Credit and activity relating thereto, Borrower shall also pay
amendment, transfer, issuance, negotiation and such other fees as the Issuing
Bank normally charges (not to include origination fees), in the amounts set
forth from time to time as the Issuing Bank's published scheduled fees for such

                                      -46-

of Credit under this Section is earned when due and is nonrefundable.

            3.6  INCREASED COMMITMENT COSTS.  If any Bank shall determine in
good faith that the introduction after the Closing Date of any applicable law,
rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein
or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any central
bank or other Governmental Agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by such Bank (or its Eurodollar Lending
Office) or any corporation controlling the Bank, with any request, guideline or
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such central bank or other authority, affects or would affect the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by such Bank or any corporation
controlling such Bank and (taking into consideration such Bank's or such
corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Bank's desired
return on capital) determines in good faith that the amount of such capital is
increased, or the rate of return on capital is reduced, as a consequence of its
obligations under this Agreement, then, within ten (10) Banking Days after
demand of such Bank, Borrower shall pay to such Bank, from time to time as
specified in good faith by such Bank, additional amounts sufficient to
compensate such Bank in light of such circumstances, to the extent reasonably
allocable to such obligations under this Agreement.

            3.7  EURODOLLAR COSTS AND RELATED MATTERS.

                 (a)  If, after the date hereof, the existence or occurrence of
       any Special Eurodollar Circumstance:

                 (1)  shall subject any Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office to
            any tax, duty or other charge or cost with respect to any Eurodollar
            Rate Advance, any of its Notes evidencing Eurodollar Rate Loans or
            its obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances, or shall change the
            basis of taxation of payments to any Bank attributable to the
            principal of or interest on any Eurodollar Rate Advance or any other
            amounts due under this Agreement in respect of any Eurodollar Rate
            Advance, any of its Notes evidencing Eurodollar Rate Loans or its
            obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances, EXCLUDING (i) taxes
            imposed on or measured in whole or in part by its overall net
            income, gross income or gross receipts or capital and franchise
            taxes imposed on it, by (A) any jurisdiction (or political
            subdivision thereof) in which it is organized or maintains its
            principal office or Eurodollar Lending Office or (B) any
            jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) in which it is
            "doing


                                      -47-

<PAGE>


            business" (unless it would not be doing business in such
            jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) absent the
            transactions contemplated hereby), (ii) any withholding taxes or
            other taxes based on gross income imposed by the United States of
            America (other than withholding taxes and taxes based on gross
            income resulting from or attributable to any change in any law, rule
            or regulation or any change in the interpretation or administration
            of any law, rule or regulation by any Governmental Agency) or
            (iii) any withholding taxes or other taxes based on gross income
            imposed by the United States of America for any period with respect
            to which it has failed to provide Borrower with the appropriate form
            or forms required by SECTION 11.21, to the extent such forms are
            then required by applicable Laws;

                 (2)  shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve not
            applicable or deemed applicable on the date hereof (INCLUDING,
            without limitation, any reserve imposed by the Board of Governors of
            the Federal Reserve System, BUT EXCLUDING the Eurodollar Reserve
            Percentage taken into account in calculating the Eurodollar Rate),
            special deposit, capital or similar requirements against assets of,
            deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Bank
            or its Eurodollar Lending Office; or

                 (3)  shall impose on any Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office
            or the Designated Eurodollar Market any other condition affecting
            any Eurodollar Rate Advance, any of its Notes evidencing Eurodollar
            Rate Loans, its obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or this
            Agreement, or shall otherwise affect any of the same;

       and the result of any of the foregoing, as determined in good faith by
       such Bank, increases the cost to such Bank or its Eurodollar Lending
       Office of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Advance or in respect
       of any Eurodollar Rate Advance, any of its Notes evidencing Eurodollar
       Rate Loans or its obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or reduces
       the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Bank or its
       Eurodollar Lending Office with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advance,
       any of its Notes evidencing Eurodollar Rate Loans or its obligation to
       make Eurodollar Rate Advances (assuming such Bank's Eurodollar Lending
       Office had funded 100% of its Eurodollar Rate Advance in the Designated
       Eurodollar Market), then, within five (5) Banking Days after demand by
       such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), Borrower shall pay to such Bank
       such additional amount or amounts as will


                                      -48-

<PAGE>


       compensate such Bank for such increased cost or reduction (determined as
       though such Bank's Eurodollar Lending Office had funded 100% of its
       Eurodollar Rate Advance in the Designated Eurodollar Market).  Borrower
       hereby indemnifies each Bank against, and agrees to hold each Bank
       harmless from and reimburse such Bank within ten (10) Banking Days after
       demand for (without duplication) all costs, expenses, claims, penalties,
       liabilities, losses, reasonable legal fees and damages incurred or
       sustained by each Bank in connection with this Agreement, or any of the
       rights, obligations or transactions provided for or contemplated herein,
       as a direct result of the existence or occurrence of any Special
       Eurodollar Circumstance.  A statement of any Bank claiming compensation
       under this subsection and setting forth in reasonable detail the
       additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be
       conclusive in the absence of manifest error.  Each Bank agrees to
       endeavor promptly to notify Borrower of any event of which it has actual
       knowledge, occurring after the Closing Date, which will entitle such Bank
       to compensation pursuant to this Section, and agrees to designate a
       different Eurodollar Lending Office if such designation will avoid the
       need for or reduce the amount of such compensation and will not, in the
       good faith judgment of such Bank, otherwise be materially disadvantageous
       to such Bank.  If any Bank claims compensation under this Section,
       Borrower may at any time, upon at least three (3) Eurodollar Banking
       Days' prior notice to the Agent and such Bank and upon payment in full of
       the amounts provided for in this Section through the date of such payment
       PLUS any prepayment fee required by Section 3.6(d), pay in full the
       affected Eurodollar Rate Advances of such Bank or convert such Eurodollar
       Rate Advances to Alternate Base Rate Advances.

                 (b)  If, after the date hereof, the existence or occurrence of
       any Special Eurodollar Circumstance shall, in the good faith opinion of
       any Bank, make it unlawful or impossible for such Bank or its Eurodollar
       Lending Office to make, maintain or fund its portion of any Eurodollar
       Rate Loan, or materially restrict the authority of such Bank to purchase
       or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the Designated Eurodollar
       Market, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
       Eurodollar Rate, and such Bank shall so notify the Agent, then such
       Bank's obligation to make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended for
       the duration of such illegality or impossibility and the Agent forthwith
       shall give notice thereof to the other Banks and Borrower.  Upon receipt
       of such notice, the outstanding principal amount of such Bank's
       Eurodollar Rate Advances, together with accrued interest thereon,
       automatically shall be converted to


                                      -49-

<PAGE>


       Alternate Base Rate Advances with Eurodollar Periods corresponding to the
       Eurodollar Loans of which such Eurodollar Rate Advances were a part on
       either (1) the last day of the Eurodollar Period(s) applicable to such
       Eurodollar Rate Advances if such Bank may lawfully continue to maintain
       and fund such Eurodollar Rate Advances to such day(s) or (2) immediately
       if such Bank may not lawfully continue to fund and maintain such
       Eurodollar Rate Advances to such day(s), PROVIDED that in such event the
       conversion shall not be subject to payment of a prepayment fee under
       Section 3.7(d).  Each Bank agrees to endeavor promptly to notify Borrower
       of any event of which it has actual knowledge, occurring after the
       Closing Date, which will cause that Bank to notify the Agent under this
       Section, and agrees to designate a different Eurodollar Lending Office if
       such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the
       good faith judgment of such Bank, otherwise be materially disadvantageous
       to such Bank.  In the event that any Bank is unable, for the reasons set
       forth above, to make, maintain or fund its portion of any Eurodollar Rate
       Loan, such Bank shall fund such amount as an Alternate Base Rate Advance
       for the same period of time, and such amount shall be treated in all
       respects as an Alternate Base Rate Advance.  Any Bank whose obligation to
       make Eurodollar Rate Advances has been suspended under this Section shall
       promptly notify the Agent and Borrower of the cessation of the Special
       Eurodollar Circumstance which gave rise to such suspension.

                 (c)  If, with respect to any proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan:

                 (1)  the Agent reasonably determines that, by reason of
            circumstances affecting the Designated Eurodollar Market generally
            that are beyond the reasonable control of the Banks, deposits in
            Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to any
            Bank in the Designated Eurodollar Market for the applicable
            Eurodollar Period; or

                 (2)  the Requisite Banks advise the Agent that the Eurodollar
            Rate as determined by the Agent (i) does not represent the effective
            pricing to such Banks for deposits in Dollars in the Designated
            Eurodollar Market in the relevant amount for the applicable
            Eurodollar Period, or (ii) will not adequately and fairly reflect
            the cost to such Banks of making the applicable Eurodollar Rate
            Advances;

       then the Agent forthwith shall give notice thereof to Borrower and the
       Banks, whereupon until the Agent notifies


                                      -50-

<PAGE>


       Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer
       exist, the obligation of the Banks to make any future Eurodollar Rate
       Advances shall be suspended.  If at the time of such notice there is then
       pending a Request for Loan that specifies a Eurodollar Rate Loan, such
       Request for Loan shall be deemed to specify an Alternate Base Rate Loan.

                 (d)  Upon payment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Advance
       (OTHER THAN as the result of a conversion required under Section 3.7(b)),
       on a day other than the last day in the applicable Eurodollar Period
       (whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by reason of acceleration, or
       otherwise), or upon the failure of Borrower (for a reason other than the
       failure of a Bank to make an Advance) to borrow on the date or in the
       amount specified for a Eurodollar Rate Loan in any Request for Loan,
       Borrower shall pay to the appropriate Bank within ten (10) Banking Days
       after demand a prepayment fee or failure to borrow fee, as the case may
       be (determined as though 100% of the Eurodollar Rate Advance had been
       funded in the Designated Eurodollar Market) equal to the SUM of:

                 (1)  the principal amount of the Eurodollar Rate Advance
            prepaid or not borrowed, as the case may be, TIMES [the number of
            days between the date of prepayment or failure to borrow, as
            applicable, and the last day in the applicable Eurodollar Period],
            DIVIDED BY 360, TIMES the applicable Interest Differential (PROVIDED
            that the product of the foregoing formula must be a positive
            number); PLUS

                 (2)  all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Bank reasonably
            and directly attributable to such payment, prepayment or failure to
            borrow.

       Each Bank's determination of the amount of any prepayment fee payable
       under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

            3.8  LATE PAYMENTS.  If any installment of principal or interest or
any fee or cost or other amount payable under any Loan Document to the Agent or
any Bank is not paid when due, it shall thereafter bear interest at a
fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the SUM OF the
Alternate Base Rate PLUS the Applicable Alternate Base Rate Margin PLUS 2%, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.  Accrued and unpaid interest on
past due amounts (INCLUDING, without limitation, interest on past due interest)
shall be compounded monthly, on the last day of each calendar month, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

            3.9  COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.  Computation of interest on
Alternate Base Rate Loans shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365
or 366 days, as the case may be, and the actual number of days elapsed;
computation of interest on Eurodollar Rate Loans and all fees under this
Agreement shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual
number of days elapsed.  Borrower acknowledges that such latter calculation
method will result in a higher yield to the Banks than a method based on a year
of 365 or 366 days.  Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the
Loan is made; interest shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for
the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid.  Any Loan that is repaid on
the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, interest in excess
of the maximum amount permitted by applicable Laws shall not accrue or be
payable hereunder or under the Notes, and any amount paid as interest hereunder
or under the Notes which would otherwise be in excess of such maximum permitted
amount shall instead be treated as a payment of principal.

            3.10  NON-BANKING DAYS.  If any payment to be made by Borrower or
any other Party under any Loan Document shall come due on a day other than a
Banking Day, payment shall instead be considered due on the next succeeding
Banking Day and the extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest
and fees.

            3.11  MANNER AND TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS.

                 (a)  Each payment hereunder (EXCEPT payments pursuant to
       SECTIONS 3.6, 3.7, 11.3, 11.11 and 11.22) or on the Notes or under any
       other Loan Document shall be made to the Agent, at the Agent's Office,
       for the account of each of the Banks or the Agent, as the case may be, in
       immediately available funds not later than 11:00 a.m., Los Angeles time,
       on the day of payment (which must be a Banking Day).  All payments
       received after 11:00 a.m., Los Angeles time, on any Banking Day, shall be
       deemed received on the next succeeding Banking Day.  The amount of all
       payments received by the Agent for the account of each Bank shall be
       immediately paid by the Agent to the applicable Bank in immediately
       available funds and, if such payment was received by the Agent by
       11:00 a.m., Los Angeles time, on a Banking Day and not so made available
       to the account of a Bank on that Banking Day, the Agent shall reimburse
       that Bank for the cost to such Bank of funding the amount of such payment
       at the Federal Funds Rate.  All payments shall be made in lawful money of
       the United States of America.


                                      -52-

<PAGE>


                 (b)  Each payment or prepayment on account of any Loan shall be
       applied pro rata according to the outstanding Advances made by each Bank
       comprising such Loan.

                 (c)  Each Bank shall use its best efforts to keep a record of
       Advances made by it and payments received by it with respect to each of
       its Notes and, subject to Section 10.6(g), such record shall, as against
       Borrower, be presumptive evidence of the amounts owing.  Notwithstanding
       the foregoing sentence, no Bank shall be liable to any Party for any
       failure to keep such a record.

                 (d)  Each payment of any amount payable by Borrower or any
       other Party under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made
       free and clear of, and without reduction by reason of, any taxes,
       assessments or other charges imposed by any Governmental Agency, central
       bank or comparable authority, EXCLUDING (i) taxes imposed on or measured
       in whole or in part by its overall net income, gross income or gross
       receipts or capital and franchise taxes imposed on it, by (A) any
       jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) in which it is organized
       or maintains its principal office or Eurodollar Lending Office or (B) any
       jurisdiction (or political subdivision thereof) in which it is "doing
       business" (unless it would not be doing business in such jurisdiction (or
       political subdivision thereof) absent the transactions contemplated
       hereby), (ii) any withholding taxes or other taxes based on gross income
       imposed by the United States of America (other than withholding taxes and
       taxes based on gross income resulting from or attributable to any change
       in any law, rule or regulation or any change in the interpretation or
       administration of any law, rule or regulation by any Governmental Agency)
       or (iii) any withholding taxes or other taxes based on gross income
       imposed by the United States of America for any period with respect to
       which it has failed to provide Borrower with the appropriate form or
       forms required by SECTION 11.21, to the extent such forms are then
       required by applicable Laws (all such excluded taxes, assessments or
       other charges being hereinafter referred to as "Excluded Taxes").  To the
       extent that Borrower is obligated by applicable Laws to make any
       deduction or withholding on account of taxes, assessments and other
       charges (OTHER THAN Excluded Taxes) from any amount payable to any Bank
       under this Agreement, Borrower shall (i) make such deduction or
       withholding and pay the same to the relevant Governmental Agency and
       (ii) pay such additional amount to that Bank as is necessary to result in
       that Bank's receiving a net after-tax amount equal to the amount to which
       that Bank would have been entitled under this Agreement absent such
       deduction or withholding.


                                      -53-

<PAGE>


       If and when receipt of such payment results in an excess payment or
       credit to that Bank on account of such taxes, assessments and other
       charges, that Bank shall promptly refund such excess to Borrower.

            3.12  FUNDING SOURCES.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
obligate any Bank to obtain the funds for any Loan or Advance in any particular
place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Bank that it has
obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan or Advance in any particular
place or manner.

            3.13  FAILURE TO CHARGE NOT SUBSEQUENT WAIVER.  Any decision by the
Agent or any Bank not to require payment of any interest (INCLUDING interest
arising under Section 3.8), fee, cost or other amount payable under any Loan
Document, or to calculate any amount payable by a particular method, on any
occasion shall in no way limit or be deemed a waiver of the Agent's or such
Bank's right to require full payment of any interest (INCLUDING interest arising
under Section 3.8), fee, cost or other amount payable under any Loan Document,
or to calculate an amount payable by another method that is not inconsistent
with this Agreement, on any other or subsequent occasion.

            3.14  AGENT'S RIGHT TO ASSUME PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE BY BORROWER.
Unless the Agent shall have been notified by Borrower prior to the date on which
any payment to be made by Borrower hereunder is due that Borrower does not
intend to remit such payment, the Agent may, in its discretion, assume that
Borrower has remitted such payment when so due and the Agent may, in its
discretion and in reliance upon such assumption, make available to each Bank on
such payment date an amount equal to such Bank's share of such assumed payment.
If Borrower has not in fact remitted such payment to the Agent, each Bank shall
forthwith on demand repay to the Agent the amount of such assumed payment made
available to such Bank, together with interest thereon in respect of each day
from and including the date such amount was made available by the Agent to such
Bank to the date such amount is repaid to the Agent at the Federal Funds Rate.

            3.15  AUTOMATIC DEBIT.  Borrower hereby authorizes the Agent to
automatically debit the Designated Deposit Account for the amount of all
payments (principal, interest, fees and otherwise) due to the Agent or the Banks
pursuant to this Agreement on the date such payments are due.  Either Borrower
or the Agent may terminate this automatic debit arrangement upon five (5)
Banking Days notice to the other.

            3.16  FEE DETERMINATION DETAIL.  The Agent, and any Bank, shall
provide reasonable detail to Borrower regarding the


                                      -54-

<PAGE>


manner in which the amount of any payment to the Agent and the Banks, or that
Bank, under ARTICLE 3 has been determined, concurrently with demand for such
payment.

            3.17  SURVIVABILITY.  All of Borrower's obligations under
Sections 3.6, 3.7 and 3.11(d) shall survive for one (1) year following the date
on which the Commitments are terminated and all Loans hereunder are fully paid.

                                    Article 4
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


            Borrower represents and warrants to the Banks that:

            4.1  EXISTENCE AND QUALIFICATION; POWER; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.
Borrower is a corporation duly formed, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of Delaware.  Borrower is duly qualified or registered to
transact business and is in good standing in California and each other
jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership or leasing of
its Properties makes such qualification or registration necessary, EXCEPT where
the failure so to qualify or register and to be in good standing would not
constitute a Material Adverse Effect.  Borrower has all requisite corporate
power and authority to conduct its business, to own and lease its Properties and
to execute and deliver each Loan Document to which it is a Party and to perform
its Obligations.  The chief executive office of Borrower is located in
Garden Grove, California.  All outstanding shares of capital stock of Borrower
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and no
holder thereof has any enforceable right of rescission under any applicable
state or federal securities Laws.  Borrower is in compliance with all Laws and
other legal requirements applicable to its business, has obtained all
authorizations, consents, approvals, orders, licenses and permits from, and has
accomplished all filings, registrations and qualifications with, or obtained
exemptions from any of the foregoing from, any Governmental Agency that are
necessary for the transaction of its business, EXCEPT where the failure to so
comply, file, register, qualify or obtain exemptions does not constitute a
Material Adverse Effect.

            4.2  AUTHORITY; COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER AGREEMENTS AND INSTRUMENTS AND
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.  The execution, delivery and performance by Borrower and
each Subsidiary of Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is a Party have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not and will not:

                 (a)  Require any consent or approval not heretofore obtained of
       any partner, director, stockholder, security holder or creditor of such
       Party;

                 (b)  Violate or conflict with any provision of such Party's
       charter, certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws, as
       applicable;

                 (c)  Result in or require the creation or imposition of any
       Lien or Right of Others upon or with


                                      -56-

<PAGE>


       respect to any Property now owned or leased or hereafter acquired by such
       Party;

                 (d)  Violate any Requirement of Law applicable to such Party;

                 (e)  Result in a breach of or constitute a default under, or
       cause or permit the acceleration of any obligation owed under, any
       indenture or loan or credit agreement or any other Contractual Obligation
       to which such Party is a party or by which such Party or any of its
       Property is bound or affected;

and neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of, or default
under, any Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation, or any indenture, loan
or credit agreement described in Section 4.2(e), in any respect that constitutes
a Material Adverse Effect.

            4.3  NO GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS REQUIRED.  No authorization, consent,

       existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
       organization, is duly qualified to do business as a foreign organization

       compliance, obtain such authorizations, consents, approvals, orders,
       licenses, and permits, accomplish such filings, registrations, and
       qualifications, or obtain such exemptions, does not constitute a Material

            9.1  EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  The existence or occurrence of any one or

       respect that is materially adverse to the interests of the Banks, or (ii)
       Section 7.1(l) in any respect that is materially adverse to the interests
       of the Banks and which, as a consequence of such failure, results in the
       Banks being unable to reasonably protect their interests;

                 (e)  Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or any other Party fails
       to perform or observe any other covenant or agreement (not specified in

       the giving of notice by the Agent on behalf of the Requisite Banks of
       such Default; or

                 (f)  Any representation or warranty of Borrower or any of its

       principal, or any principal installment, of any present or future

       of $1,000,000 or more, on its part to be paid, when due (or within any
       stated grace period), whether at the stated maturity, upon acceleration,
       by reason of required prepayment or otherwise or (ii) fails to perform or
       observe any other term, covenant or agreement on its part to be performed
       or observed, or suffers any event to occur, in connection with any
       present or future Indebtedness of $1,000,000 or more, or of any guaranty
       of present or future Indebtedness of $1,000,000 or more, if as a result
       of such failure or sufferance any holder or holders thereof (or an agent

       Indebtedness due before the date on which it otherwise would become due;
       or

                 (h)  Any Loan Document, at any time after its execution and

       unsatisfied for thirty (30) calendar days after the date of entry of
       judgment, or in any event later than five (5) days prior to the date of
       any proposed sale thereunder; or any writ or warrant of attachment or
       execution or similar process is issued or levied against all or any
       material part of the Property of any such Person and is not released,
       vacated or fully bonded within thirty (30) calendar days after its issue
       or levy; or

                 (j)  (i) Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries institute or
       consent to the institution of any proceeding under a Debtor Relief Law

       Person and continues undismissed or unstayed for sixty (60) calendar
       days; or

                 (k)  The occurrence of an Event of Default (as such term is or
       may hereafter be specifically defined in any other Loan Document) under
       any other Loan Document; or

                 (l)  Any Pension Plan maintained by Borrower or any of its
       Subsidiaries is determined to have a material "accumulated funding
       deficiency" as that term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA and the
       result is a Material Adverse Effect.

            9.2  REMEDIES UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT.  Without limiting any other
rights or remedies of the Agent or the Banks provided for elsewhere in this
Agreement, or the other Loan Documents, or by applicable Law, or in equity, or
otherwise:

                 (a)  Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of any
       Event of Default OTHER THAN an Event of Default described in
       Section 9.1(j):

                 (1)  the Commitments and all other obligations of the Agent or
            the Banks under the Loan Documents shall be suspended without notice
            to or demand upon Borrower, which are expressly waived by Borrower,
            EXCEPT that all of the Banks or the Requisite Banks (as the case may
            be, in accordance with Section 11.2) may waive an Event of Default
            or, without waiving, determine, upon terms and conditions
            satisfactory to the Banks or Requisite Banks, as the case may be, to
            reinstate the Commitments and make further Advances, which waiver or
            determination shall apply equally to, and shall be binding upon, all
            the Banks;

                 (2)  the Issuing Bank may, with the approval of the Agent on
            behalf of the Requisite Banks, demand immediate payment by Borrower
            of an amount equal to the Aggregate Effective Amount of all
            outstanding Letters of Credit to be held by the Issuing Bank in an
            interest-bearing cash collateral account as collateral hereunder;
            and

                 (3)  the Requisite Banks may request the Agent to, and the
            Agent thereupon shall, terminate the Commitments and/or declare all
            or any part of the unpaid principal of all Notes, all interest
            accrued and unpaid thereon and all other Obligations payable


                                      -85-

<PAGE>


            under the Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon
            the same shall become and be forthwith due and payable, without
            protest, presentment, notice of dishonor, demand or further notice
            of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrower.

                 (b)  Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in
       Section 9.1(j):

                 (1)  the Commitments and all other obligations of the Agent or
            the Banks under the Loan Documents shall terminate without notice to
            or demand upon Borrower, which are expressly waived by Borrower,
            EXCEPT that all the Banks may waive the Event of Default or, without
            waiving, determine, upon terms and conditions satisfactory to all
            the Banks, to reinstate the Commitments and make further Advances,
            which determination shall apply equally to, and shall be binding
            upon, all the Banks;

                 (2)  an amount equal to the Aggregate Effective Amount of all
            outstanding Letters of Credit shall be immediately due and payable
            to the Issuing Bank without notice to or demand upon Borrower, which
            are expressly waived by Borrower, to be held by the Issuing Bank in
            an interest-bearing cash collateral account as collateral hereunder;
            and

                 (3)  the unpaid principal of all Notes, all interest accrued
            and unpaid thereon and all other amounts payable under the Loan
            Documents shall be forthwith due and payable, without protest,
            presentment, notice of dishonor, demand or further notice of any
            kind, all of which are expressly waived by Borrower.

                 (c)  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
       Event of Default, the Banks and the Agent, or any of them, without notice
       to (EXCEPT as expressly provided for in any Loan Document) or demand upon
       Borrower, which are expressly waived by Borrower (EXCEPT as to notices
       expressly provided for in any Loan Document), may proceed (but only with
       the consent of the Requisite Banks) to protect, exercise and enforce
       their rights and remedies under the Loan Documents against Borrower and
       any other Party and such other rights and remedies as are provided by Law
       or equity.

                 (d)  The order and manner in which the Banks' rights and
       remedies are to be exercised shall be determined by the Requisite Banks
       in their sole discretion, and


                                      -86-

<PAGE>


       all payments received by the Agent and the Banks, or any of them, shall
       be applied first to the costs and expenses (including reasonable
       attorneys' fees and disbursements and the reasonably allocated costs of
       attorneys employed by the Agent) of the Agent and of the Banks, and
       thereafter paid pro rata to the Banks in the same proportions that the
       aggregate Obligations owed to each Bank under the Loan Documents bear to
       the aggregate Obligations owed under the Loan Documents to all the Banks,
       without priority or preference among the Banks.  Regardless of how each
       Bank may treat payments for the purpose of its own accounting, for the
       purpose of computing Borrower's Obligations hereunder and under the
       Notes, payments shall be applied FIRST, to the costs and expenses of the
       Agent and the Banks, as set forth above, SECOND, to the payment of
       accrued and unpaid interest due under any Loan Documents to and including
       the date of such application (ratably, and without duplication, according
       to the accrued and unpaid interest due under each of the Loan Documents),
       and THIRD, to the payment of all other amounts (including principal and
       fees) then owing to the Agent or the Banks under the Loan Documents.  No
       application of payments will cure any Event of Default, or prevent
       acceleration, or continued acceleration, of amounts payable under the
       Loan Documents, or prevent the exercise, or continued exercise, of rights
       or remedies of the Banks hereunder or thereunder or at Law or in equity.

                                   Article 10
                                    THE AGENT


            10.1  APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION.  Subject to SECTION 10.8, each
Bank hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as
agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are
delegated to the Agent by the terms thereof or are reasonably incidental, as
determined by the Agent, thereto.  This appointment and authorization is
intended solely for the purpose of facilitating the servicing of the Loans and
does not constitute appointment of the Agent as trustee for any Bank or as
representative of any Bank for any other purpose and, EXCEPT as specifically set
forth in the Loan Documents to the contrary, the Agent shall take such action
and exercise such powers only in an administrative and ministerial capacity.

            10.2  AGENT AND AFFILIATES.  First Interstate Bank of California
(and each successor Agent) has the same rights and powers under the Loan
Documents as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Agent, and the term "Bank" or "Banks" includes First Interstate Bank of
California in its individual capacity.  First Interstate Bank of California (and
each successor Agent) and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to
and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with
Borrower, any Subsidiary thereof, or any Affiliate of Borrower or any Subsidiary
thereof, as if it were not the Agent and without any duty to account therefor to
the Banks.  First Interstate Bank of California (and each successor Agent) need
not account to any other Bank for any monies received by it for reimbursement of
its costs and expenses as Agent hereunder, or for any monies received by it in
its capacity as a Bank hereunder.  The Agent shall not be deemed to hold a
fiduciary relationship with any Bank and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Agent.

            10.3  PROPORTIONATE INTEREST IN ANY COLLATERAL.  The Agent, on
behalf of all the Banks, shall hold in accordance with the Loan Documents all
items of any collateral or interests therein received or held by the Agent.
Subject to the Agent's and the Banks' rights to reimbursement for their costs
and expenses hereunder (INCLUDING reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements
and other professional services and the reasonably allocated costs of attorneys
employed by the Agent or a Bank) and subject to the application of payments in
accordance with SECTION 9.2(d), each Bank shall have an interest in the Banks'
interest in the Collateral or interests therein in the same proportions that the
aggregate Obligations


                                      -88-

<PAGE>


owed such Bank under the Loan Documents bear to the aggregate Obligations owed
under the Loan Documents to all the Banks, without priority or preference among
the Banks, EXCEPT that Obligations owed to any Bank under a Secured Swap
Agreement shall be secured on a PARI PASSU basis with all other Obligations up
to an amount equal to the Agent's then customary credit risk factor for Swap
Agreements times the notional amount of Indebtedness covered by such Secured
Swap Agreement and shall be secured on a subordinate basis as to amounts in
excess of such amount.

            10.4  BANKS' CREDIT DECISIONS.  Each Bank agrees that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Bank or the
directors, officers, agents, employees or attorneys of the Agent or of any other
Bank, and instead in reliance upon information supplied to it by or on behalf of
Borrower and upon such other information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own independent credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each
Bank also agrees that it shall, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent, any other Bank or the directors, officers, agents, employees or attorneys
of the Agent or of any other Bank, continue to make its own independent credit
analyses and decisions in acting or not acting under the Loan Documents.

            10.5  ACTION BY AGENT.

                 (a)  The Agent may assume that no Default has occurred and is
       continuing, unless the Agent (or the Bank that is then the Agent) has
       received notice from Borrower stating the nature of the Default or has
       received notice from a Bank stating the nature of the Default and that
       such Bank considers the Default to have occurred and to be continuing.

                 (b)  The Agent has only those obligations under the Loan
       Documents as are expressly set forth therein.

                 (c)  EXCEPT for any obligation expressly set forth in the Loan
       Documents and as long as the Agent may assume that no Event of Default
       has occurred and is continuing, the Agent may, but shall not be required
       to, exercise its discretion to act or not act, EXCEPT that the Agent
       shall be required to act or not act upon the instructions of the
       Requisite Banks (or of all the Banks, to the extent required by
       SECTION 11.2) and those instructions shall be binding upon the Agent and
       all the Banks, PROVIDED that the Agent shall not be required to act or
       not act if to do so would be contrary to any Loan Document or to
       applicable Law or would result, in the reasonable judgment of the Agent,
       in substantial risk of liability to the Agent.


                                      -89-

<PAGE>


                 (d)  If the Agent has received a notice specified in clause
       (A), the Agent shall immediately give notice thereof to the Banks and
       shall act or not act upon the instructions of the Requisite Banks (or of
       all the Banks, to the extent required by SECTION 11.2), PROVIDED that the
       Agent shall not be required to act or not act if to do so would be
       contrary to any Loan Document or to applicable Law or would result, in
       the reasonable judgment of the Agent, in substantial risk of liability to
       the Agent, and EXCEPT that if the Requisite Banks (or all the Banks, if
       required under SECTION 11.2) fail, for five (5) Banking Days after the
       receipt of notice from the Agent, to instruct the Agent, then the Agent,
       in its sole discretion, may act or not act as it deems advisable for the
       protection of the interests of the Banks.

                 (e)  The Agent shall have no liability to any Bank for acting,
       or not acting, as instructed by the Requisite Banks (or all the Banks, if
       required under SECTION 11.2), notwithstanding any other provision hereof.

            10.6  LIABILITY OF AGENT.  Neither the Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, agents, employees or attorneys shall be liable for any
action taken or not taken by them under or in connection with the Loan
Documents, EXCEPT for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Without
limitation on the foregoing, the Agent and its directors, officers, agents,
employees and attorneys:

                 (a)  May treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof
       until the Agent receives notice of the assignment or transfer thereof, in
       form satisfactory to the Agent, signed by the payee, and may treat each
       Bank as the owner of that Bank's interest in the Obligations for all
       purposes of this Agreement until the Agent receives notice of the
       assignment or transfer thereof, in form satisfactory to the Agent, signed
       by that Bank.

                 (b)  May consult with legal counsel (INCLUDING in-house legal
       counsel), accountants (INCLUDING in-house accountants) and other
       professionals or experts selected by it, or with legal counsel,
       accountants or other professionals or experts for Borrower and/or its
       Subsidiaries or the Banks, and shall not be liable for any action taken
       or not taken by it in good faith in accordance with any advice of such
       legal counsel, accountants or other professionals or experts.

                 (c)  Shall not be responsible to any Bank for any statement,
       warranty or representation made in any of the Loan Documents or in any
       notice, certificate, report,


                                      -90-

<PAGE>


       request or other statement (written or oral) given or made in connection
       with any of the Loan Documents.

                 (d)  EXCEPT to the extent expressly set forth in the Loan
       Documents, shall have no duty to ask or inquire as to the performance or
       observance by Borrower or its Subsidiaries of any of the terms,
       conditions or covenants of any of the Loan Documents or to inspect any
       Collateral or the Property, books or records of Borrower or its
       Subsidiaries.

                 (e)  Will not be responsible to any Bank for the due execution,
       legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, effectiveness,
       sufficiency or value of any Loan Document, any other instrument or
       writing furnished pursuant thereto or in connection therewith, or any
       Collateral.

                 (f)  Will not incur any liability by acting or not acting in
       reliance upon any Loan Document, notice, consent, certificate, statement,
       request or other instrument or writing reasonably believed by it to be
       genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

                 (g)  Will not incur any liability for any arithmetical error in
       computing any amount paid or payable by the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
       Affiliate thereof or paid or payable to or received or receivable from
       any Bank under any Loan Document, INCLUDING, without limitation,
       principal, interest, commitment fees, Advances and other amounts;
       PROVIDED that, promptly upon discovery of such an error in computation,
       the Agent, the Banks and (to the extent applicable) Borrower and/or its
       Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall make such adjustments as are necessary
       to correct such error and to restore the parties to the position that
       they would have occupied had the error not occurred.

            10.7  INDEMNIFICATION.  Each Bank shall, ratably in accordance with
its Pro Rata Share of the Commitments, indemnify and hold the Agent and its
directors, officers, agents, employees and attorneys harmless against any and
all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(INCLUDING, without limitation, attorneys' fees and disbursements and allocated
costs of attorneys employed by the Agent) that may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against it or them in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents (other than losses incurred by reason of the failure of Borrower to
pay the Indebtedness represented by the Notes) or any action taken or not taken
by it as Agent thereunder, EXCEPT such as result from its own gross negligence


                                      -91-

<PAGE>


or willful misconduct.  Without limitation on the foregoing, each Bank shall
reimburse the Agent upon demand for that Bank's Pro Rata Share of any
out-of-pocket cost or expense incurred by the Agent in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery, amendment, waiver, restructuring,
reorganization (INCLUDING a bankruptcy reorganization), enforcement or attempted
enforcement of the Loan Documents, to the extent that Borrower or any other
Party is required by SECTION 11.3 to pay that cost or expense but fails to do so
upon demand.  Nothing in this SECTION 10.7 shall entitle the Agent to recover
any amount from the Banks if and to the extent that such amount has theretofore
been recovered from Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

            10.8  SUCCESSOR AGENT.  The Agent may, and at the request of the
Requisite Banks shall, resign as Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice to the
Banks and Borrower.  If the Agent shall resign as Agent under this Agreement,
the Requisite Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a successor Agent for the
Banks, which successor agent shall be approved by Borrower (and such approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  If no successor agent is
appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent
may appoint, after consulting with the Banks and the Borrower, a successor agent
from among the Banks.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent
hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor
agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be
terminated.  After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the
provisions of this ARTICLE 10, and Sections 11.3, 11.11 and 11.22, shall inure
to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Agent under this Agreement.  If (a) the Agent has not been paid its fees under
Section 3.3 or has not been reimbursed for any expense reimbursable to it under
Section 11.3, in either case for a period of at least one (1) year and (b) no
successor agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date which is thirty
(30) days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring
Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the
Requisite Banks (subject to the provisions specified in Section 11.2 requiring
consent of all the Banks) shall perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder
until such time, if any, as the Requisite Banks appoint a successor agent as
provided for above.

            10.9  NO OBLIGATIONS OF BORROWER.  Nothing contained in this
ARTICLE 10 shall be deemed to impose upon Borrower any obligation in respect of
the due and punctual performance by the Agent of its obligations to the Banks
under any provision of this Agreement, and Borrower shall have no liability to
the


                                      -92-

<PAGE>


Agent or any of the Banks in respect of any failure by the Agent or any Bank to
perform any of its obligations to the Agent or the Banks under this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, where any provision of this
Agreement relating to the payment of any amounts due and owing or the delivery
of documents under the Loan Documents provides that such payments shall be made
or documents delivered by Borrower to the Agent for the account of the Banks,
Borrower's obligations to the Banks in respect of such payments and documents
shall be deemed to be satisfied upon the making of such payments or delivery of
such documents to the Agent in the manner provided by this Agreement.

                                   Article 11
                                  MISCELLANEOUS


            11.1  CUMULATIVE REMEDIES; NO WAIVER.  The rights, powers,
privileges and remedies of the Agent and the Banks provided herein or in any
Note or other Loan Document are cumulative and not exclusive of any right,
power, privilege or remedy provided by Law or equity.  No failure or delay on
the part of the Agent or any Bank in exercising any right, power, privilege or
remedy may be, or may be deemed to be, a waiver thereof; nor may any single or
partial exercise of any right, power, privilege or remedy preclude any other or
further exercise of the same or any other right, power, privilege or remedy.
The terms and conditions of ARTICLE 8 hereof are inserted for the sole benefit
of the Agent and the Banks; the same may be waived in whole or in part, with or
without terms or conditions, in respect of any Loan without prejudicing the
Agent's or the Banks' rights to assert them in whole or in part in respect of
any other Loan.

            11.2  AMENDMENTS; CONSENTS.  No amendment, modification, supplement,
extension, termination or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, no approval or consent thereunder, and no consent to any
departure by the Borrower or any other Party therefrom, may in any event be
effective unless in writing signed by the Requisite Banks or by the Agent with
the written approval of the Requisite Banks (and, in the case of any amendment,
modification or supplement of or to any Loan Document to which any Borrower is a
Party, signed by Borrower and, in the case of any amendment, modification or
supplement to ARTICLE 10, signed by the Agent), and then only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose given; and, without the approval in
writing of all the Banks, no amendment, modification, supplement, termination,
waiver or consent may be effective:

                 (a)  To amend or modify the principal of, or the amount of
       principal, principal prepayments or the rate of interest payable on, any
       Note, or the amount of the Commitments or the Pro Rata Share of any Bank
       (except as otherwise provided in Section 11.8) or the amount of any
       commitment fee payable to any Bank, or any other fee or amount payable to
       any Bank under the Loan Documents or to waive an Event of Default
       consisting of the failure of Borrower to pay when due principal, interest
       or any commitment fee;

                 (b)  To postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal
       of, prepayment of principal of or any installment of interest on, any
       Note or any installment of any


                                      -94-

<PAGE>


       commitment fee, or to extend the term of the Commitments, or to release
       the Subsidiary Guaranty;

                 (c)  to release any material portion of the Collateral (EXCEPT
       as otherwise expressly provided in any Loan Document);

                 (d)  To amend the provisions of the definition of "REQUISITE
       BANKS", ARTICLES 8 OR 9 or this SECTION 11.2 or to amend or waive
       SECTION 6.4; or

                 (e)  To amend any provision of this Agreement that expressly
       requires the consent or approval of all the Banks.

Any amendment, modification, supplement, termination, waiver or consent pursuant
to this SECTION 11.2 shall apply equally to, and shall be binding upon, all the
Banks and the Agent.

            11.3  COSTS, EXPENSES AND TAXES.  Borrower shall pay within five (5)
Banking Days after demand, accompanied by an invoice therefor, the reasonable
costs and expenses of the Agent in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
syndication, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and any amendment
thereto or waiver thereof.  Borrower shall also pay on demand, accompanied by an
invoice therefor, the reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent and the Banks
in connection with the refinancing, restructuring, reorganization (INCLUDING a
bankruptcy reorganization) and enforcement or attempted enforcement of the Loan
Documents, and any matter related thereto.  The foregoing costs and expenses
shall include filing fees, recording fees, title insurance fees, appraisal fees,
search fees, and other out-of-pocket expenses and the reasonable fees and out-
of-pocket expenses of any legal counsel (INCLUDING reasonably allocated costs of
legal counsel employed by the Agent or any Bank), independent public accountants
and other outside experts retained by the Agent or any Bank, whether or not such
costs and expenses are incurred or suffered by the Agent or any Bank in
connection with or during the course of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings
of Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof.  Such costs and expenses shall also
include, in the case of any amendment or waiver of any Loan Document requested
by Borrower, the administrative costs of the Agent reasonably attributable
thereto.  Borrower shall pay any and all documentary and other taxes, EXCLUDING
Excluded Taxes, and all costs, expenses, fees and charges payable or determined
to be payable in connection with the filing or recording of this Agreement, any
other Loan Document or any other instrument or writing to be delivered hereunder
or thereunder, or in connection with any transaction pursuant hereto or thereto,
and shall reimburse, hold harmless and indemnify the Agent and the Banks from
and against any and all loss, liability or legal or


                                      -95-

<PAGE>


other expense with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or failure
to pay any such tax, cost, expense, fee or charge or that any of them may suffer
or incur by reason of the failure of any Party to perform any of its
Obligations.  Any amount payable to the Agent or any Bank under this
SECTION 11.3 shall bear interest from the second Banking Day following the date
of demand for payment at the Default Rate, EXCEPT that any such amount payable
under the first sentence of this SECTION 11.3 shall bear such interest from the
sixth (6th) Banking Day following the date of demand for payment.

            11.4  NATURE OF BANKS' OBLIGATIONS.  The obligations of the Banks
hereunder are several and not joint or joint and several.  Nothing contained in
this Agreement or any other Loan Document and no action taken by the Agent or
the Banks or any of them pursuant hereto or thereto may, or may be deemed to,
make the Banks a partnership, an association, a joint venture or other entity,
either among themselves or with Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower.  Each
Bank's obligation to make any Advance pursuant hereto is several and not joint
or joint and several, and in the case of the initial Advance only is conditioned
upon the performance by all other Banks of their obligations to make initial
Advances.  A default by any Bank will not increase the Pro Rata Share of the
Commitments attributable to any other Bank.  Any Bank not in default may, if it
desires, assume in such proportion as the nondefaulting Banks agree the
obligations of any Bank in default, but is not obligated to do so.  The Agent
agrees that it will use its best efforts either to induce the other Banks to
assume the obligations of a Bank in default or to obtain another Bank,
reasonably satisfactory to Borrower, to replace such a Bank in default.

            11.5  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  All
representations and warranties contained herein or in any other Loan Document,
or in any certificate or other writing delivered by or on behalf of any one or
more of the Parties to any Loan Document, will survive the making of the Loans
hereunder and the execution and delivery of the Notes, and have been or will be
relied upon by the Agent and each Bank, notwithstanding any investigation made
by the Agent or any Bank or on their behalf.

            11.6  NOTICES.  EXCEPT as otherwise expressly provided in the Loan
Documents, all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications
provided for hereunder or under any other Loan Document must be in writing and
must be mailed, telegraphed, telecopied, dispatched by commercial courier or
delivered to the appropriate party at the address set forth on the signature
pages of this Agreement or other applicable Loan Document or, as to any party to
any Loan Document, at any other address as may be designated by it in a


                                      -96-

<PAGE>


written notice sent to all other parties to such Loan Document in accordance
with this SECTION 11.6.  EXCEPT as otherwise expressly provided in any Loan
Document, if any notice, request, demand, direction or other communication
required or permitted by any Loan Document is given by mail it will be effective
on the earlier of receipt or the third calendar day after deposit in the United
States mail with first class or airmail postage prepaid; if given by telegraph
or cable, when delivered to the telegraph company with charges prepaid; if given
by telecopier during regular business hours of the recipient, when sent; if
given by telecopier outside regular business hours of the recipient, at the
opening of business on the next business day; if dispatched by commercial
courier, on the scheduled delivery date; or if given by personal delivery, when
delivered.

            11.7  EXECUTION OF LOAN DOCUMENTS.  Unless the Agent otherwise
specifies with respect to any Loan Document, (a) this Agreement and any other
Loan Document may be executed in any number of counterparts and any party hereto
or thereto may execute any counterpart, each of which when executed and
delivered will be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, as the case may be, when taken together
will be deemed to be but one and the same instrument and (b) execution of any
such counterpart may be evidenced by a telecopier transmission of the signature
of such party.  The execution of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by
any party hereto or thereto will not become effective until counterparts hereof
or thereof, as the case may be, have been executed by all the parties hereto or
thereto.

            11.8  BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT.

            (a)  Subject to the provisions of this SECTION 11.8, this Agreement
       and the other Loan Documents to which Borrower is a Party will be binding
       upon and inure to the benefit of Borrower, the Agent, each of the Banks,
       and their respective successors and assigns, EXCEPT that Borrower may not
       assign its rights hereunder or thereunder or any interest herein or
       therein without the prior written consent of all the Banks.  Each Bank
       represents that it is not acquiring its Note with a view to the
       distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as
       amended (subject to any requirement that disposition of such Note must be
       within the control of such Bank).  Any Bank may at any time pledge its
       Note or any other instrument evidencing its rights as a Bank under this
       Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank, but no such pledge shall release
       that Bank from its obligations hereunder or grant to such Federal Reserve
       Bank the rights of a Bank hereunder absent foreclosure of such pledge.


                                      -97-

<PAGE>


            (b)  From time to time following the Closing Date, each Bank may
       assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or any portion of its Pro
       Rata Share of the Commitments; PROVIDED that (i) such Eligible Assignee,
       if not then a Bank or an Affiliate of the assigning Bank, shall be
       approved by each of the Agent and Borrower (neither of which approvals
       shall be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii) such assignment shall be
       evidenced by a Commitment Assignment and Acceptance, a copy of which
       shall be furnished to the Agent as hereinbelow provided, (iii) EXCEPT in
       the case of an assignment to an Affiliate of the assigning Bank, to
       another Bank or of the entire remaining Commitment of the assigning Bank,
       the assignment shall not assign a Pro Rata Share of the Commitments
       equivalent to less than $10,000,000, (iv) the assignment shall assign the
       same Pro Rata Share of the Line A Commitment and the Line B Commitment,
       (v) such assignment shall not subject Borrower (solely as a consequence
       of the assignment) to any additional costs, expenses, liabilities, taxes,
       assessments or other charges under SECTIONS 3.6, 3.7 or 3.9(d) and
       (vi) the effective date of any such assignment shall be as specified in
       the Commitment Assignment and Acceptance, but not earlier than the date
       which is three (3) Banking Days after the date the Agent has received the
       Commitment Assignment and Acceptance.  Upon the effective date of such
       Commitment Assignment and Acceptance, the Eligible Assignee named therein
       shall be a Bank for all purposes of this Agreement, with the Pro Rata
       Share of the Commitments therein set forth and, to the extent of such Pro
       Rata Share, the assigning Bank shall be released from its further
       obligations under this Agreement.  Borrower agrees that it shall execute
       and deliver (against delivery by the assigning Bank to Borrower of such
       Bank's Note) to such assignee Bank, Notes evidencing that assignee Bank's
       Pro Rata Share of the Commitments, and to the assigning Bank,  Notes
       evidencing the remaining balance Pro Rata Share retained by the assigning
       Bank.

            (c)  By executing and delivering a Commitment Assignment and
       Acceptance, the Eligible Assignee thereunder acknowledges and agrees
       that: (i) other than the representation and warranty that it is the legal
       and beneficial owner of the Pro Rata Share of the Commitments being
       assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim, the assigning Bank
       has made no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
       respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in
       connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity,
       enforceability, genuineness or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other
       Loan Document; (ii) the assigning Bank has made no representation or
       warranty and


                                      -98-

<PAGE>


       assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of
       Borrower or the performance by Borrower of the Obligations; (iii) it has
       received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the most
       recent financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 7.1 and such
       other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its
       own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Commitment Assignment
       and Acceptance; (iv) it will, independently and without reliance upon the
       Agent or any Bank and based on such documents and information as it shall
       deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions
       in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) it appoints and
       authorizes the Agent to take such action and to exercise such powers
       under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by this Agreement; and
       (vi) it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the
       obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be
       performed by it as a Bank.

                 (d)  The Agent shall maintain at the Agent's Office a copy of
       each Commitment Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it.  After receipt
       of a completed Commitment Assignment and Acceptance executed by any Bank
       and an Eligible Assignee, and receipt of an assignment fee of $2,500 from
       such Eligible Assignee, the Agent shall, promptly following the effective
       date thereof, provide to Borrower and the Banks a revised SCHEDULE 1.1
       giving effect thereto.

                 (e)  Any Bank may from time to time grant participations to one
       or more banks or other financial institutions (INCLUDING another Bank) in
       a portion of its Pro Rata Share of the Commitments; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
       that (i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
       unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other
       parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the
       participating banks or other financial institutions shall not be a Bank
       hereunder for any purpose EXCEPT, if the participation agreement so
       provides, for the purposes of SECTIONS 3.6, 3.7, 11.11 and 11.22 but only
       to the extent that the cost of such benefits to Borrower does not exceed
       the cost which Borrower would have incurred in respect of such Bank
       absent the participation, (iv) Borrower, the Agent and the other Banks
       shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection
       with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v) the
       participation interest shall be expressed as a percentage of the granting
       Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Commitments as it then exists and shall not
       restrict an increase in the Commitments, or in the granting Bank's Pro
       Rata Share of



                                      -99-

<PAGE>


       the Commitments, so long as the amount of the participation interest is
       not affected thereby and (vi) the consent of the holder of such
       participation interest shall not be required for amendments or waivers of
       provisions of the Loan Documents OTHER THAN those which (A) extend the
       Line A Maturity Date, Line B Maturity Date or any other date upon which
       any payment of money is due to the Banks, (B) reduce the rate of interest
       on the Notes, any fee or any other monetary amount payable to the Banks,
       (C) reduce the amount of any installment of principal due under the
       Notes, (D) change the definition of "Requisite Banks" or (E) release any
       material portion of the Collateral.

            11.9  RIGHT OF SETOFF.  If an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Agent or any Bank (but only with the consent of the Requisite
Banks) may exercise its rights under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code
and other applicable Laws and, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, apply
any funds in any deposit account maintained with it by Borrower and/or any
Property of Borrower in its possession against the Obligations.

            11.10  SHARING OF SETOFFS.  Each Bank severally agrees that if it,
through the exercise of any right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim
against Borrower, or otherwise, receives payment of the Obligations held by it
that is ratably more than any other Bank, through any means, receives in payment
of the Obligations held by that Bank, then, subject to applicable Laws:  (a) the
Bank exercising the right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or otherwise
receiving such payment shall purchase, and shall be deemed to have
simultaneously purchased, from the other Bank a participation in the Obligations
held by the other Bank and shall pay to the other Bank a purchase price in an
amount so that the share of the Obligations held by each Bank after the exercise
of the right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or receipt of payment
shall be in the same proportion that existed prior to the exercise of the right
of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim or receipt of payment; and (b) such
other adjustments and purchases of participations shall be made from time to
time as shall be equitable to ensure that all of the Banks share any payment
obtained in respect of the Obligations ratably in accordance with each Bank's
share of the Obligations immediately prior to, and without taking into account,
the payment; PROVIDED that, if all or any portion of a disproportionate payment
obtained as a result of the exercise of the right of setoff, banker's lien,
counterclaim or otherwise is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Bank by
Borrower or any Person claiming through or succeeding to the rights of Borrower,
the purchase of a participation shall be rescinded and the purchase price
thereof shall be restored to the extent of the recovery, but without interest.
Each Bank that purchases a participation


                                      -100-

in the Obligations pursuant to this Section 11.10 shall from and after the
purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and
other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the
Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Bank were the
original owner of the Obligations purchased.  Borrower expressly consents to the
foregoing arrangements and agree that any Bank holding a participation in an
Obligation so purchased may exercise any and all rights of setoff, banker's lien
or counterclaim with respect to the participation as fully as if the Bank were
the original owner of the Obligation purchased.

            11.11  INDEMNITY BY BORROWER.  Borrower agrees to indemnify, save
and hold harmless the Agent and each Bank and their directors, officers, agents,
attorneys and employees (collectively the "INDEMNITEES") from and against:
(a) any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action arising out of or
relating to any act or omission (or alleged act or omission) of Borrower, its
Affiliates or any of its officers, directors or stockholders relating to the
Commitment, the use or contemplated use of proceeds of any Loan, or the
relationship of Borrower and the Banks under this Agreement; (b) any
administrative or investigative proceeding by any Governmental Agency arising
out of or related to a claim, demand, action or cause of action described in
clause (a) above; and (c) any and all liabilities, losses, costs or expenses
(INCLUDING reasonable attorneys' fees and the reasonably allocated costs of
attorneys employed by any Indemnitee and disbursements of such attorneys and
other professional services) that any Indemnitee suffers or incurs as a result
of the assertion of any foregoing claim, demand, action or cause of action;
PROVIDED that no Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any of the
foregoing caused by its own gross negligence or willful misconduct or breach of
any of its obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or for
any of the foregoing asserted against it by another Indemnitee.  If any claim,
demand, action or cause of action is asserted against any Indemnitee, such
Indemnitee shall promptly notify Borrower, but the failure to so promptly notify
Borrower shall not affect Borrower's obligations under this Section unless such
failure materially prejudices Borrower's right to participate in the contest of
such claim, demand, action or cause of action, as hereinafter provided.  Such
Indemnitee may (and shall, if requested by Borrower in writing) contest the
validity, applicability and amount of such claim, demand, action or cause of
action and shall permit Borrower to participate in such contest.  Any Indemnitee
that proposes to settle or compromise any claim or proceeding for which Borrower
may be liable for payment of indemnity hereunder shall give Borrower written
notice of the terms of such proposed settlement or compromise reasonably in
advance of settling or compromising such claim or proceeding and shall obtain
Borrower's prior consent (which shall not be


                                      -101-

<PAGE>


unreasonably withheld or delayed).  In connection with any claim, demand, action
or cause of action covered by this Section 11.11 against more than one
Indemnitee, all such Indemnitees shall be represented by the same legal counsel
(which may be a law firm engaged by the Indemnitees or attorneys employed by an
Indemnitee or a combination of the foregoing) selected by the Indemnitees and
reasonably acceptable to Borrower; PROVIDED, that if such legal counsel
determines in good faith that representing all such Indemnitees would or could
result in a conflict of interest under Laws or ethical principles applicable to
such legal counsel or that a defense or counterclaim is available to an
Indemnitee that is not available to all such Indemnitees, then to the extent
reasonably necessary to avoid such a conflict of interest or to permit
unqualified assertion of such a defense or counterclaim, each Indemnitee shall
be entitled to separate representation by legal counsel selected by that
Indemnitee and reasonably acceptable to Borrower, with all such legal counsel
using reasonable efforts to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort by counsel
for all Indemnitees; and FURTHER PROVIDED that the Agent (as an Indemnitee)
shall at all times be entitled to representation by separate legal counsel
(which may be a law firm or attorneys employed by the Agent or a combination of
the foregoing).  Any obligation or liability of Borrower to any Indemnitee under
this Section 11.11 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement
and the repayment of all Loans and the payment and performance of all other
Obligations owed to the Banks.

            11.12  NONLIABILITY OF THE BANKS.  Borrower acknowledges and agrees
that:

                 (a)  Any inspections of any Property of Borrower made by or
       through the Agent or the Banks are for purposes of administration of the
       Loan only and Borrower is not entitled to rely upon the same (whether or
       not such inspections are at the expense of Borrower);

                 (b)  By accepting or approving anything required to be
       observed, performed, fulfilled or given to the Agent or the Banks
       pursuant to the Loan Documents, neither the Agent nor the Banks shall be
       deemed to have warranted or represented the sufficiency, legality,
       effectiveness or legal effect of the same, or of any term, provision or
       condition thereof, and such acceptance or approval thereof shall not
       constitute a warranty or representation to anyone with respect thereto by
       the Agent or the Banks;

                 (c)  The relationship between Borrower and the Agent and the
       Banks is, and shall at all times remain, solely that of borrower and
       lenders; neither the Agent nor the Banks shall under any circumstance be
       construed to be


                                      -102-

<PAGE>


       partners or joint venturers of Borrower or its Affiliates; neither the
       Agent nor the Banks shall under any circumstance be deemed to be in a
       relationship of confidence or trust or a fiduciary relationship with
       Borrower or its Affiliates, or to owe any fiduciary duty to Borrower or
       its Affiliates; neither the Agent nor the Banks undertake or assume any
       responsibility or duty to Borrower or its Affiliates to select, review,
       inspect, supervise, pass judgment upon or inform Borrower or its
       Affiliates of any matter in connection with their Property or the
       operations of Borrower or its Affiliates; Borrower and its Affiliates
       shall rely entirely upon their own judgment with respect to such matters;
       and any review, inspection, supervision, exercise of judgment or supply
       of information undertaken or assumed by the Agent or the Banks in
       connection with such matters is solely for the protection of the Agent
       and the Banks and neither Borrower nor any other Person is entitled to
       rely thereon; and

                 (d)  The Agent and the Banks shall not be responsible or liable
       to any Person for any loss, damage, liability or claim of any kind
       relating to injury or death to Persons or damage to Property caused by
       the actions, inaction or negligence of Borrower and/or its Affiliates and
       Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds the Agent and the Banks harmless
       from any such loss, damage, liability or claim.

            11.13  NO THIRD PARTIES BENEFITED.  This Agreement is made for the
purpose of defining and setting forth certain obligations, rights and duties of
Borrower, the Agent and the Banks in connection with the Loans, and is made for
the sole benefit of Borrower, the Agent and the Banks, and the Agent's and the
Banks' successors and assigns.  EXCEPT as provided in Sections 11.8 and 11.11,
no other Person shall have any rights of any nature hereunder or by reason
hereof.

            11.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.  Each Bank agrees to hold any confidential
information that it may receive from Borrower pursuant to this Agreement in
confidence, EXCEPT for disclosure:  (a) to other Banks; (b) to legal counsel and
accountants for Borrower or any Bank; (c) to other professional advisors to
Borrower or any Bank, provided that the recipient has been informed in advance
of the confidential nature of such information; (d) to regulatory officials
having jurisdiction over that Bank; (e) as required by Law or legal process or
in connection with any legal proceeding or litigation involving that Bank and
Borrower; and (f) to another financial institution in connection with a
disposition or proposed disposition to that financial institution of all or part
of that Bank's interests hereunder or a participation interest in its Note,
provided that the recipient has been informed in


                                      -103-

<PAGE>


advance of the confidential nature of such information.  For purposes of the
foregoing, "confidential information" shall mean any information respecting
Borrower or its Subsidiaries reasonably considered by Borrower to be
confidential, OTHER THAN (i) information previously filed with any Governmental
Agency and available to the public, (ii) information previously published in any
public medium from a source other than, directly or indirectly, that Bank, and
(iii) information previously disclosed by Borrower to any Person not associated
with Borrower without a confidentiality agreement or obligation substantially
similar to this Section 11.14.  Nothing in this Section shall be construed to
create or give rise to any fiduciary duty on the part of the Agent or the Banks
to Borrower.

            11.15  FURTHER ASSURANCES.  Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall, at
their expense and without expense to the Banks or the Agent, do, execute and
deliver such further acts and documents as any Bank or the Agent from time to
time reasonably requires for the assuring and confirming unto the Banks or the
Agent of the rights hereby created or intended now or hereafter so to be, or for
carrying out the intention or facilitating the performance of the terms of any
Loan Document.

            11.16  INTEGRATION.  This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, on
the subject matter hereof.  In the event of any conflict between the provisions
of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this
Agreement shall control and govern; PROVIDED that the inclusion of supplemental
rights or remedies in favor of the Agent or the Banks in any other Loan Document
shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement.  Each Loan Document was
drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall
be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance
with the fair meaning thereof.

            11.17  GOVERNING LAW.  EXCEPT to the extent otherwise provided
therein, each Loan Document shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in
accordance with, the local Laws of California.

            11.18  SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS.  Any provision in any Loan
Document that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable or invalid as to any
party or in any jurisdiction shall, as to that party or jurisdiction, be
inoperative, unenforceable or invalid without affecting the remaining provisions
or the operation, enforceability or validity of that provision as to any other
party or in any other jurisdiction, and to this end


                                      -104-

<PAGE>


the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable.

            11.19  HEADINGS.  Article and Section headings in this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents are included for convenience of reference only and are
not part of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents for any other purpose.

            11.20  TIME OF THE ESSENCE.  Time is of the essence of the Loan
Documents.

            11.21  FOREIGN BANKS AND PARTICIPANTS.  Each Bank, and each holder
of a participation interest herein, that is incorporated or otherwise organized
under the Laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States of America or any
State thereof or the District of Columbia shall deliver to Borrower (with a copy
to the Agent), within twenty (20) days after the Closing Date (or after
accepting an assignment or receiving a participation interest herein pursuant to
Section 11.8, if applicable) two duly completed copies, signed by a Responsible
Official, of either Form 1001 (relating to such Person and entitling it to a
complete exemption from withholding on all payments to be made to such Person by
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or Form 4224 (relating to all payments to
be made to such Person by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) of the United
States Internal Revenue Service or such other evidence (INCLUDING, if reasonably
necessary, Form W-9) satisfactory to Borrower and the Agent that no withholding
under the federal income tax laws is required with respect to such Person.
Thereafter and from time to time, each such Person shall (a) promptly submit to
Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), such additional duly completed and signed
copies of one of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from
time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be
available under then current United States laws and regulations to avoid, or
such evidence as is satisfactory to Borrower and the Agent of any available
exemption from, United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be
made to such Person by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement and (b) take such
steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable
judgment of such Bank, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the
re-designation of its Eurodollar Lending Office, if any) to avoid any
requirement of applicable Laws that Borrower makes any deduction or withholding
for taxes from amounts payable to such Person.  Unless and until Borrower and
the Agent have received such forms and other documents described in this Section
11.21 reasonably satisfactory to them establishing that each Bank is entitled to
receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
United States Federal income taxes, Borrower or the Agent (if not withheld by
Borrower) shall withhold taxes from such payment at the applic-


                                      -105-

<PAGE>


able statutory rate, without any obligation to "gross-up" or increase amounts
payable hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents.

            11.22  HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INDEMNITY.  Borrower hereby agrees to
indemnify, hold harmless and defend (by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Agent) the Agent and each of the Banks and their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims,
losses, damages, liabilities, fines, penalties, charges, administrative and
judicial proceedings and orders, judgments, remedial action requirements,
enforcement actions of any kind, and all costs and expenses incurred in
connection therewith (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees
and the reasonably allocated costs of attorneys employed by the Agent or any
Bank, and expenses to the extent that the defense of any such action has not
been assumed by Borrower), arising directly or indirectly out of (i) the
presence on, in, under or about any Real Property of any Hazardous Materials, or
any releases or discharges of any Hazardous Materials on, under or from any Real
Property and (ii) any activity carried on or undertaken on or off any Real
Property by Borrower or any of its predecessors in title, whether prior to or
during the term of this Agreement, and whether by Borrower or any predecessor in
title or any employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors of Borrower or any
predecessor in title, or any third persons at any time occupying or present on
any Real Property, in connection with the handling, treatment, removal, storage,
decontamination, clean-up, transport or disposal of any Hazardous Materials at
any time located or present on, in, under or about any Real Property.  The
foregoing indemnity shall further apply to any residual contamination on, in,
under or about any Real Property, or affecting any natural resources, and to any
contamination of any Property or natural resources arising in connection with
the generation, use, handling, storage, transport or disposal of any such
Hazardous Materials, and irrespective of whether any of such activities were or
will be undertaken in accordance with applicable Laws, but the foregoing
indemnity shall not apply to Hazardous Materials in, on, under or about any Real
Property or any other Property, the presence of which is caused by the Agent or
the Banks or any of their respective employees, agents, contractors or
subcontractors.  Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to the
contrary, the obligations of Borrower under this Section (and under
Sections 4.18 and 5.12) shall be unlimited corporate obligations of Borrower and
shall NOT be secured by any deed of trust on any Real Property.

       11.23  ARBITRATION REFERENCE.

            (a)  BINDING ARBITRATION.   Upon the written demand of any  party
("Loan Party/Loan Parties"), to a Document (as defined below), whether made
before the institution of any judicial proceeding or not more than 60 days after
service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross-claim or counterclaim or
any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above, any Dispute (as defined
below) shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the terms of
this arbitration program ("Arbitration Program").  A "Dispute" shall include any
action, dispute, claim or controversy of any kind, whether founded in contract,
tort, statutory or common law, equity, or otherwise, now existing or hereafter
arising between any of the Loan Parties arising out of, pertaining to or in
connection with any agreement, document or instrument to which this Arbitration
Program is attached or in which it appears or is referenced or any related
agreements, documents, or instruments ("Documents").  Any Loan Party who fails
to submit to binding arbitration following a lawful demand by another Loan Party
shall bear all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees
(including those incurred in any trial, bankruptcy proceeding or on appeal),
incurred by the other Loan Party in obtaining a stay of any pending judicial
proceeding and compelling arbitration of any Dispute.  The Loan Parties agree
that any agreement, document or instrument which includes, attaches to or
incorporates this Arbitration Program represents a transaction involving
commerce as that term is used in the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 United
States Code ("FAA").  THE LOAN PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS AGREEMENT THEY
HAVE DECIDED THAT THEIR DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER
THAN IN COURT, AND ONCE DECIDED BY ARBITRATION NO DISPUTE CAN LATER BE BROUGHT,
FILED OR PURSUED IN COURT.

            (b)  GOVERNING RULES.  Arbitrations conducted pursuant to this
Arbitration Program shall be administered by the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA"), or other mutually agreeable administrator ("Administrator")
in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Program and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the AAA.  Proceedings hereunder shall be governed by the
provisions of the FAA.  The arbitrator(s) shall resolve all Disputes in
accordance with the applicable substantive law designated in the Documents.
Judgment upon any award rendered hereunder may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing herein shall be construed to be a
waiver by any Loan Party that is a bank of the protections afforded pursuant to
12 U.S.C. 91 or any similar applicable state law.


                                      -107-

<PAGE>


            (c)  ARBITRATOR POWERS AND QUALIFICATIONS; AWARDS.  The Loan Parties
agree to select a neutral qualified arbitrator or a panel of three qualified
arbitrators to resolve any Dispute hereunder.  "Qualified" means a retired judge
or practicing attorney, with not less than 10 years practice in commercial law,
licensed to practice in the state of the applicable substantive law designated
in the Documents.  A Dispute in which the claims or amounts in controversy do
not exceed $1,000,000, shall be decided by a single arbitrator.  A single
arbitrator shall have authority to render an award up to but not to exceed
$1,000,000.00 including all damages of any kind whatsoever, costs, fees,
attorneys' fees and expenses.  Submission to a single arbitrator shall be a
waiver of all Loan Parties' claims to recover more than $1,000,000.00.  A
Dispute involving claims or amounts in controversy exceeding $1,000,000.00 shall
be decided by a majority vote of a panel of three qualified arbitrators.  All
three arbitrators on the arbitration panel must actively participate in all
hearings and deliberations.  The arbitrator(s) shall be empowered to, at the
written request of any Loan Party in any Dispute, 1) to consolidate in a single
proceeding any multiple party claims that are substantially identical or based
upon the same underlying transaction; 2) to consolidate any claims and Disputes
between other Loan Parties which arise out of or relate to the subject matter
hereof, including all claims by or against borrowers, guarantors, sureties
and/or owners of collateral; and 3) to administer multiple arbitration claims as
class actions in accordance with Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure.  In any consolidated proceeding the first arbitrator(s) selected in
any proceeding shall conduct the consolidated proceeding unless disqualified due
to conflict of interest.  The arbitrators(s) shall be empowered to resolve any
dispute regarding the terms of this arbitration clause, including questions
about the arbitrability of any Dispute, but shall have no power to change or
alter the terms of the Arbitration Program.  The prevailing Loan Party in any
Dispute shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees in any
arbitration, and the arbitrator(s) shall have the power to award such fees.  The
award of the arbitrator(s) shall be in writing and shall set forth the factual
and legal basis for the award.

            (d)  REAL PROPERTY COLLATERAL.  Notwithstanding the provisions of
subparagraphs (a) through (c), no Dispute shall be submitted to arbitration
without the consent of all Loan Parties if, at the time of the proposed
submission, such Dispute arises from or relates to an obligation which is
secured directly or indirectly and in whole or in part by real property
collateral.  If all Loan Parties do not consent to submission of such a Dispute
to arbitration, the Dispute shall be determined as provided in subparagraph (e)
below.


                                      -108-

<PAGE>


            (e)  JUDICIAL REFERENCE.  At the request of any Loan Party, a
Dispute which is not submitted to arbitration as provided and limited in
subparagraphs (a) through (d) above shall be determined by a reference in
accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure Section 638 et seq.  If such
an election is made, the Loan Parties shall designate to the court a referee or
referees selected under the auspices of the AAA, unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by all parties.  With respect to a Dispute in which the amounts in
controversy do not exceed $1,000,000, a single referee shall be chosen and shall
resolve the Dispute.  The referee shall have authority to render an award up to
but not to exceed $1,000,000, including all damages of any kind whatsoever,
including costs, fees, attorneys' fees and expenses.  A Dispute involving
amounts in controversy exceeding $1,000,000 shall be decided by a majority vote
of a panel of three referees (a "Referee Panel"), PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that all
three referees on the Referee Panel must actively participate in all hearings
and deliberations.  Referees, including any Referee Panel, may grant any remedy
of relief deemed just and equitable and within the scope of this Arbitration
Program and may also grant such ancillary relief as is necessary to make
effective any award.  The presiding referee of the Referee Panel, or the referee
if there is a single referee, shall be a retired judge.  Judgment upon the award
rendered by such referee(s) shall be entered in the court in which such
proceeding was commenced in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure
Sections 644 and 645.  Determinations and awards by a referee or Referee Panel
shall be binding on all Loan Parties and shall not be subject to further review
or appeal except as allowed by applicable Law.

            (f)  PRESERVATION OF REMEDIES.  No provision of, nor the exercise of
any rights under, this Arbitration Program shall limit the right of any Loan
Party to:  (1) foreclose against and/or sale of any real or personal property
collateral or other security, or obtain a personal or deficiency award;
(2) exercise self-help remedies (including repossession and setoff rights); or
(3) obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as injunctive relief,
sequestration, attachment, replevin, garnishment, or the appointment of a
receiver from a court having jurisdiction.  Such rights can be exercised at any
time except to the extent such action is contrary to a final award or decision
in any arbitration proceeding.  The institution and maintenance of an action as
described above shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any Loan Party to
submit the Dispute to arbitration, nor render inapplicable the compulsory
arbitration provisions hereof.  Any claim or dispute related to the exercise of
any self-help, auxiliary or other rights under this paragraph shall be a Dispute
hereunder.

            (g)  MISCELLANEOUS.  All statutes of limitation applicable to any
Dispute shall apply to any proceeding in


                                      -109-

<PAGE>


accordance with this Arbitration Program.  The Loan Parties agree, to the
maximum extent practicable, to take any action necessary to conclude an
arbitration hereunder within 180 days of the filing of a Dispute with the
Administrator.  The arbitrator(s) shall be empowered to impose sanctions for any
Loan Party's failure to proceed within the times established herein.
Arbitrations shall be conducted in the state of the applicable substantive law
designated in the Documents.  The provisions of this Arbitration Program shall
survive an termination, amendment, or expiration hereof or of the Documents
unless the Loan Parties otherwise expressly agree in writing.  Each Loan Party
agrees to keep all Disputes and arbitration proceedings strictly confidential,
except for disclosures of information required in the ordinary course of
business of the Loan Parties or as required by applicable Law.  If any provision
of this Arbitration Program is declared invalid by any court, the remaining
provisions shall not be affected thereby and shall remain fully enforceable.

            11.24  PURPORTED ORAL AMENDMENTS.  BORROWER EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS MAY ONLY BE AMENDED OR
MODIFIED, OR THE PROVISIONS HEREOF OR THEREOF WAIVED OR SUPPLEMENTED, BY AN
INSTRUMENT IN WRITING THAT COMPLIES WITH SECTION 11.2.  BORROWER AGREES THAT IT
WILL NOT RELY ON ANY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR ORAL OR
WRITTEN STATEMENTS BY ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AGENT OR ANY BANK THAT DOES NOT
COMPLY WITH SECTION 11.2 TO EFFECT AN AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, WAIVER OR
SUPPLEMENT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to
be duly executed as of the date first above written.
