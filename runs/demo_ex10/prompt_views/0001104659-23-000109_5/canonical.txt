In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent and any duly appointed transfer agent for the registration or transfer of the securities described herein are hereby authorized to decline to make any transfer of securities if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this Agreement.

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement. All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred and any obligations of the undersigned shall be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs or personal representatives of the undersigned.

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that it now has and, except as contemplated by this Agreement, will have good and marketable title to its Restricted Securities, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, and claims that could impact the ability of the undersigned to comply with the foregoing restrictions. The undersigned agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer instructions with Parent’s transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of any Restricted Securities during the Lock-up Period.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Merger Agreement (other than the provisions thereof which survive termination) shall terminate or be terminated prior to the Closing, the undersigned shall be released from all obligations under this Agreement. The undersigned understands that Parent and the Company are proceeding with the Merger in reliance upon this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall terminate upon the expiration of the Lock-up Period.

This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or related to this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. All notices, requests, instructions, claims, consents and other communications made in connection with this Agreement, shall be provided in accordance with Section 11.16 of the Merger Agreement,

mutatis mutandis , with respect to the undersigned, to the address or email address set forth on the signature page hereto.

The provisions of this Agreement may be amended, modified or waived only with the prior written consent of the Company and the holders of the Restricted Securities (each, a “ Holder ” and collectively the “ Holders ”) representing a majority of the Restricted Securities; provided that (i) no such amendment, modification or waiver that would adversely affect a Holder in a manner that is different from any other Holder shall be effective against such Holder without the prior written consent of such Holder and (ii) if any amendment, modification, waiver or release of this Agreement provides any Holder with rights superior to the rights provided to other Holders, such amendment, modification or waiver shall provide such rights to all Holders. The failure or delay of any Person to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed as a waiver of such provisions and shall not affect the right of such Person thereafter to enforce each and every provision of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. A waiver or consent to or of any breach or default by any Person in the performance by that Person of his, her or its obligations under this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a consent or waiver to or of any other breach or default in the performance by that Person of the same or any other obligations of that Person under this Agreement.

The undersigned acknowledges that its obligations under this Agreement are unique, recognizes and affirms that in the event of its breach of this Agreement, money damages would be inadequate and Parent will have no adequate remedy at law, and agrees that irreparable damage might occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the undersigned in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, Parent shall be entitled to an injunction or restraining order to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the undersigned and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without the requirement to post any bond or other security or to prove that money damages would be inadequate, this being in addition to any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled under this Agreement, at law or in equity.
