[[A0265]]
The Company acknowledges and agrees that a Purchaser may from time to time pledge pursuant to a bona fide margin agreement with a registered broker-dealer or grant a security interest in some or all of the Securities to a financial institution that is an “accredited investor” as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act and who agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement and, if required under the terms of such arrangement, such Purchaser may transfer, pledge or secure Securities to the pledgees or secured parties.

[[A0270]]
Upon the receipt by the Company of any reasonable certifications from the Purchasers requested by the Company with respect to future sales of such Offering Shares, the Company shall cause its counsel to issue a legal opinion to the Transfer Agent if required by the Transfer Agent to effect the removal of the legend hereunder.

[[A0271]]
The Company agrees that following such time as such legend is no longer required under this Section 4.1(c), it will, as soon as practicable following the delivery by a Purchaser to the Company or the Transfer Agent of a certificate or book-entry security entitlement evidencing Offering Shares issued with a restrictive legend and, in each case, any reasonable certifications from the Purchaser requested by the Company or the Company’s counsel in order to effectuate a legend removal, deliver or cause to be delivered to such Purchaser a certificate representing such shares that is free from all restrictive and other legends.
