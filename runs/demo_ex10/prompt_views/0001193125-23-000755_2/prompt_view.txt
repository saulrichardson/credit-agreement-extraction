Company hereby employs the Executive as Chief Financial Officer of the Company and the Executive hereby accepts such employment, on the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth.

- During the term of this Employment Agreement, the Executive shall be and have the title of Chief Financial Officer of the Company and
shall devote his entire business time and all reasonable efforts to his employment in that capacity with such other duties as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Company, which duties shall be consistent
with such position.

For service as an officer and employee of the Company, the Company agrees that the Executive shall be entitled to the full protection of the applicable indemnification provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and

Disability
. The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice in the event of the Executive’s “disability.” For purposes of this Employment Agreement, the
Executive’s “disability” shall be deemed to have occurred only after one hundred fifty (150) days in the aggregate during any consecutive twelve (12) month period, or after one hundred twenty (120) consecutive days,
during which one hundred fifty (150) or one hundred twenty (120) days, as the case may be, the Executive, by reason of his physical or mental disability or illness, shall have been unable to substantially discharge his duties under this
Employment Agreement. The date of disability shall be such one hundred fiftieth (150th) or one hundred twentieth (120th) day, as the case may be. In the event either the Company or the Executive, after receipt of notice of the Executive’s
disability from the other, disputes whether the Executive’s disability shall have occurred, the Executive shall promptly submit to a physical examination by the chief of medicine of any major accredited hospital in the Buffalo, New York area
and, unless such physician shall issue his written statement to the effect that in his opinion, based on his diagnosis, the Executive is capable of resuming his employment and devoting his full time and energy to discharging his duties within thirty
- days after the date of such statement, such permanent disability shall be deemed to have occurred.

(c)

- The Executive’s fraud, commission of a felony, commission of an act or series of acts of dishonesty which are
materially inimical to the best interests of the Company, or the Executive’s willful and substantial failure to perform his duties under this Employment Agreement, which failure has not been cured within a reasonable time (which shall not be
less than thirty (30) days) after the Company gives notice thereof to the Executive;

or

- The
Executive’s material breach of any material provision of this Employment Agreement which breach, if capable of being cured, has not been cured in all substantial respects within thirty (30) days) after the Company gives notice thereof to
the Executive; or

in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the “Board”) render his continued employment materially damaging or detrimental to the Company.

(d)
Termination Without Cause
. The Company may terminate this Employment Agreement
without cause by notifying the Executive in writing of its election to terminate at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of termination. The Executive may, on written notice to the Company, accelerate the effective date of

give the Company a written notice, within 90 days following the initial occurrence of the event, describing the event that the Executive claims to be Good Reason and stating the Executive’s intention to terminate employment unless the

- the Company materially diminishes the salary, fringe benefits or other compensation being paid to the Executive;

- the failure of any successor of the Company to furnish the assurances provided for in Section 7(c).

In the case of events described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), the Company shall have 30 days from the date of receipt of the written notice from the Executive stating his claim of Good Reason in which to take appropriate corrective action. If the Company does not cure the Good Reason, the Good Reason will be deemed to have occurred at the end of the 30-day

period.

(f)
Termination By Mutual Agreement
. This Employment Agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the Company and
the Executive.

(g)
Resignation
. The Executive may terminate this Employment Agreement at any time with sixty (60) days’

Severance Payments
.

(a)
Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason
. The Company will make the severance payments
specified in Section 5(b) below if this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 4(d) (Without Cause) or (e) (for Good Reason) hereof. In addition, the employee welfare benefits referred to in Exhibit A,
Section 1(c) shall be continued for a period of thirty (30) months after termination of employment provided, however, the Executive and not the Company shall pay the premiums for any such benefits during the first
6-months
of the
30-month
period following the Executive’s Separation from Service in any case where the payment of the premiums by the Company would constitute gross
income to the Executive.

(b)
Severance Payments
. In the event this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 4(d) (Without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) prior to, or more than two years after, a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company or a
Non-Section 409A
Change in
Control of the Company , the Company will pay the Executive an aggregate amount equal to two (2) times the salary and bonus paid to the Executive in the prior calendar year (the
“Non-Change
in
Control Severance”). In the event this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (Without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) at the time of or within two years after a Section 409A Change in Control of the
Company or a
Non-Section 409A
Change in Control of the Company, the Company will pay the Executive an aggregate amount equal to two and a half (2.5) times the salary and bonus paid to the Executive in the
prior calendar year.

(c)
Severance Payments Without Change in Control.
Except as set forth in Section 5(d) below, the
severance payable pursuant to Section 5(b) shall paid in thirty (30) equal monthly payments each in an amount equal to 1/30th of the aggregate amount of the severance payments.    The 30 monthly payments described
in the preceding sentence shall be deemed a series of separate payments within the meaning of Treas. Reg.
§1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii).
The first six monthly payments shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum
within 30 days following his Separation from Service. The remaining twenty-four (24) monthly payments shall be paid to the Executive in twenty-four (24) separate payments on the first day of twenty-four (24) successive calendar
months with the first payment occurring on the first day of the seventh calendar month beginning after the date of the Executive’s Separation from Service. The parties affirm that it is their intent that the first six monthly payments be
excluded from the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) by reason of the “short-term deferral” rule set forth at Regulation

§1.409A-1(b)(4).

- 4 -

(d)
Severance Payments With Change in Control
.

(i)
Section
409A Change in Control
. If this Employment Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 4(d) (Without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) within two years after a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company has occurred, or if a Section 409A Change in Control of the Company occurs while the Company is
making
Non-Change
in Control Severance payments, the Executive shall receive the applicable severance payments specified in Section 5(b) (or the remaining balance thereof) in a lump sum. The lump sum
shall be paid within 30 days after the effective date of the Executive’s Separation from Service or, if the Section 409A Change in Control occurs after the Executive’s Separation from Service, within 30 days after such
Section 409A Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicable severance payments specified in Section 5(b) shall not be paid to the Executive (except for the lump sum equal to six monthly payments provided in the third
sentence of Section 5(c)) before the day following the
6-month
anniversary of the Executive’s Separation from Service unless the Executive shall have received an opinion of counsel satisfactory to
the Executive that payment before that date will not be a violation of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) (concerning the
6-month
delay rule). In the event that the Executive shall fail to obtain such an
opinion of counsel, the Company or its successor shall, within 30 days after the later of the Executive’s Separation from Service or the Section 409A Change in Control, transfer the remaining balance of the monthly payments due the
Executive to a rabbi trust (similar to the trust described in Revenue Procedure
92-64)
under a trust agreement that requires payment of such remaining balance to the Executive in a lump sum on the day
following the
6-month
anniversary of the Executive’s Separation from Service.

(ii)
Non-Section
409A Change in Control
. If this Employment
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 4(d) (Without Cause) or Section 4(e) (for Good Reason) within two years after a
Non-Section 409A
Change in Control of the Company has occurred, or if
a
Non-Section 409A
Change in Control of the Company occurs while the Company is making
Non-Change
in Control Severance payments to the Executive pursuant to
Section 5(b) and 5(c), the Company or its successor shall, within 30 days after the
Non-Section
409A Change in Control, transfer the remaining balance of the monthly payments due the Executive to a
rabbi trust (similar to the trust described in Revenue Procedure
92-64)
under a trust agreement that requires payment of such remaining balance to the Executive from the trust in accordance with the original
payment schedule under Section 5(c).

(e)
Reimbursement of Legal Fees and Expenses
. The Company shall also reimburse the
Executive (promptly upon documented request), the amount of all legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the Executive in connection with any good faith claim for severance compensation hereunder, including all such fees and expenses incurred
in contesting or disputing, by arbitration or otherwise, any such termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by this Employment Agreement or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable
to the application of Section 4999 of the Code to any payment or benefit provided hereunder.

- 5 -

(f)
No Obligation to Mitigate Damages
. The Executive shall be under no obligation to
mitigate damages with respect to termination and in the event the Executive is employed or receives income from any other source there shall be no offset therefor against the amounts due from the Company hereunder.

(g)
Reduction of Severance Pay to Avoid Excise Taxes
. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the amounts payable to the
Employee pursuant to Sections 5(b), Section 5(c) and Section 5(d) shall be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid imposition on the Employee of any tax on excess parachute payments under Section 4999 of the Code.

period
following the termination of this Employment Agreement, the Executive shall not: (A) own, manage, control or participate in the ownership, management, or control of, or be employed or engaged by or otherwise affiliated or associated as a

Company, any confidential information relating to the Company’s operations, properties or otherwise to its particular business or other trade secrets of the Company, it being acknowledged by the Executive that all such information regarding the
business of the Company compiled or obtained by, or furnished to, the Executive while the Executive shall have been employed by or associated with the Company is confidential information and the Company’s exclusive property; provided, however,

- 6 -

- The Executive agrees and understands that the remedy at law for any breach by him of

any legally enforceable provision of this Paragraph 6, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach.

- The Executive has carefully considered the nature and extent of the restrictions upon him and the rights and remedies conferred upon the
Company under this Paragraph 6, and hereby acknowledges and agrees that the same are reasonable in time and territory, are designed to eliminate competition which otherwise would be unfair to the Company, do not stifle the inherent skill and
experience of the Executive, would not operate as a bar to the Executive’s sole means of support, are fully required to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and do not confer a benefit upon the Company disproportionate to the
detriment to the Executive.

otherwise, which would restrict or prohibit him from undertaking or performing employment in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Employment Agreement.

assets of the Company must, within ten (10) days after the Executive’s request, furnish its written assurance that it is bound to perform this Employment Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would have been
required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.

Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association then pertaining in the City of Buffalo, New York, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator or
arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator or arbitrators shall be deemed to possess the powers to issue mandatory orders and restraining orders in connection with such arbitration; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 7(d) shall be construed so as to deny the Company the right and power to seek and obtain injunctive relief in a court of equity for any breach or threatened breach by the Executive of any of his covenants contained in
Section 6 hereof.

or the Executive may hereafter designate in writing to the other.

- 7 -

- The failure of either party to enforce any provision or provisions of this Employment
Agreement shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision or provisions as to any future violations thereof, nor prevent that party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of this Employment Agreement. The rights
granted the parties herein are cumulative and the waiver of any single remedy shall not constitute a waiver of such party’s right to assert all other legal remedies available to it under the circumstances.

orally. No modification, termination or attempted waiver shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the same is sought to be enforced.
