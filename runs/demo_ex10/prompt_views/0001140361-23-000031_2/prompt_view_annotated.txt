[[A0274]]
RESOLVED, that the rights, powers and privileges, and the restrictions, qualifications and limitations, of the Series C Preferred Stock as set forth in the Certificate of Designations are hereby approved and adopted by the Board of Directors and the Series C Preferred Stock is hereby authorized out of the Corporation’s authorized Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share; and the form, terms and provisions of the Certificate of Designations are hereby approved, adopted, ratified and confirmed in all respects as follows:

[[A0275]]

[[A0277]]
Section 1.1 . There is hereby created out of the authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation a series of preferred stock designated “Series C Convertible Preferred Stock” (the “ Series C Preferred Stock ”), consisting of twenty-three thousand, one hundred two (23,102) shares, par value $0.0001 per share (each, a “ Series C Preferred Share ”).

Series C Preferred Shares which have been converted, redeemed, repurchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be retired and, following the filing of any certificate required by the DGCL, will have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the Corporation’s Preferred Stock, without designation as to series, until such shares are once more designated by the Board of Directors as part of a particular series of Preferred Stock.

[[A0279]]
ARTICLE 2

[[A0280]]

[[A0281]]
Section 2.1 . The Series C Preferred Stock shall, with respect to rights upon an acquisition, merger or consolidation of the Corporation, sale of all or substantially all assets of the Corporation, other business combination or liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, either voluntary or involuntary (collectively, a “ Liquidation Event ”) rank:

[[A0282]]
- senior to the Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Corporation (including any capital stock into which the Class A Common Stock shall have been converted, exchanged or reclassified following the date hereof, the “ Class A Common Stock ”), the Class V Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Corporation (the “ Class V Common Stock ” and together with the Class A Common Stock, the “ Common Stock ”), and any other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation, the terms of which do not expressly provide that such class or series ranks senior to or on a parity with the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to rights upon a Liquidation Event (collectively, together with any warrants, rights, calls or options exercisable for or convertible into such capital stock, the “ Junior Stock ”);

- on a parity with any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation, the terms of which provide that such class or series ranks on a parity with the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to rights upon a Liquidation Event (collectively, together with any warrants, rights, calls or options exercisable for or convertible into such capital stock, the “ Parity Stock ”); and

CONVERSION; FUNDAMENTAL TRANSACTIONS

[[A0308]]
Section 4.1 . Securities To Be Delivered Upon Conversion.

[[A0309]]
Each Series C Preferred Share shall be convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock or Pre-Funded Warrants (the “ Conversion Securities ”) at a conversion rate equal to (i) (A) the Stated Value plus (B) cash in lieu of fractional shares, as set forth in Section 4.7 divided by (ii) a conversion price of $0.40 per share of Class A Common Stock (subject to the adjustments in Section 4.5 herein, the “ Conversion Price ”) as provided in this Article 4 . On the date of conversion, with respect to each Series C Preferred Share, uncertificated book-entry shares representing the number of shares of Class A Common Stock into which such share of Series C Preferred Stock is converted (or Pre-Funded Warrants with respect to such shares, as applicable) shall be promptly issued and delivered to the Holder thereof or such Holder’s designee upon presentation and surrender of the certificate evidencing the Series C Preferred Stock, if any (or, if such certificate or certificates have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and indemnity in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Corporation), to the Corporation and, if required, the furnishing of appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the payment of all transfer and similar taxes, if any, allocable to the Holder pursuant to Section 4.4 . The Person or Persons entitled to receive the Class A Common Stock and/or cash issuable upon conversion of Series C Preferred Stock (or Pre-Funded Warrants) shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of Class A Common Stock and/or securities (including Pre-Funded Warrants) as of the close of business on the date of conversion with respect thereto.

[[A0310]]
In the event that a Holder shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Class A Common Stock and/or cash (or Pre-Funded Warrants) to be issued or paid upon conversion or shares of Series C Preferred Stock should be registered or paid or the manner in which such shares (or Pre-Funded Warrants) should be delivered, the Corporation shall be entitled to register and deliver such shares (or Pre-Funded Warrants), and make such payment, in the name of the Holder and in the manner shown on the records of the Corporation.

[[A0311]]
Section 4.2 . Optional Conversion .

[[A0312]]
(a)
Optional Conversion Right
.

[[A0313]]
Subject to
Section 4.3
, from and after the issuance of the Series C Preferred Shares (the “
Issuance Date
”), each Holder shall be entitled to
convert all or a portion of such Holder’s Series C Preferred Shares, at any time and from time to time (any such conversion, an “
Optional Conversion
”), into a number of duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Class A Common Stock as set forth in this
Article 4
. From and after any such conversion, the Series C Preferred Shares so converted
shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of the Holder with respect to such Series C Preferred Shares shall immediately terminate, except the right to receive the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to such Optional
Conversion.

[[A0314]]
(b)
Notice of Optional Conversion
. In order to effect an Optional
Conversion, a Holder shall submit a written notice to the Corporation, duly executed by an officer of the Holder and in the form attached hereto as Annex A (the “
Optional Conversion Notice
”),
stating that the Holder irrevocably elects to convert the number of Series C Preferred Shares specified in such Optional Conversion Notice.

[[A0315]]
Upon receiving an Optional Conversion Notice, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such Holder the
number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Series C Preferred Shares.

[[A0316]]
(c)
Beneficial Ownership Limitation
. The Corporation shall not
effect any conversion of Series C Preferred Shares, and a Holder shall not have the right to convert any Series C Preferred Shares, to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion set forth on the applicable Optional Conversion Notice, such
Holder (together with such Holder’s Affiliates, and any Persons acting as a group together with such Holder or any of such Holder’s Affiliates (such Persons, “
Attribution Parties
”)) would
beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties
shall include the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Class A Common Stock which are
issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining, unconverted shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Series C Preferred Stock beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the
unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Corporation subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution
Parties.

[[A0317]]
Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this
Section 4.2
, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “
Exchange Act
”) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

[[A0318]]
To the extent that the limitation contained in this
Section 4.2
applies, the determination of whether the Series C Preferred Stock is convertible (in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of how
many Series C Preferred Shares are convertible shall be in the sole discretion of such Holder, and the submission of an Optional Conversion Notice shall be deemed to be such Holder’s determination of whether such Series C Preferred Shares may be
converted (in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and how many Series C Preferred Shares are convertible, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.

[[A0319]]
To ensure
compliance with this restriction, each Holder will be deemed to represent to the Corporation each time it delivers an Optional Conversion Notice that such Optional Conversion Notice has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph and
the Corporation shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination.

[[A0320]]
In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

[[A0321]]
For purposes of this
Section 4.2
, in determining the number of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number
of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (i) the Corporation’s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as the case may be, (ii) a more recent
public announcement by the Corporation or (iii) a more recent written notice by the Corporation or the Corporation’s transfer agent setting forth the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding.

[[A0322]]
Upon the written or oral request (which may be
via email) of a Holder, the Corporation shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and in writing to such Holder the number of shares of Class A Common Stock then outstanding.

[[A0323]]
In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock
shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Corporation, including the Series C Preferred Stock, by such Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of
outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock was reported.

[[A0324]]
The “
Beneficial Ownership Limitation
” shall be 9.99% of the number of shares of the Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately
after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Series C Preferred Shares held by the applicable Holder.

[[A0325]]
The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of Series C
Preferred Stock.

[[A0326]]
Section 4.3 . Automatic Conversion .

[[A0327]]
(a)
Automatic Conversion
. Upon the fifth anniversary of the
Issuance Date, each outstanding Series C Preferred Share will automatically and immediately convert (the “
Automatic Conversion
”) into a number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Class A Common Stock or Pre-Funded Warrants as set forth in this
Article 4
without any further action by the Holders.

[[A0328]]
From and after the Automatic Conversion,
the Series C Preferred Shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of the Holders with respect to such Series C Preferred Shares shall immediately terminate, except the right to receive the shares of Class A Common Stock or
Pre-Funded Warrants, as applicable.

[[A0329]]
(b)
Automatic Conversion Notice
. In advance of the occurrence of
the Automatic Conversion, the Corporation shall deliver to all Holders a written notice of the Automatic Conversion pursuant to this
Section 4.3
.

[[A0330]]
(c)
Automatic Conversion Beneficial Ownership Limitation
.

[[A0331]]
Upon the
Automatic Conversion, in lieu of issuing any shares of Class A Common Stock to a Holder that would exceed the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, the Corporation will issue, and the Holder will receive, pre-funded warrants exercisable for the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock which would otherwise be issuable (“
Pre-Funded Warrants
”), substantially in the form attached hereto as
Annex
B
, the exercise of which shall be subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.

[[A0332]]
Section 4.4 .

[[A0333]]
Transfer Taxes . Issuances of shares of Class A Common Stock or Pre-Funded Warrants upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issuance or transfer tax in respect of the issuance thereof; provided, however , that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of shares of Class A Common Stock or Pre-Funded Warrants in a name other than that of the converting Holder, and no such issuance or delivery need be made unless and until the Person requesting such issuance or delivery has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been, or will timely be, paid.

[[A0334]]
Section 4.5 . Adjustments for Subsequent Events . From and after the date of this Certificate of Designations, adjustments shall be made to the Conversion Price from time to time as follows:

[[A0335]]
(a)
Adjustment Upon Stock Dividends, Certain Issuances, Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock
.  If the Corporation, at any time while Series C Preferred
Shares are outstanding:  (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions on shares of Class A Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) subdivides
outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues by reclassification of
shares of the Class A Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Corporation, then in each case the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Class A Common Stock (excluding
treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event.

[[A0336]]
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 4.5(a)
shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision,
combination or re‑classification.

[[A0337]]
- Fundamental Transaction .

[[A0338]]
If, at any time while Series C Preferred Shares are outstanding, (i) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another Person (excluding a merger effected solely to change the Corporation’s name), (ii) the Corporation (and all of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any direct or indirect purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Corporation or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Class A Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and such offer has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Class A Common Stock, (iv) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Class A Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Class A Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, merger or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person or group acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (not including any shares of Class A Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a “ Fundamental Transaction ”), then, upon any subsequent Optional Conversion or the Automatic Conversion, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each share of Class A Common Stock that would have been issuable upon such Optional Conversion or the Automatic Conversion immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, at the option of the Holder (without regard to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation), the number of shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation, or of the Class A Common Stock if the Corporation is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the “ Alternate Consideration ”) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock into which a Holder’s Series C Preferred Shares are convertible immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation).

[[A0339]]
c) Alternate Consideration . If holders of Class A Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any Optional Conversion or the Automatic Conversion following such Fundamental Transaction.

[[A0340]]
The Corporation shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Corporation is not the survivor (the “ Successor Entity ”) to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4.5(c) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for the Series C Preferred Shares a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Certificate of Designations which is convertible for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Class A Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon an Optional Conversion or the Automatic Conversion (without regard to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with a conversion price which applies the Conversion Price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such conversion price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of the Series C Preferred Shares immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder.

[[A0341]]
Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for, the Corporation so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents referring to the “Company” or the “Corporation” shall refer instead to the Successor Entity, and the Successor Entity may exercise every right and power of the Corporation and shall assume all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Corporation herein.

.

[[A0481]]

the Company with or into another Person (excluding a merger effected solely to change the Company’s name), (B) the Company (and all of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (C) any direct or indirect purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person)
is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and such offer has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Stock,
- the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively
converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including,
without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, merger or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person or group acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not
including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each
a “
Fundamental Transaction
”), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would have
been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, at the option of the Holder (without regard to any limitation in
Section
3(f)(i)

[[A0482]]
on the exercise of this Warrant), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the “ Alternate Consideration ”) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 3(f)(i) on the exercise of this Warrant).

[[A0483]]
7

[[A0484]]
- For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Strike Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Strike Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration.

[[A0485]]
If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction.

[[A0486]]
The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the “ Successor Entity ”) to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4(c)(ii) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Warrant a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant which is exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder.

[[A0487]]
Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for, the Company so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents referring to the “Company” shall refer instead to the Successor Entity, and the Successor Entity may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein.

[[A0488]]
- Other Distributions .  During such time as this Warrant is outstanding, if the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) other than any such dividend or distribution that is subject to Section 4(c)(i) hereof (a “ Distribution ”), at any time after the issuance of this Warrant, then, in each such case, the Strike Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Strike Price in effect immediately prior to the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such Distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the closing price on the record date mentioned above, and of which the numerator shall be such closing price on such record date less the then-per-share fair market value at such record date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one outstanding share of the Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith, and the number of Warrant Shares shall be proportionately adjusted such that the Aggregate Strike Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged.

[[A0489]]
In either case the adjustments shall be described in a statement provided to the Holder of the portion of assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or such subscription rights applicable to one share of Common Stock.

[[A0490]]
Such adjustment shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date mentioned above.

[[A0491]]

[[A0492]]
- Repurchases.

[[A0493]]
Unless otherwise adjusted pursuant to Section 4(c)(i) through (vi) hereof, if, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, the Company effects any Repurchases, then, following the completion of the Repurchase, the Strike Price shall be reduced to the price determined by multiplying the Strike Price in effect immediately prior to the date of the Repurchase by a fraction of which the numerator shall be (a) the product of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the date of the Repurchase and (2) the closing price of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the Company’s first public disclosure of its intent to effect such Repurchases, minus (b) the Assumed Payment Amount (as defined below), and of which the denominator shall be the product of (X) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the date of the Repurchase minus the number of shares of Common Stock so repurchased and (Y) the closing price of the Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the Company’s first public disclosure of its intent to effect such Repurchases.

[[A0494]]
In such event, the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be increased to the number obtained by multiplying such number of Warrant Shares by the quotient of (A) the Strike Price in effect immediately prior to the date of the Repurchases divided by (B) the new Strike Price determined in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

[[A0495]]
For purposes of the foregoing, the “Assumed Payment Amount” with respect to any Repurchases shall mean the closing price as of the date of such Repurchases, of the aggregate consideration paid to effect such Repurchases and “Repurchases” means any transaction or series of related transactions to purchase Common Stock of the Company for a purchase price greater than the closing price on the trading day immediately prior to such transactions pursuant to any tender offer or exchange offer.

[[A0496]]
- Exceptions to Adjustment Upon Issuance of Common Stock .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary herein, there shall be no adjustment to the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant or the Strike Price with respect to any Excluded Issuance.

[[A0497]]
- Notices .  Whenever the Strike Price or the Warrant Shares are adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 4 , the Company shall send to the Holder a notice setting forth the adjusted Strike Price or Warrant Shares and a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.

[[A0498]]
In the event the Company shall consummate any Fundamental Transaction then, unless the Company has made a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K, which filing discloses such Fundamental Transaction, the Company shall give to each Holder a written notice of such Fundamental Transaction.

[[A0503]]
In addition, nothing contained in this Warrant shall be construed as imposing any liabilities on the Holder to purchase any securities (upon exercise of this Warrant or otherwise) or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liabilities are asserted by the Company or by creditors of the Company.
