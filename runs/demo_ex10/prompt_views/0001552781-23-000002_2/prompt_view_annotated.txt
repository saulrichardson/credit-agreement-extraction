Section 409A of the Code .

[[A0157]]
(a)

[[A0158]]
The compensation and benefits provided by this Agreement are intended to be exempt from or comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed consistent with that intent.

[[A0159]]
- A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits considered “nonqualified deferred compensation” under Section 409A of the Code upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a “termination,” “termination of employment” or like terms shall mean “separation from service.” Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that the right to any payment (including the provision of benefits) hereunder provides for the “deferral of compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code, the payment shall be paid (or provided) in accordance with this Section 5. If Executive is a “Specified Employee” within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code on the date of Executive’s termination, then to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code, no payment to Executive by reason of his separation from service of any amounts or benefits considered “nonqualified deferred compensation” under Section 409A of the Code shall be made or commence during the period beginning on the date of Executive’s termination and ending on the date that is six months following Executive’s termination or, if earlier, on the date of Executive’s death.

[[A0160]]
The amount of any payment that would otherwise be paid to Executive during this period shall instead be paid to Executive on the fifteenth day of the first calendar month following the end of the period.

[[A0161]]
Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Agreement shall be construed as a separate and distinct payment for purposes of Section 409A.

[[A0162]]
(c)

[[A0163]]
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided to Executive does not constitute “nonqualified deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, (i) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to Executive in any other calendar year, (ii) the reimbursements for expenses for which Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred and (iii) any right of Executive to reimbursement for expenses or to in-kind benefits may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.

Section 280G . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement (or any plan, policy, agreement or other arrangement covering Executive), if any payment, right or benefit paid, provided or due to Executive, whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise (each, a “ Payment ,” and collectively, the “ Total Payments ”), would subject Executive to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “ Excise Tax ”), then the Total Payments will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the Excise Tax, but only if (i) the amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced, is greater than or equal to (ii) the amount of such Total Payments without reduction (in each case, determined on an after-tax basis). Any reduction of the Total Payments required by this ‎paragraph will be implemented by determining the Parachute Ratio (as defined below) for each Payment and then by reducing the Payments in order, beginning with the Payment with the highest Parachute Ratio.

[[A0167]]
For Payments with the same Parachute Ratio, later Payments will be reduced before earlier Payments.

[[A0168]]
For Payments with the same Parachute Ratio and the same time of payment, each Payment will be reduced proportionately.

[[A0169]]
For purposes of this paragraph, “ Parachute Ratio ” means a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the value of the applicable Payment, as calculated for purposes of Section 280G of the Code, and (y) the denominator of which is the economic value of the applicable Payment.

Source of Payments .

[[A0187]]
Severability . All provisions of this Agreement are intended to be severable.

[[A0189]]
The Parties hereto further agree that any such invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified so that it shall be enforced to the greatest extent permissible under law, and to the extent that any court of competent jurisdiction determines any restriction herein to be unreasonable in any respect, such court may limit this Agreement to render it reasonable in the light of the circumstances in which it was entered into and specifically enforce this Agreement as limited.
