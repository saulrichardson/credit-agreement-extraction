provided
that, if the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent that the Borrower requests an amendment to any provision hereof to eliminate the effect of any change occurring after the date hereof in GAAP or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or
46
after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance herewith. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, (i) all terms of an accounting or financial nature used herein shall be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to herein shall be made (x) without giving effect to any election under Accounting Standards Codification 825-10-25 (or any other Accounting Standards Codification or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Borrower or any Subsidiary at “fair value”, as defined therein and (y) without giving effect to any treatment of Indebtedness in respect of convertible debt instruments under Accounting Standards Codification 470-20 (or any other Accounting Standards Codification or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any such Indebtedness in a reduced or bifurcated manner as described therein, and such Indebtedness shall at all times be valued at the full stated principal amount thereof and (ii) any obligations relating to a lease that was accounted for as an operating lease as of the Effective Date and any similar lease entered into after the Effective Date shall be accounted for as obligations relating to an operating lease and not as Capital Lease Obligations.
(b)
All pro forma computations required to be made hereunder giving effect to any acquisition or disposition, or issuance, incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness, or other transaction shall in each case be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (and, in the case of any pro forma computation made hereunder, to determine whether such acquisition, disposition, issuance, incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness or other transaction is permitted to be consummated hereunder) immediately after giving effect to such acquisition, disposition, issuance, incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness or other transaction consummated since the first day of the period for which such pro forma computation is being made and on or prior to the date of such computation, as if such transaction had occurred on the first day of the most recent Test Period, and, to the extent applicable, to the historical earnings and cash flows associated with the assets acquired or disposed of (but without giving effect to any synergies or cost savings, except as set forth in the definition of “EBITDA”) and any related incurrence or reduction of Indebtedness, all in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period for which such pro forma computation is being made (taking into account any Swap Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness).
(c)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Loan Document to the contrary (but subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
Section 2.21(a)
), when calculating any applicable ratio or determining other compliance with this Agreement (including the determination of compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires that no Default or Event of Default has occurred, is continuing or would result therefrom) in connection with a Specified Transaction undertaken in connection with the consummation of a Limited Conditionality Acquisition, the date of determination of such ratio and determination of whether any Default or Event of Default has occurred, is continuing or would result therefrom or other applicable covenant shall, at the option of the Borrower (the Borrower’s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Conditionality Acquisition, an “
LCA Election
”), be deemed to be the date the Limited Conditionality Acquisition Agreement is entered into (the “
LCA Test Date
”) and if, after such ratios and other provisions are measured on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such Limited Conditionality Acquisition and the other Specified Transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness) as if they occurred at the beginning of the four (4) consecutive fiscal quarter period being used to calculate such financial ratio ending prior to the LCA Test Date, the
47
Borrower could have taken such action on the relevant LCA Test Date in compliance with such ratios and provisions, such provisions shall be deemed to have been complied with. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in EBITDA of the Borrower) at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Conditionality Acquisition, such ratios and other provisions will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Conditionality Acquisition is permitted hereunder and (y) such ratios and other provisions shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Conditionality Acquisition or related Specified Transactions. If the Borrower has made an LCA Election for any Limited Conditionality Acquisition, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of any ratio or basket availability with respect to any other Specified Transaction on or following the relevant LCA Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Conditionality Acquisition is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement for such Limited Conditionality Acquisition is terminated or expires without consummation of such Limited Conditionality Acquisition, any such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming such Limited Conditionality Acquisition and other transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated.

The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter related to any interest rate used in this Agreement, or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the existing interest rate being replaced or have the same volume or liquidity as did any existing interest rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates and/or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of any interest rate used in this Agreement or any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower.

48
sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.

provided

further
that to the extent of any such Net Proceeds therefrom that have not been so applied by the end of such 365-day period (or within a period of 180 days thereafter if by the end of such initial 365-day period the Borrower or one or more Subsidiaries shall have entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party to acquire such assets with such Net Proceeds), a prepayment shall be required in an amount equal to such Net Proceeds that have not been so applied.
(d)
The Borrower shall prepay the Term Loans on the date that is ten (10) days (or such longer period as the Administrative Agent may agree to in its reasonable discretion) after the earlier of (i) the date on which Borrower’s annual audited financial statements for the immediately preceding fiscal year are delivered pursuant to

Section 9.04(e)
made during such fiscal year or after year-end and prior to when such Excess Cash Flow prepayment is due (and in each case not deducted in determining any payment required to be made pursuant to this
Section 2.12(d)
in any prior fiscal year) to the extent such prepayments are funded with internally generated cash and excluding any such prepayment that reduced Excess Cash Flow. As used herein, “
ECF Percentage
” means (x) fifty percent (50%) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such period was greater than 3.00 to 1.00, (y) twenty five percent (25%) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such period was less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00 but greater than 2.25 to 1.00 and (z) zero percent (0%) if the Total Net Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such period was less than or equal to 2.25 to 1.00. Each Excess Cash Flow prepayment shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by a Financial Officer certifying the manner in which Excess Cash Flow and the resulting prepayment were calculated, which certificate shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent.
(e)
In the event of any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans made at a time when Term Loans of more than one Class are outstanding, the aggregate amount of such prepayment shall be allocated among all Classes of Term Loans pro rata based on the aggregate principal amounts of outstanding Borrowings of each Class;
provided
that, the amounts so allocable to any Class of Term Loans may be applied pro rata to other Term Loan Borrowings if so provided in the related Incremental Amendment or Refinancing Amendment establishing such additional Classes of Term Loans. All mandatory prepayment amounts pursuant to
Sections 2.12(c)
and
54
2.12(d)
that are allocable to the Tranche B Term Loans shall be applied,
first
, to the installments of the Tranche B Term Loans in direct order of maturity for the next eight (8) scheduled payments pursuant to

at least five (5) Business Days prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of such prepayment. Each such notice shall specify the date of such prepayment and provide a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Term Lender of the contents of the Borrower’s prepayment notice and of such Term Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the prepayment. Each Term Lender may reject all or a portion of its Applicable Percentage of any mandatory prepayment (such declined amounts, the “
Declined Proceeds
”) of Term Loans required to be made pursuant to
Section 2.12(c)
or
Section 2.12(d)
by providing written notice (each, a “
Rejection Notice
”) to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, three (3) Business Days after the date of such Term Lender’s receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent regarding such prepayment. Each Rejection Notice from a given Term Lender shall specify the principal amount of the mandatory prepayment of Term Loans to be rejected by such Term Lender. If a Term Lender fails to deliver a Rejection Notice to the Administrative Agent within the time frame specified above or such Rejection Notice fails to specify the principal amount of the Term Loans to be rejected, any such failure will be deemed an acceptance of the total amount of such mandatory repayment of Term Loans.

(a)
Subject to clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this Section 2.15, if:
(i)
(i)
the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive
and binding
absent manifest error)
- prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing,
that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted
LIBO
Term SOFR
Rate
or the LIBO Rate, as applicable
(including
, without limitation,
because the
LIBO Screen
Term SOFR Reference
Rate is not available or published on a current basis)
, for

and
such Interest Period
or (B) at any time, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR
; or
(ii)
(ii)
the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that
- prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing,
the Adjusted
LIBO
Term SOFR
Rate
or the LIBO Rate, as applicable,
for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of
56
making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period
or (B) at any time, Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing
;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders
through Electronic System as provided in Section 9.01
by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail
as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until
(x)
the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist
, (i)

with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the Borrower delivers a new Interest Election Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.08 or a new Borrowing Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.03,
any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any
Revolving
Borrowing to, or continuation of any
Revolving
Borrowing as, a
Eurodollar
Term Benchmark
Borrowing
shall be ineffective
and
- if
any Borrowing Request
that
requests a
Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.
Term Benchmark Revolving Borrowing shall instead be deemed to be an Interest Election Request or a Borrowing Request, as applicable, for (x) an RFR Borrowing so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not also the subject of Section 2.15(a)(i) or (ii) above or (y) an ABR Borrowing if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR also is the subject of Section 2.15(a)(i) or (ii) above; provided that if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowing, then all other Types of Borrowings shall be permitted. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan is outstanding on the date of the Borrower’s receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent referred to in this Section 2.15(a) with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until (x) the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist with respect to the relevant Benchmark and (y) the Borrower delivers a new Interest Election Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.08 or a new Borrowing Request in accordance with the terms of Section 2.03, (A) any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Borrowing so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not also the subject of Section 2.15(a)(i) or (ii) above or (y) an ABR Loan if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR also is the subject of Section 2.15(a)(i) or (ii) above, on such day, and (B) any RFR Loan shall on and from such day be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute an ABR Loan.

(b)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (a) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (b) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth (5
th
) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not
57
received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.

(b)

If at any time the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) the circumstances set forth in Section 2.15(a)(i) have arisen and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or (ii) the circumstances set forth in Section 2.15(a)(i) have not arisen but the supervisor for the administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has, after the Effective Date, made a public statement identifying a specific date after which the LIBO Screen Rate shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall endeavor to establish an alternate rate of interest to the LIBO Rate that gives due consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time, and shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable (but for the avoidance of doubt, such related changes shall not include a reduction of the Applicable Rate).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in Section 9.02, such amendment shall
herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will
become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement
so long as the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five (5) Business Days of the date notice of such alternate rate of interest is provided to the Lenders, a written notice from the Required Lenders of each Class stating that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. Until an alternate rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with this Section 2.15(b) (but, in the case of the circumstances described in clause (ii) of the first sentence of this Section 2.15(b), only to the extent the LIBO Screen Rate for such Interest Period is not available or published at such time on a current basis), (x) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (y) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing;
provided
that, if such alternate rate of interest shall be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement.

(e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the
58
Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
(f)
Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing or a conversion to or continuation of Term Benchmark Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any request for a Term Benchmark Borrowing into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to (A) an RFR Borrowing so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (B) an ABR Borrowing if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan is outstanding on the date of the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until such time as a Benchmark Replacement is implemented pursuant to this Section 2.15, (1) any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan, be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Borrowing so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) an ABR Loan if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event, on such day and (2) any RFR Loan shall on and from such day be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute an ABR Loan.

. Each payment by any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, unless required by applicable law. If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of deducted or withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such deduction or withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made.
(b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower
. The Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse the Administrative Agent for the payment of any Other Taxes.
(c)
Evidence of Payments
. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(d)
Indemnification by the Borrower
. Subject to Section 10.14, the Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient for any Indemnified Taxes that are paid or payable by such Recipient in connection with any Loan Document (including amounts paid or payable under this Section 2.18(d)) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.18(d) shall be paid within ten (10) days after the Recipient delivers to the Borrower a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so paid or payable by such Recipient and describing the basis for the indemnification claim. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent.
(e)
Indemnification by the Lenders
. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.18(e) shall be paid within ten (10) days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes
61
so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 2.18(e).
(f)
Status of Lenders
.
(i)
(i)
Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.18(f)(ii)(A) through (E) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.18(f). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.
(ii)
(ii)
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Lender with respect to the Borrower shall, if it is legally eligible to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies reasonably requested by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party hereto, duly completed and executed copies of whichever of the following is applicable:

(c)
(C)
in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender for whom payments under any Loan Document constitute income that is effectively connected with such Lender’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States, IRS Form W-8ECI;

(d)
(D)
in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code both (1) IRS Form W-8BEN/W-8BEN-E and (2) a tax certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit G-1
to the effect that such Lender is not (a) a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (b) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, (c) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (d) conducting a trade or business in the United States with which the relevant interest payments are effectively connected;

Exhibit G-2
on behalf of such partners; or
(f)
(F)
any other form prescribed by law as a basis for claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax together with such supplementary documentation necessary to enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the amount of Tax (if any) required by law to be withheld.
(iii)
(iii)
If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.18(f)(iii), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(g)
If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.18, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.18 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
, that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, shall repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax
63
returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
SECTION 2.19.
SECTION 2.19.
Payments Generally; Allocation of Proceeds; Sharing of Set-offs.
- The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.16, 2.17 or 2.18, or otherwise) prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, Floor L2, Chicago, Illinois 60603 and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.16, 2.17, 2.18 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars.
(b)
Any proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent (i) not constituting either (A) a specific payment of principal, interest, fees or other sum payable under the Loan Documents (which shall be applied as specified by the Borrower) or (B) a mandatory prepayment (which shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.12) or (ii) after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent so elects or the Required Lenders so direct, such proceeds shall be applied, subject to the terms of the ABL/Term Loan Intercreditor Agreement, ratably
first
, to pay any fees, indemnities, or expense reimbursements including amounts then due to the Administrative Agent from the Borrower,
second
, to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to the Lenders from the Borrower,
third
, to pay interest then due and payable on the Loans ratably and
fourth
, to the payment of any other Secured Obligation due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender by the Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless so directed by the Borrower, or unless a Default is in existence, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall apply any payment which it receives to any
Eurodollar
Term Benchmark
Loan of a Class, except (a) on the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such
Eurodollar
Term Benchmark
Loan or (b) in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding ABR Loans of the same Class and, in any such event, the Borrower shall pay the break funding payment required in accordance with Section 2.17. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reverse and reapply any and all such proceeds and payments to any portion of the Secured Obligations.
(c)
If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender of the same Class, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of such Class to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by such Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans of such Class;
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
64
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (excluding assignments to or purchases by a Purchasing Borrower Party in accordance with Section 9.04(e)) (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
(d)
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e)
If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.08(b), 2.19(e) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account over which the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive control as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections; in the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
(f)
The Administrative Agent may from time to time provide the Borrower with billing statements or invoices with respect to any of the Secured Obligations (the “
Billing Statements
”). The Administrative Agent is under no duty or obligation to provide Billing Statements, which, if provided, will be solely for the Borrower’s convenience. The Billing Statements may contain estimates of the amounts owed during the relevant billing period, whether of principal, interest, fees or other Secured Obligations. If the Borrower pays the full amount indicated on a Billing Statement on or before the due date indicated on such Billing Statement, the Borrower shall not be in default;
provided
that, acceptance by the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, of any payment that is less than the payment due at that time shall not constitute a waiver of the Administrative Agent’s or the Lenders’ right to receive payment in full at another time.
SECTION 2.20.
SECTION 2.20.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

(a)
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.16, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.18, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.16 or 2.18, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and
65
would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)
If any Lender (or its Affiliate) requests compensation under Section 2.16, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amounts to any Lender (or its Affiliate) or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender (or its Affiliate) pursuant to Section 2.18 and, in each case, such Lender (or its Affiliate) has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.20(a), or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 2.16 or 2.18) and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.16 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.18, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 2.21.
SECTION 2.21.
Incremental Term Facilities.

(a)
The Borrower may at any time or from time to time after the Effective Date, by notice to the Administrative Agent, request the establishment of one or more Incremental Term Facilities (which may take the form of an increase in the principal amount of any existing tranche of Term Loans);
provided
that, no Incremental Term Loans may be made unless:
(i)
(i)
- except in the case of an Incremental Term Facility incurred to finance a Limited Conditionality Acquisition, (1) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect (including pro forma effect) to the making of such Incremental Term Loans and (2) the representations and warranties set forth in each Loan Document shall be true and correct in all material respects immediately prior to, and immediately after giving effect to, such Incremental Term Facility, except to the extent any such representations or warranties are expressly limited to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such specified earlier date (provided that no materiality qualifier set forth in this subclause (A)(2) shall be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof) and (B) in the case of an Incremental Term Facility incurred to finance a Limited Conditionality Acquisition, (1) as of the date of execution of the Limited Conditionality Acquisition Agreement by the parties thereto, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result from entry into the Limited Conditionality Acquisition Agreement, (2) as of the date of the borrowing of such Incremental Term Loans, no Event of Default under clause (a), (b), (h) or (i) of Article VII shall be in existence immediately before or after giving effect (including pro forma effect) to such borrowing and to any concurrent transactions and any substantially
66
concurrent use of proceeds thereof, (3) the representations and warranties set forth in Article III shall be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of execution of the applicable Limited Conditionality Acquisition Agreement by the parties thereto, except to the extent any such representations or warranties are expressly limited to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such specified earlier date (provided that no materiality qualifier set forth in this subclause (B)(3) shall be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof), and (4) as of the date of the borrowing of such Incremental Term Loans, customary “Sungard” representations and warranties (with such representations and warranties to be reasonably determined by the Incremental Lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans) shall be true and correct in all material respects immediately before and after giving effect to the incurrence of such Incremental Term Loans, except to the extent any such representations or warranties are expressly limited to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such specified earlier date (provided that no materiality qualifier set forth in this
subclause (B)(4)
shall be applicable to any representations and warranties that are already qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect); and
(ii)
(ii)
to the extent reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall have received (x) such legal opinions, board resolutions, secretary’s certificates, officer’s certificates and other documents as shall reasonably be requested by the Administrative Agent in connection with any such transaction and (y) such reaffirmation agreements and/or such amendments to the Collateral Documents as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent in order to ensure that such Incremental Term Facilities are provided with the benefit of the applicable Loan Documents.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the aggregate principal amount of all Incremental Term Facilities shall not exceed the sum of (A) $50,000,000
plus
- an unlimited additional amount such that, in the case of this
clause (B)
only, after giving effect (including pro forma effect) thereto (assuming full drawing under such Incremental Term Facilities), the Secured Net Leverage Ratio calculated on a pro forma basis for the Test Period shall not exceed 3.75 to 1.00;
provided
that, for the avoidance of doubt, Incremental Term Facilities may be incurred pursuant to this
clause (B)
prior to utilization of the amount set forth in
clause (A)
above. Each Incremental Term Facility shall be in an integral multiple of $10,000,000 and be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $10,000,000, provided that such amount may be less than the applicable minimum amount if such amount represents all the remaining availability hereunder as set forth above. Each such notice shall specify (A) the date on which the Borrower proposes that the Incremental Term Loans shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than ten (10) Business Days (or such shorter period as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent) after the date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent and (B) the amount of the Incremental Term Loans being requested.
(b)
Each Incremental Term Facility shall be secured by a pari passu Lien on the Collateral (and no other property) on terms and pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the lenders providing such Incremental Term Facility. No Subsidiary shall be a borrower or a guarantor under any Incremental Term Facility unless such Subsidiary is a Loan Party which shall have previously or substantially concurrently guaranteed or borrowed, as applicable, the Secured Obligations. The Incremental Term Loans (i) if made as an increase in the principal amount of any existing tranche of Term Loans, shall have terms identical to those applicable to such Term Loans, (ii) shall not mature earlier than the Maturity Date applicable to any then existing Term Loans (but
67
may have amortization and/or customary prepayments prior to such date), (iv) shall have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity no shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any then existing Term Loans, (v) except as set forth above, shall be treated substantially the same as (and in any event, no more favorably than) the Term Loans and (vi) will accrue interest at rates determined by the Borrower and the lenders providing such Incremental Term Loans;
provided
that, in the event that the All-in Yield for any Incremental Term Loans shall be more than 0.50% higher than the corresponding All-in Yield for any then existing Term Loans, then the All-in Yield with respect to any then existing Term Loans shall be increased by the amount necessary so that the difference between the All-in Yield with respect to the Incremental Term Loans and the All-in Yield on any then existing Term Loans is equal to 0.50%. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders promptly upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of any notice from the Borrower referred to in this
Section 2.21(b)
and of the effectiveness of any Incremental Commitments, in each case advising the Lenders of the details thereof.
(c)
Incremental Term Facilities may be provided by any existing Lender (provided that no existing Lender shall have (x) an obligation to provide all or any portion of any Incremental Term Facility unless it so agrees in writing as provided in this
Section 2.21
or (y) the right to provide all or any portion of any Incremental Term Facility) or by any other bank, financial institution or other institutional lender or investor (other than an Ineligible Institution) (any such other bank, financial institution or other institutional lender or investor being called an “
Additional Lender
”);
provided
that, the Administrative Agent shall have consented (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) to such Lender or Additional Lender providing such Incremental Term Facility, to the extent such consent would be required under Section 9.04(b) for an assignment of Loans or Commitments to such Lender or Additional Lender. Commitments in respect of Incremental Term Facilities shall become Commitments under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment or amendment and restatement (each, an “
Incremental Amendment
”) of this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Lender agreeing to provide such Commitment, if any, each Additional Lender, if any, and the Administrative Agent. The Incremental Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section. The effectiveness of any Incremental Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction on the date thereof of each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 and such other conditions as the parties thereto shall agree. The Borrower will use the proceeds of the Incremental Term Facilities for any purpose not prohibited by this Agreement.
(d)
This Section 2.21 shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.19(c) or Section 9.02 to the contrary.
SECTION 2.22.
SECTION 2.22.
Returned Payments.
If after receipt of any payment which is applied to the payment of all or any part of the Secured Obligations (including a payment effected through exercise of a right of setoff), the Administrative Agent or any Lender is for any reason compelled to surrender such payment or proceeds to any Person because such payment or application of proceeds is invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be void or voidable as a preference, impermissible setoff, or a diversion of trust funds, or for any other reason (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion), then the Secured Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued and this Agreement shall continue in full force as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the Administrative Agent or such Lender. The provisions of this
Section 2.22
shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may have been taken by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in reliance upon such
68
payment or application of proceeds. The provisions of this

Defaulting Lenders.

(a)
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then such Defaulting Lender shall not have the right to vote on any issue on which voting is required (other than to the extent expressly provided in Section 9.02(b)) and the Commitment and Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02) or under any other Loan Document;
provided
, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02, this clause (a) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby.
(b)
In the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrower each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
SECTION 2.27.
SECTION 2.27.

Loan Modification Offers.

The Borrower may on one or more occasions, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, make one or more offers (each, a “
Loan Modification Offer
”) to all the Lenders of one or more Classes (each Class subject to such a Loan Modification Offer, an “
Affected Class
”) to make one or more Permitted Amendments pursuant to procedures reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to the Borrower. Such notice shall set forth (i) the terms and conditions of the requested Permitted Amendment and (ii) the date on which such Permitted Amendment is requested to become effective (which shall not be less than ten (10) Business Days nor more than thirty (30) Business Days after the date of such notice, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent). Permitted Amendments shall become effective only with respect to the Loans and Commitments of the Lenders of the Affected Class that accept the applicable Loan Modification Offer (such Lenders, the “
Accepting Lenders
”) and, in the case of any Accepting Lender, only with respect to such Lender’s Loans and Commitments of such Affected Class as to which such Lender’s acceptance has been made. With respect to all Permitted Amendments consummated by the Borrower pursuant to this
Section 2.27
, (i) such Permitted Amendments shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of
Section 2.12
and (ii) any Loan Modification Offer, unless contemplating a Maturity Date already in effect hereunder pursuant to a previously consummated Permitted Amendment, must be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000 (or such lesser amount as may be approved by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion);
provided
that the Borrower may at its election specify as a condition (a “
Minimum Extension Condition
”) to consummating any such Permitted Amendment that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant Loan Modification Offer in the Borrower’s sole
69
discretion and which may be waived by the Borrower) of Commitments or Loans of any or all Affected Classes be extended.
(b)

(c)
[Intentionally Omitted.]
(d)

Administrative Agent and the Lenders thereof, and, if requested by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, the Borrower will cause such assets to be subjected to a Lien securing the Secured Obligations and will take, and cause the Subsidiary Loan Parties to take, such actions as shall be necessary or reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent to grant and perfect such Liens, including actions described in paragraph (d) of this Section, all at the expense of the Loan Parties, subject, however, to the Limited Conditionality Provision.

(g)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, (i) in circumstances where the Administrative Agent reasonably determines that the cost or effort of obtaining or perfecting a security interest in any Equity Interest or other asset that constitutes Collateral is excessive in relation to the benefit afforded to the Secured Parties thereby, the Administrative Agent may exclude such Collateral from the creation and perfection requirements set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (ii) the Administrative Agent may grant extensions of time for the creation or perfection of Liens in particular property (including extensions of time beyond the Effective Date) where it determines that such creation or perfection cannot be accomplished without undue effort or expense by the time or times at which it would otherwise be required by this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

Each of the Lenders, on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates that are Secured Parties hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf, including execution of the other Loan Documents, and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

SECTION 8.05.

SECTION 8.05.
Actions through Sub-Agents.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Administrative Agent.

SECTION 8.06.
Resignation.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.

The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor, unless otherwise agreed by the Borrower and such successor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its intent to resign, the retiring Administrative Agent may give notice of the effectiveness of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower, whereupon, on the date of effectiveness of such resignation stated in such notice, (a) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, provided that, solely for purposes of maintaining any security interest granted to the Administrative Agent under any Collateral Document for the benefit of the Secured Parties, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to be vested with such security interest as collateral agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and, in the case of any Collateral in the possession of the Administrative Agent, shall continue to hold such Collateral, in each case until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed and accepts such appointment in accordance with this paragraph (it being understood and agreed that the retiring Administrative Agent shall have no duly or obligation to take any further action under any Collateral Document, including any
100
action required to maintain the perfection of any such security interest), and (b) the Required Lenders shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, provided that (i) all payments required to be made hereunder or under any other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Person other than the Administrative Agent shall be made directly to such Person and (ii) all notices and other communications required or contemplated to be given or made to the Administrative Agent shall also directly be given or made to each Lender. Following the effectiveness of the Administrative
Agent's
Agent’s
resignation from its capacity as such, the provisions of this Article, Section 2.18(d) and Section 9.03, as well as any exculpatory, reimbursement and indemnification provisions set forth in any other Loan Document, shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent and in respect of the matters referred to in the proviso under clause (a) above.

In its capacity, the Administrative Agent is a “
representative
” of the Secured Parties within the meaning of the term “
secured party
” as defined in the New York Uniform Commercial Code. Each Lender authorizes the Administrative Agent to enter into each of the Collateral Documents to which it is a party and to take all action contemplated by such documents. Each Lender agrees that no Secured Party (other than the Administrative Agent) shall have the right individually to seek to realize upon the security granted by any Collateral Document, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties upon the terms of the Collateral Documents. In the event that any Collateral is hereafter pledged by any Person as collateral security for the Secured Obligations, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, and hereby granted a power of attorney, to execute and deliver on behalf of the Secured Parties any Loan Documents necessary or appropriate to grant and perfect a Lien on such Collateral in favor of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties. The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the Administrative Agent upon any Collateral (i) as described in Section 9.02(c); (ii) as permitted by, but only in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Loan Document; or (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders, unless such release is required to be approved by all of the Lenders hereunder. Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s authority to release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant hereto.

102
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties herein or pursuant hereto upon the Collateral that was sold or transferred;
provided
,
however
, that (i) the Administrative Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in the Administrative Agent’s opinion, would expose the Administrative Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Secured Obligations or any Liens upon (or obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of) all interests retained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, including (without limitation) the proceeds of the sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral.
(c)
(c)
In case of the pendency of any proceeding with respect to any Loan Party under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
(i)
(i)
to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Secured Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim under Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.16, 2.17, 2.18 and 9.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
(ii)
(ii)
collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and each other Secured Party to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders or the other Secured Parties, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due to it, in its capacity as the Administrative Agent, under the Loan Documents (including under Section 9.03).
The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Secured Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the Secured Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Credit Party is subject, or (b) at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Secured Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Secured Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) for the asset or assets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection with such purchase). In connection with any such bid (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more
103
acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, (ii) each of the Secured Parties’ ratable interests in the Secured Obligations which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles (
provided
that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the governing documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required Lenders or their permitted assignees under the terms of this Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in Section 9.02 of this Agreement), (iv) the Administrative Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to each of the Secured Parties, ratably on account of the relevant Secured Obligations which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership, limited partnership interests or membership interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and/or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that Secured Obligations that are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Secured Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of Secured Obligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Secured Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Secured Parties pro rata and the equity interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of such Secured Obligations shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Secured Obligations of each Secured Party are deemed assigned to the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Party shall execute such documents and provide such information regarding the Secured Party (and/or any designee of the Secured Party which will receive interests in or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such credit bid.

Foreign Law.
The Borrower, on its behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries, and each Lender, on its behalf and on the behalf of its affiliated Secured Parties, hereby irrevocably constitute the Administrative Agent as the holder of an irrevocable power of attorney (
fondé de pouvoir
within the meaning of Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Québec) in order to hold hypothecs and security granted by the Borrower or any Subsidiary on property pursuant to the laws of the Province of Quebec to secure obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary under any bond, debenture or similar title of indebtedness issued by the Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement, and agree that the Administrative Agent may act as the bondholder and mandatary with respect to any bond, debenture or similar title of indebtedness that may be issued by the Borrower or any Subsidiary and pledged in favor of the Secured Parties in connection with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 32 of the An Act respecting the special powers of legal persons (Quebec), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent may acquire and be the holder of any bond issued by the Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement (i.e., the fondé de pouvoir may acquire and hold the first bond issued under any deed of hypothec by the Borrower or any Subsidiary).
The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to execute and deliver any documents necessary or appropriate to create and perfect the rights of pledge for the benefit of the Secured Parties including a right of pledge with respect to the entitlements to profits, the
104
balance left after winding up and the voting rights of the Borrower as ultimate parent of any subsidiary of the Borrower which is organized under the laws of the Netherlands and the Equity Interests of which are pledged in connection herewith (a “
Dutch Pledge
”). Without prejudice to the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree with the creation of parallel debt obligations of the Borrower or any relevant Subsidiary as will be described in any Dutch Pledge (the “
Parallel Debt
”), including that any payment received by the Administrative Agent in respect of the Parallel Debt will - conditionally upon such payment not subsequently being avoided or reduced by virtue of any provisions or enactments relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, preference, liquidation or similar laws of general application - be deemed a satisfaction of a pro rata portion of the corresponding amounts of the Obligations, and any payment to the Secured Parties in satisfaction of the Obligations shall - conditionally upon such payment not subsequently being avoided or reduced by virtue of any provisions or enactments relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, preference, liquidation or similar laws of general application - be deemed as satisfaction of the corresponding amount of the Parallel Debt. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of a Dutch Pledge, any resignation by the Administrative Agent is not effective until its rights under the Parallel Debt are assigned to the successor Administrative Agent.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree for the purposes of taking and ensuring the continuing validity of German law governed pledges (
Pfandrechte
) with the creation of parallel debt obligations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as will be further described in a separate German law governed parallel debt undertaking. The Administrative Agent shall (i) hold such parallel debt undertaking as fiduciary agent (
Treuhaender
) and (ii) administer and hold as fiduciary agent (
Treuhaender
) any pledge created under a German law governed Collateral Document which is created in favor of any Secured Party or transferred to any Secured Party due to its accessory nature (
Akzessorietaet
), in each case in its own name and for the account of the Secured Parties. Each Lender, on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliated Secured Parties, hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to enter as its agent in its name and on its behalf into any German law governed Collateral Document, to accept as its agent in its name and on its behalf any pledge under such Collateral Document and to agree to and execute as agent in its name and on its behalf any amendments, supplements and other alterations to any such Collateral Document and to release any such Collateral Document and any pledge created under any such Collateral Document in accordance with the provisions herein and/or the provisions in any such Collateral Document.
Each Secured Party hereby irrevocably appoints JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent on the terms and conditions set forth in any Collateral Document governed by English law to act as its trustee under and in relation to any Collateral Document governed by English law and to hold the assets subject to the security thereby created as trustee for the Secured Parties on the trusts and other terms contained in any Collateral Document governed by English law. Each Secured Party hereby irrevocably authorizes JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, to exercise such rights, remedies, powers and discretions as are specifically delegated to it by the terms of any Collateral Document governed by English law, together with all such rights, remedies, powers and discretions as are reasonably incidental thereto. Any reference in this Agreement to Liens or other security interests stated to be in favor of the Administrative Agent shall be construed so as to include a reference to Liens or other security interests granted in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent.
Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, (or any successor Administrative Agent in accordance with this Agreement) shall have, subject always to the provisions of any Collateral Document governed by English law, (a) all the powers of an absolute owner of the security constituted by the Collateral Document governed by English law and (b) all the rights, remedies and powers granted to it and be subject to all the obligations and
105
duties owed by it under the Collateral Document governed by English law and/or any of the Loan Documents.
The Secured Parties agree that at any time that the beneficiary of the Liens under any Collateral Document governed by English law shall be a Person other than the Administrative Agent, such other Person shall have the rights, remedies, benefits and powers granted to the Administrative Agent in this Agreement or in any Collateral Document governed by English law. Nothing in this Article VIII shall require JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, to act as a trustee at common law or to be holding any property on trust, in any jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom which may not operate under principles of trust or where such trust would not be recognized or its effects would not be enforceable.

However, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. reminds each Lender and Participant in the facility that, pursuant to the Flood Laws, each federally regulated Lender (whether acting as a Lender or Participant in the facility) is responsible for assuring its own compliance with the flood insurance requirements.

SECTION 9.02.
Waivers; Amendments.
- No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under any other Loan Document are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

provided
that no such agreement shall:
(i)
(i)
increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender;
provided
that, a waiver of any mandatory prepayment shall not constitute an increase of any Commitment of any Lender;
(ii)
(ii)
reduce or forgive the principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce or forgive any interest or fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;
provided

except as provided in
clauses (d)
and
(e)
of this Section or in any Collateral Document, release all or substantially all of the Collateral, without the written consent of each Lender;
provided

further
that (A) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (it being understood that any change to Section 2.26 shall require the consent of the Administrative Agent) and (B) any amendment or waiver that by its terms affects the rights or duties of Lenders holding Loans or Commitments of a particular Class (but not the Lenders holding Loans or Commitments of any other Class) will require only the requisite percentage in interest of the affected Class of Lenders that would be required to consent thereto if such Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders. The Administrative Agent may also amend
Schedule 2.01
to reflect assignments entered into pursuant to Section 9.04 and as set forth in Section 2.10(g).

(c)
The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its sole discretion, to release any Liens granted to the Administrative Agent by the Loan Parties on any Collateral (i) upon satisfaction of the Final Release Conditions, (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed of if the Loan Party disposing of such property certifies to the Administrative Agent that the sale or disposition is made in compliance with the terms of this Agreement (and the Administrative Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry), and to the extent that the property being sold or disposed of constitutes 100% of the Equity Interests of a Subsidiary, the Administrative Agent is authorized to release any Loan Guaranty, (iii) constituting property leased to a Loan Party under a lease which has expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement, (iv) constituting Excluded Assets, (v) as required to effect any sale or other disposition of such Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Article VII or (vi) as permitted by, but only in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Loan Document. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent will not release any Liens on Collateral without the prior written authorization of the Required Lenders;
provided
that, the Administrative Agent may in its discretion, release its Liens on Collateral valued in the aggregate not in excess of $5,000,000 during any calendar year without the prior written authorization of the Required Lenders (it being agreed that the Administrative Agent may rely conclusively on one or more certificates of the Borrower as to the value of any Collateral to be so released, without further inquiry). Any execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent of documents in connection with any such release shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent. In addition, each of the Lenders, on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates that are Secured Parties, irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its discretion, (i) to subordinate any Lien on any assets granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 6.02(d) or (ii) in the event that the Borrower shall have advised the Administrative Agent that, notwithstanding the use by the Borrower of commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such holder (but without the requirement to pay any sums to obtain such consent) to permit the Administrative Agent to retain its liens (on a subordinated basis as contemplated by clause (i) above), the holder of such other Indebtedness requires, as a condition to the extension of such credit, that the Liens on such assets granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document be released, to release the Administrative Agent’s Liens on such assets. Any such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of the Loan Parties in respect of) all interests retained by the Loan Parties, including the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral. Any execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent of documents in connection with any such release shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Administrative Agent.
(d)
If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of “
each Lender
” or “
each Lender directly affected thereby,
” the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is necessary but has not been obtained being referred to herein as a “
Non-Consenting Lender
”), then the Borrower may elect to replace a Non-Consenting Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement;
provided
that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to the Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Non-Consenting Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of clause (b) of Section 9.04, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Non-Consenting Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (1) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Non-Consenting Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and including the date of
111
termination, including without limitation payments due to such Non-Consenting Lender under Sections 2.15 and 2.17, and (2) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 2.17 had the Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed solely by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and that the Non-Consenting Lender shall be deemed to have agreed to such assignment and need not be a party thereto.
(e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein the Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Borrower only, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents (i) to correct, amend, resolve or cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency or correct any typographical error or other manifest error in any Loan Document, (ii) to comply with local law or advice of local counsel in any jurisdiction the laws of which govern any Collateral Document or that are relevant to the creation, perfection, protection and/or priority of any Lien in favor of the Administrative Agent, (iii) to effect the granting, perfection, protection, expansion or enhancement of any security interest in any Collateral or additional property to become Collateral for the benefit of the Secured Parties, (iv) to make administrative or operational changes not adverse to any Lender or (v) to add a guarantor or collateral or otherwise enhance the rights and benefits of the Lenders.
(f)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and any other Loan Document may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (x) to add one or more credit facilities (in addition to the Incremental Term Loans pursuant to an Incremental Amendment) to this Agreement and to permit extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Tranche B Term Loans, Incremental Term Loans and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (y) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders and Lenders.

provided
that the indemnity provided for in this
Section 9.03(b)
shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. This Section 9.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses or damages arising from any non-Tax claim.
(c)
To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount (it being understood that the Borrower’s failure to pay any such amount shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof);
provided
that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, penalty, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.
(d)

All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than fifteen (15) days after written demand therefor.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.
(iv)
(iv)
The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “
Register
”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(v)

115
required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register;
provided
that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.08(b), 2.19(d) or 9.03(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(vi)
(vi)
Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a “
Participant
”), other than an Ineligible Institution, in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged; (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.16, 2.17 and 2.18 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.18(f) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.18 shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.19 and 2.20 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.16 or 2.18, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.20(b) with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.19(d) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “
Participant Register
”);
provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under Treasury Regulations Section 5f.103-1(c) and Proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.163-5(b) (or any amended or successor version). The entries in the Participant Register shall be
116
conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(c)
Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

Further, the obligations of any Loan Guarantor hereunder are not discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by: (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy with respect to all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) any waiver or modification of or supplement to any provision of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any release, non-perfection, or invalidity of any indirect or direct security for the obligations of the Borrower for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any obligations of any other Obligated Party liable for any of the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) any action or failure to act by the Administrative Agent or any Lender with respect to any collateral securing any part of the Guaranteed

Obligations; or (v) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any other circumstance, act, omission or delay that might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of such Loan Guarantor or that would otherwise operate as a discharge of any Loan Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations).
SECTION 10.04.
SECTION 10.04.
Defenses Waived.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Loan Guarantor hereby waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower or any Loan Guarantor or the unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower, any Loan Guarantor or any other Obligated Party, other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Loan Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any person against any Obligated Party, or any other Person. Each Loan Guarantor confirms that it is not a surety under any state law and shall not raise any such law as a defense to its obligations hereunder. The Administrative Agent may, at its election, foreclose on any Collateral held by it by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such Collateral in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise act or fail to act with respect to any collateral securing all or a part of the Guaranteed Obligations, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Obligated Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to it against any Obligated Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of such Loan Guarantor under this Loan Guaranty except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully and indefeasibly paid in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Loan Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though that election may operate, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any Loan Guarantor against any Obligated Party or any security.
SECTION 10.05.
SECTION 10.05.
Rights of Subrogation.
No Loan Guarantor will assert any right, claim or cause of action, including, without limitation, a claim of subrogation, contribution or indemnification that it has against any Obligated Party, or any collateral, until the Loan Parties and the Loan Guarantors have fully performed all their obligations to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.
SECTION 10.06.
SECTION 10.06.
Reinstatement; Stay of Acceleration.
If at any time any payment of any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations (including a payment effected through exercise of a right of setoff) is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by a Secured Party in its discretion), each Loan Guarantor’s obligations under this Loan Guaranty with respect to that payment shall be reinstated at such time as though the payment had not been made and whether or not the Administrative Agent and the Lenders are in possession of this Loan Guaranty. If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations shall nonetheless be payable by the Loan Guarantors forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent.
SECTION 10.07.
SECTION 10.07.
Information.
Each Loan Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Borrower’s financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks that each Loan Guarantor assumes and
127
incurs under this Loan Guaranty, and agrees that none of the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall have any duty to advise any Loan Guarantor of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks.
SECTION 10.08.
SECTION 10.08.
Termination.
The Lenders may continue to make loans or extend credit to the Borrower based on this Loan Guaranty until five (5) days after it receives written notice of termination from any Loan Guarantor. Notwithstanding receipt of any such notice, each Loan Guarantor will continue to be liable to the Lenders for any Guaranteed Obligations created, assumed or committed to prior to the fifth day after receipt of the notice, and all subsequent renewals, extensions, modifications and amendments with respect to, or substitutions for, all or any part of that Guaranteed Obligations. Nothing in this Section 10.08 shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of, or eliminate, limit, reduce or otherwise impair any rights or remedies the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have in respect of, any Default or Event of Default that may exist under Article VII hereof as a result of any such notice of termination.
SECTION 10.09.
SECTION 10.09.
Taxes.
All payments of the Guaranteed Obligations will be made by each Loan Guarantor free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes;
provided
that if any Loan Guarantor shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Guarantor shall make such deductions and (iii) such Loan Guarantor shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
SECTION 10.10.
SECTION 10.10.
Maximum Liability.
The provisions of this Loan Guaranty are severable, and in any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, federal or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Loan Guarantor under this Loan Guaranty would otherwise be held or determined to be avoidable, invalid or unenforceable on account of the amount of such Loan Guarantor’s liability under this Loan Guaranty, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Loan Guaranty to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action by the Loan Guarantors or the Lenders, be automatically limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable as determined in such action or proceeding (such highest amount determined hereunder being the relevant Loan Guarantor’s “
Maximum Liability
”). This Section with respect to the Maximum Liability of each Loan Guarantor is intended solely to preserve the rights of the Lenders to the maximum extent not subject to avoidance under applicable law, and no Loan Guarantor nor any other person or entity shall have any right or claim under this Section with respect to such Maximum Liability, except to the extent necessary so that the obligations of any Loan Guarantor hereunder shall not be rendered voidable under applicable law. Each Loan Guarantor agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum Liability of each Loan Guarantor without impairing this Loan Guaranty or affecting the rights and remedies of the Lenders hereunder;
provided
that, nothing in this sentence shall be construed to increase any Loan Guarantor’s obligations hereunder beyond its Maximum Liability.
SECTION 10.11.
Maximum Liability
Maximum Liability
SECTION 10.10. Maximum Liability
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Loan Guaranty, the amount guaranteed by each Loan Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the extent, if any, required so that its obligations hereunder shall not be subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, Uniform Voidable Transaction Act or similar statute or common
128
law. In determining the limitations, if any, on the amount of any Loan Guarantor’s obligations hereunder pursuant to the preceding sentence, it is the intention of the parties hereto that any rights of subrogation, indemnification or contribution which such Loan Guarantor may have under this Loan Guaranty, any other agreement or applicable law shall be taken into account.
SECTION 10.12.
SECTION 10.12.
Contribution.
(a)
To the extent that any Loan Guarantor shall make a payment under this Loan Guaranty (a “
Guarantor Payment
”) which, taking into account all other Guarantor Payments then previously or concurrently made by any other Loan Guarantor, exceeds the amount which otherwise would have been paid by or attributable to such Loan Guarantor if each Loan Guarantor had paid the aggregate Guaranteed Obligations satisfied by such Guarantor Payment in the same proportion as such Loan Guarantor’s “Allocable Amount” (as defined below) (as determined immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment) bore to the aggregate Allocable Amounts of each of the Loan Guarantors as determined immediately prior to the making of such Guarantor Payment, then, following indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guarantor Payment and the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and the termination of this Agreement, such Loan Guarantor shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification payments from, and be reimbursed by, each other Loan Guarantor for the amount of such excess, pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment.
(b)
As of any date of determination, the “Allocable Amount” of any Loan Guarantor shall be equal to the excess of the fair saleable value of the property of such Loan Guarantor over the total liabilities of such Loan Guarantor (including the maximum amount reasonably expected to become due in respect of contingent liabilities, calculated, without duplication, assuming each other Loan Guarantor that is also liable for such contingent liability pays its ratable share thereof), giving effect to all payments made by other Loan Guarantors as of such date in a manner to maximize the amount of such contributions.
(c)
This Section 10.12 is intended only to define the relative rights of the Loan Guarantors, and nothing set forth in this Section 10.12 is intended to or shall impair the obligations of the Loan Guarantors, jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Loan Guaranty.
(d)
The parties hereto acknowledge that the rights of contribution and indemnification hereunder shall constitute assets of the Loan Guarantor or Loan Guarantors to which such contribution and indemnification is owing.
(e)
The rights of the indemnifying Loan Guarantors against other Loan Guarantors under this Section 10.12 shall be exercisable upon the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
SECTION 10.13.
SECTION 10.13.

Liability Cumulative.
The liability of each Loan Party as a Loan Guarantor under this Article X is in addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of each Loan Party to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which such Loan Party is a party or in respect of any obligations or liabilities of the other Loan Parties, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically provides to the contrary.

EXHIBIT H-1
[FORM OF] AUCTION PROCEDURES
This
Exhibit H-1
is intended to summarize certain basic terms of the reverse Dutch auction procedures pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of
Section 9.04(e)
of the Loan Agreement, of which this
Exhibit H-1
is a part. It is not intended to be a definitive statement of all of the terms and conditions of a reverse Dutch auction, the definitive terms and conditions for which shall be set forth in the applicable offering document. None of the Administrative Agent, the Auction Manager or any of their respective Affiliates makes any recommendation pursuant to any offering document as to whether or not any Lender should sell its Term Loans to a Purchasing Borrower Party pursuant to any offering documents, nor shall the decision by the Administrative Agent or the Auction Manager (or any of their respective Affiliates) in its capacity as a Lender to sell its Term Loans to a Purchasing Borrower Party be deemed to constitute such a recommendation. Each Lender should make its own decision as to whether to sell any of its Term Loans and as to the price to be sought for such Term Loans. In addition, each Lender should consult its own attorney, business advisor or tax advisor as to legal, business, tax and related matters concerning each Auction Purchase Offer and the relevant offering documents. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this
Exhibit H-1
have the meanings assigned to them in the Loan Agreement.

Notice Procedures
. In connection with each Auction Purchase Offer, a Purchasing Borrower Party will provide notification to the Auction Manager (for distribution to the Lenders) of the Class or Classes of Term Loans (as determined by such Purchasing Borrower Party in its sole discretion) that will be the subject of such Auction Purchase Offer (each, an “
Auction Notice
”). Each Auction Notice shall contain (i) the maximum principal amount (calculated on the face amount thereof) of each Class or Classes of Term Loans that the applicable Purchasing Borrower Party offers to purchase in such Auction Purchase Offer (the “
Auction Amount

”
“
), which shall be no less than $15,000,000 (across all such Classes); (ii) the range of discounts to par (the “
Discount Range
”), expressed as a range of prices (in increments of $25) per $1,000, at which such Purchasing Borrower Party would be willing to purchase Term Loans of each applicable Class in such Auction Purchase Offer; and (iii) the date on which such Auction Purchase Offer will conclude (which date shall not be less than three Business Days following the distribution of the Auction Notice to the Lenders of the applicable Class(es)), on which date Return Bids (as defined below) will be due by 1:00 p.m., New York City time (as such date and time may be extended by the Auction Manager, the “
Expiration Time
”). Such Expiration Time may be extended for a period not exceeding three (3) Business Days upon notice by the applicable Purchasing Borrower Party to the Auction Manager received not less than 24 hours before the original Expiration Time;
provided
that, only two (2) extensions per offer shall be permitted. An Auction Purchase Offer shall be regarded as a “
failed Auction Purchase Offer
” in the event that either (x) the applicable Purchasing Borrower Party withdraws such Auction Purchase Offer in accordance with the terms hereof or (y) the Expiration Time occurs with no Qualifying Bids (as defined below) having been received. In the event of a failed Auction Purchase Offer, no Purchasing Borrower Party shall be permitted to deliver a new Auction Notice prior to the date occurring three (3) Business Days after such withdrawal or Expiration Time, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the applicable Purchasing Borrower Party shall not initiate any Auction Purchase Offer by delivering an Auction Notice to the Auction Manager until after the conclusion (whether successful or failed) of the previous Auction Purchase Offer (if any), whether such conclusion occurs by withdrawal of such previous Auction Purchase Offer or the occurrence of the Expiration Time of such previous Auction Purchase Offer.

Reply Procedures
. In connection with any Auction Purchase Offer, each Lender of the applicable Class(es) wishing to participate in such Auction Purchase Offer shall, prior to the Expiration Time, provide the Auction Manager with a notice of participation, in the form
Exhibit F


included in the applicable offering document (each, a “
Return Bid
”) which shall specify (i) a discount to par that must be expressed as a price (in increments of $25) per $1,000 in principal amount of Term Loans (the “
Reply Price
”) of the applicable Class(es) within the Discount Range and (ii) the principal amount of Term Loans of the applicable Class(es), in an amount not less than $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that such Lender offers for sale at its Reply Price (the “
Reply Amount
”). A Lender may submit a Reply Amount that is less than the minimum amount and incremental amount requirements described above only if the Reply Amount comprises the entire amount of the Term Loans of the applicable Class(es) held by such Lender. Lenders may only submit one Return Bid per Class per Auction Purchase Offer, but each Return Bid may contain up to three component bids, each of which may result in a separate Qualifying Bid and each of which will not be contingent on any other component bid submitted by such Lender resulting in a Qualifying Bid. In addition to the Return Bid, the participating Lender must execute and deliver, to be held in escrow by the Auction Manager, an Affiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption. No Purchasing Borrower Party will purchase any Term Loans at a price that is outside of the applicable Discount Range, nor will any Return Bids (including any component bids specified therein) submitted at a price that is outside such applicable Discount Range be considered in any calculation of the Applicable Discounted Price (as defined below).

Acceptance Procedures
. Based on the Reply Prices and Reply Amounts received by the Auction Manager, the Auction Manager, in consultation with the applicable Purchasing Borrower Party, will determine the applicable discounted price (the “
Applicable Discounted Price
”) for the Auction, which will be (i) the lowest Reply Price for which such Purchasing Borrower Party can complete the Auction Purchase Offer at the Auction Amount or (ii) in the event that the aggregate amount of the Reply Amounts relating to such Auction Notice is insufficient to allow such Purchasing Borrower Party to purchase the entire Auction Amount, the highest Reply Price that is within the Discounted Range, so that such Purchasing Borrower Party can complete the purchase at such aggregate amount of Reply Amounts. Subject to the conditions contained in the Auction Notice, the applicable Purchasing Borrower Party shall purchase the Term Loans (or the respective portions thereof) from each Lender with a Reply Price that is equal to or less than the Applicable Discounted Price (“
Qualifying Bids
”) at the Applicable Discounted Price; provided that if the aggregate amount required to pay the Qualifying Bids would exceed the Auction Amount for such Auction Purchase Offer, such Purchasing Borrower Party shall pay such Qualifying Bids at the Applicable Discounted Price ratably based on the respective principal amounts of such Qualifying Bids (subject to rounding requirements specified by the Auction Manager). Each participating Term Lender shall be given notice as to whether its bid is a Qualifying Bid as soon as reasonably practicable but in no case later than five (5) Business Days from the date the Return Bid was due.

Notification Procedures
. The Auction Manager will calculate the Applicable Discounted Price and will cause the Administrative Agent to post the Applicable Discounted Price and proration factor, if applicable, onto an internet or intranet site (including an IntraLinks, SyndTrak or other electronic workspace) in accordance with the Auction Manager’s standard dissemination practices by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day during which the Expiration Time occurs. The Auction Manager will insert the principal amount of Term Loans of the applicable Class(es) to be assigned and the applicable settlement date into each applicable Affiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption received in connection with a Qualifying Bid. Upon the request of any submitting Lender, the Auction Manager will promptly return any Affiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption received in connection with a Return Bid that is not a Qualifying Bid.

Additional Procedures
. After delivery of an Auction Notice, the applicable Purchasing Borrower Party may withdraw an Auction Purchase Offer only if no Qualifying Bid has been received by the Auction Manager at the time of withdrawal. Any Return Bid (including any component bid thereof) delivered to the Auction Manager may not be withdrawn, modified, revoked, terminated or cancelled by a Lender. However, an Auction Purchase Offer may become void if the conditions to the purchase set forth in
Section 9.04(e)
of the Loan Agreement

are not met. The purchase price in respect of each Qualifying Bid for which purchase by the applicable Purchasing Borrower Party is required in accordance with the foregoing provisions shall be paid directly by such Purchasing Borrower Party to the respective assigning Lender on a settlement date as determined jointly by such Purchasing Borrower Party and the Auction Manager (which shall be not later than ten Business Days after the date Return Bids are due). The applicable Purchasing Borrower Party shall execute each applicable Affiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption received in connection with a Qualifying Bid. All questions as to the form of documents and eligibility of Term Loans that are the subject of an Auction Purchase Offer will be determined by the Auction Manager, in consultation with the applicable Purchasing Borrower Party, and their determination will be final and binding so long as such determination is not inconsistent with the terms of
Section 9.04(e)
of the Loan Agreement or this
Exhibit H-1
. The Auction Manager’s interpretation of the terms and conditions of the offering document, in consultation with the applicable Purchasing Borrower Party, will be final and binding so long as such interpretation is not inconsistent with the terms of
Section 9.04(e)
of the Loan Agreement or this
Exhibit H-1
. None of the Administrative Agent, the Auction Manager or any of their respective Affiliates assumes any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information concerning the applicable Purchasing Borrower Party, the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates (whether contained in an offering document or otherwise) or for any failure to disclose events that may have occurred and may affect the significance or accuracy of such information. This
Exhibit H-1
shall not require any Purchasing Borrower Party to initiate any Auction Purchase Offer.
