all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances; (iii) the Class A Ordinary Shares shall be listed or quoted for trading on NYSE or Nasdaq;

Investor will then have up to five (5) calendar days to elect to purchase up to thirty percent (30%) of the amount of debt or equity securities issued in such transaction on the most favorable terms and conditions offered to any other purchaser of the same securities. The parties agree that in the event Company breaches its obligations with respect to the Participation Right, Investor’s sole and exclusive remedy shall be to receive, as liquidated damages, an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the amount Investor would have been entitled to invest under the Participation Right. For the avoidance of doubt, Company’s breach of its obligations with respect to the Participation Right will not be considered a Trigger Event (as defined in the Note) under the Note.

9. Most Favored Nation . So long as the Note is outstanding, upon any issuance by Company of any security with any economic term or condition more favorable to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that was not similarly provided to Investor in the Transaction Documents, then Company shall notify Investor of such additional or more favorable economic term and such term, at Investor’s option, shall become a part of the Transaction Documents for the benefit of Investor. Additionally, if Company fails to notify Investor of any such additional or more favorable term, but Investor becomes aware that Company has granted such a term to any third party, Investor may notify Company of such additional or more favorable term and such term shall become a part of the Transaction Documents retroactive to the date on which such term was granted to the applicable third party. The types of economic terms contained in another security that may be more favorable to the holder of such security include, but are not limited to, terms addressing conversion discounts, conversion lookback periods, interest rates, original issue discounts, stock sale price, conversion price per share, warrant coverage, warrant exercise price, and anti-dilution/conversion and exercise price resets.

Exhibit E

ARBITRATION PROVISIONS

1. Dispute Resolution . For purposes of this Exhibit E , the term “ Claims ” means any disputes, claims, demands, causes of action, requests for injunctive relief, requests for specific performance, questions regarding severability of any provisions of the Transaction Documents, liabilities, damages, losses, or controversies whatsoever arising from, related to, or connected with the transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents and any communications between the parties related thereto, including without limitation any claims of mutual mistake, mistake, fraud, misrepresentation, failure of formation, failure of consideration, promissory estoppel, unconscionability, failure of condition precedent, rescission, and any statutory claims, tort claims, contract claims, or claims to void, invalidate or terminate the Agreement (or these Arbitration Provisions (defined below)) or any of the other Transaction Documents. The term “Claims” specifically excludes a dispute over Calculations. The parties to this Agreement (the “ parties ”) hereby agree that the Claims may be arbitrated in one or more Arbitrations pursuant to these Arbitration Provisions (one for an injunction or injunctions and a separate one for all other Claims). The parties hereby agree that the arbitration provisions set forth in this Exhibit E

(“ Arbitration Provisions ”) are binding on each of them. As a result, any attempt to rescind the Agreement (or these Arbitration Provisions) or any other Transaction Document) or declare the Agreement (or these Arbitration Provisions) or any other Transaction Document invalid or unenforceable pursuant to Section 29 of the 1934 Act or for any other reason is subject to these Arbitration Provisions. These Arbitration Provisions shall also survive any termination or expiration of the Agreement. Any capitalized term not defined in these Arbitration Provisions shall have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.

2. Arbitration . Except as otherwise provided herein, all Claims must be submitted to arbitration (“ Arbitration ”) to be conducted exclusively in Salt Lake County, Utah and pursuant to the terms set forth in these Arbitration Provisions. Subject to the arbitration appeal right provided for in Paragraph 5 below (the “ Appeal Right ”), the parties agree that the award of the arbitrator rendered pursuant to Paragraph 4 below (the “ Arbitration Award ”) shall be (a) final and binding upon the parties, (b) the sole and exclusive remedy between them regarding any Claims, counterclaims, issues, or accountings presented or pleaded to the arbitrator, and (c) promptly payable in United States dollars free of any tax, deduction or offset (with respect to monetary awards). Subject to the Appeal Right, any costs or fees, including without limitation attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with or incident to enforcing the Arbitration Award shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, be charged against the party resisting such enforcement. The Arbitration Award shall include default interest (as defined or otherwise provided for in the Note, “ Default Interest ”) (with respect to monetary awards) at the rate specified in the Note for Default Interest both before and after the Arbitration Award. Judgment upon the Arbitration Award will be entered and enforced by any state or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah.

3. The Arbitration Act . The parties hereby incorporate herein the provisions and procedures set forth in the Utah Uniform Arbitration Act, U.C.A. § 78B-11-101 et seq. (as amended or superseded from time to time, the “ Arbitration Act ”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to, and to the maximum extent permitted by, Section 105 of the Arbitration Act, in the event of conflict or variation between the terms of these Arbitration Provisions and the provisions of the Arbitration Act, the terms of these Arbitration Provisions shall control and the parties hereby waive or otherwise agree to vary the effect of all requirements of the Arbitration Act that may conflict with or vary from these Arbitration Provisions.

4. Arbitration Proceedings . Arbitration between the parties will be subject to the following:

4.1 Initiation of Arbitration . Pursuant to Section 110 of the Arbitration Act, the parties agree that a party may initiate Arbitration by giving written notice to the other party (“ Arbitration Notice ”) in the same manner that notice is permitted under Section 11.10 of the Agreement; provided, however , that the Arbitration Notice may not be given by email or fax. Arbitration will be deemed initiated as of the date that the Arbitration Notice is deemed delivered to such other party under Section 11.10 of the Agreement (the “ Service Date ”). After the Service Date, information may be delivered, and notices may be given, by email or fax pursuant to Section 11.10 of the Agreement or any other method permitted thereunder. The Arbitration Notice must describe the nature of the controversy, the remedies sought, and the election to commence Arbitration proceedings. All Claims in the Arbitration Notice must be pleaded consistent with the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.

[[/TABLE]]

4.2 Selection and Payment of Arbitrator .

- Within ten (10) calendar
days after the Service Date, Investor shall select and submit to Company the names of three (3) arbitrators that are designated as “neutrals”
or qualified arbitrators by Utah ADR Services (http://www.utahadrservices.com) (such three (3) designated persons hereunder are referred
to herein as the “
Proposed Arbitrators
”). For the avoidance of doubt, each Proposed Arbitrator must be qualified as
a “neutral” with Utah ADR Services. Within five (5) calendar days after Investor has submitted to Company the names of the
Proposed Arbitrators, Company must select, by written notice to Investor, one (1) of the Proposed Arbitrators to act as the arbitrator
for the parties under these Arbitration Provisions. If Company fails to select one of the Proposed Arbitrators in writing within such
5-day period, then Investor may select the arbitrator from the Proposed Arbitrators by providing written notice of such selection to Company.

- If Investor fails
to submit to Company the Proposed Arbitrators within ten (10) calendar days after the Service Date pursuant to subparagraph (a) above,
then Company may at any time prior to Investor so designating the Proposed Arbitrators, identify the names of three (3) arbitrators that
are designated as “neutrals” or qualified arbitrators by Utah ADR Service by written notice to Investor. Investor may then,
within five (5) calendar days after Company has submitted notice of its Proposed Arbitrators to Investor, select, by written notice to
Company, one (1) of the Proposed Arbitrators to act as the arbitrator for the parties under these Arbitration Provisions. If Investor
fails to select in writing and within such 5-day period one (1) of the three (3) Proposed Arbitrators selected by Company, then Company
may select the arbitrator from its three (3) previously selected Proposed Arbitrators by providing written notice of such selection to
Investor.

- If a Proposed Arbitrator
chosen to serve as arbitrator declines or is otherwise unable to serve as arbitrator, then the party that selected such Proposed Arbitrator
may select one (1) of the other three (3) Proposed Arbitrators within three (3) calendar days of the date the chosen Proposed Arbitrator
declines or notifies the parties he or she is unable to serve as arbitrator. If all three (3) Proposed Arbitrators decline or are otherwise
unable to serve as arbitrator, then the arbitrator selection process shall begin again in accordance with this Paragraph 4.2.

- The date that the
Proposed Arbitrator selected pursuant to this Paragraph 4.2 agrees in writing (including via email) delivered to both parties to serve
as the arbitrator hereunder is referred to herein as the “
Arbitration Commencement Date
”. If an arbitrator resigns
or is unable to act during the Arbitration, a replacement arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with this Paragraph 4.2 to continue
the Arbitration. If Utah ADR Services ceases to exist or to provide a list of neutrals and there is no successor thereto, then the arbitrator
shall be selected under the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association.

- Subject to Paragraph
4.10 below, the cost of the arbitrator must be paid equally by both parties. Subject to Paragraph 4.10 below, if one party refuses or
fails to pay its portion of the arbitrator fee, then the other party can advance such unpaid amount (subject to the accrual of Default
Interest thereupon), with such amount being added to or subtracted from, as applicable, the Arbitration Award.

4.3 Applicability of Certain Utah Rules . The parties agree that the Arbitration shall be conducted generally in accordance with the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure and the Utah Rules of Evidence. More specifically, the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply, without limitation, to the filing of any pleadings, motions or memoranda, the conducting of discovery, and the taking of any depositions. The Utah Rules of Evidence shall apply to any hearings, whether telephonic or in person, held by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the parties’ intent that the incorporation of such rules will in no event supersede these Arbitration Provisions. In the event of any conflict between the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure or the Utah Rules of Evidence and these Arbitration Provisions, these Arbitration Provisions shall control.

4.4 Answer and Default . An answer and any counterclaims to the Arbitration Notice shall be required to be delivered to the party initiating the Arbitration within twenty (20) calendar days after the Arbitration Commencement Date. If an answer is not delivered by the required deadline, the arbitrator must provide written notice to the defaulting party stating that the arbitrator will enter a default award against such party if such party does not file an answer within five (5) calendar days of receipt of such notice. If an answer is not filed within the five (5) day extension period, the arbitrator must render a default award, consistent with the relief requested in the Arbitration Notice, against a party that fails to submit an answer within such time period.

4.5 Related Litigation . The party that delivers the Arbitration Notice to the other party shall have the option to also commence concurrent legal proceedings with any state or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah (“ Litigation Proceedings ”), subject to the following: (a) the complaint in the Litigation Proceedings is to be substantially similar to the claims set forth in the Arbitration Notice, provided that an additional cause of action to compel arbitration will also be included therein, (b) so long as the other party files an answer to the complaint in the Litigation Proceedings and an answer to the Arbitration Notice, the Litigation Proceedings will be stayed pending an Arbitration Award (or Appeal Panel Award (defined below), as applicable) hereunder, (c) if the other party fails to file an answer in the Litigation Proceedings or an answer in the Arbitration proceedings, then the party initiating Arbitration shall be entitled to a default judgment consistent with the relief requested, to be entered in the Litigation Proceedings, and (d) any legal or procedural issue arising under the Arbitration Act that requires a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction may be determined in the Litigation Proceedings. Any award of the arbitrator (or of the Appeal Panel (defined below)) may be entered in such Litigation Proceedings pursuant to the Arbitration Act.

[[/TABLE]]

4.6 Discovery . Pursuant to Section 118(8) of the Arbitration Act, the parties agree that discovery shall be conducted as follows:

- Written discovery
will only be allowed if the likely benefits of the proposed written discovery outweigh the burden or expense thereof, and the written
discovery sought is likely to reveal information that will satisfy a specific element of a claim or defense already pleaded in the Arbitration.
The party seeking written discovery shall always have the burden of showing that all of the standards and limitations set forth in these
Arbitration Provisions are satisfied. The scope of discovery in the Arbitration proceedings shall also be limited as follows:

- To
facts directly connected with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

- To
facts and information that cannot be obtained from another source or in another manner that is more convenient, less burdensome or less
expensive than in the manner requested.

- No party shall be
allowed (i) more than fifteen (15) interrogatories (including discrete subparts), (ii) more than fifteen (15) requests for admission (including
discrete subparts), (iii) more than ten (10) document requests (including discrete subparts), or (iv) more than three (3) depositions
(excluding expert depositions) for a maximum of seven (7) hours per deposition. The costs associated with depositions will be borne by
the party taking the deposition. The party defending the deposition will submit a notice to the party taking the deposition of the estimated
attorneys’ fees that such party expects to incur in connection with defending the deposition. If the party defending the deposition
fails to submit an estimate of attorneys’ fees within five (5) calendar days of its receipt of a deposition notice, then such party
shall be deemed to have waived its right to the estimated attorneys’ fees. The party taking the deposition must pay the party defending
the deposition the estimated attorneys’ fees prior to taking the deposition, unless such obligation is deemed to be waived as set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence. If the party taking the deposition believes that the estimated attorneys’ fees are
unreasonable, such party may submit the issue to the arbitrator for a decision. All depositions will be taken in Utah.

- All discovery requests
(including document production requests included in deposition notices) must be submitted in writing to the arbitrator and the other party.
The party submitting the written discovery requests must include with such discovery requests a detailed explanation of how the proposed
discovery requests satisfy the requirements of these Arbitration Provisions and the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. The receiving party
will then be allowed, within five (5) calendar days of receiving the proposed discovery requests, to submit to the arbitrator an estimate
of the attorneys’ fees and costs associated with responding to such written discovery requests and a written challenge to each applicable
discovery request. After receipt of an estimate of attorneys’ fees and costs and/or challenge(s) to one or more discovery requests,
consistent with subparagraph (c) above, the arbitrator will within three (3) calendar days make a finding as to the likely attorneys’
fees and costs associated with responding to the discovery requests and issue an order that (i) requires the requesting party to prepay
the attorneys’ fees and costs associated with responding to the discovery requests, and (ii) requires the responding party to respond
to the discovery requests as limited by the arbitrator within twenty-five (25) calendar days of the arbitrator’s finding with respect
to such discovery requests. If a party entitled to submit an estimate of attorneys’ fees and costs and/or a challenge to discovery
requests fails to do so within such 5-day period, the arbitrator will make a finding that (A) there are no attorneys’ fees or costs
associated with responding to such discovery requests, and (B) the responding party must respond to such discovery requests (as may be
limited by the arbitrator) within twenty-five (25) calendar days of the arbitrator’s finding with respect to such discovery requests.
Any party submitting any written discovery requests, including without limitation interrogatories, requests for production subpoenas to
a party or a third party, or requests for admissions, must prepay the estimated attorneys’ fees and costs, before the responding
party has any obligation to produce or respond to the same, unless such obligation is deemed waived as set forth above.

- In order to allow
a written discovery request, the arbitrator must find that the discovery request satisfies the standards set forth in these Arbitration
Provisions and the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitrator must strictly enforce these standards. If a discovery request does not
satisfy any of the standards set forth in these Arbitration Provisions or the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, the arbitrator may modify
such discovery request to satisfy the applicable standards, or strike such discovery request in whole or in part.

- Each party may submit
expert reports (and rebuttals thereto), provided that such reports must be submitted within sixty (60) days of the Arbitration Commencement
Date. Each party will be allowed a maximum of two (2) experts. Expert reports must contain the following: (i) a complete statement of
all opinions the expert will offer at trial and the basis and reasons for them; (ii) the expert’s name and qualifications, including
a list of all the expert’s publications within the preceding ten (10) years, and a list of any other cases in which the expert has
testified at trial or in a deposition or prepared a report within the preceding ten (10) years; and (iii) the compensation to be paid
for the expert’s report and testimony. The parties are entitled to depose any other party’s expert witness one (1) time for
no more than four (4) hours. An expert may not testify in a party’s case-in-chief concerning any matter not fairly disclosed in
the expert report.

[[/TABLE]]

4.6
Dispositive
Motions
. Each party shall have the right to submit dispositive motions pursuant Rule 12 or Rule 56 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure
(a “
Dispositive Motion
”). The party submitting the Dispositive Motion may, but is not required to, deliver to the arbitrator
and to the other party a memorandum in support (the “
Memorandum in Support
”) of the Dispositive Motion. Within seven
- calendar days of delivery of the Memorandum in Support, the other party shall deliver to the arbitrator and to the other party a memorandum
in opposition to the Memorandum in Support (the “
Memorandum in Opposition
”). Within seven (7) calendar days of delivery
of the Memorandum in Opposition, as applicable, the party that submitted the Memorandum in Support shall deliver to the arbitrator and
to the other party a reply memorandum to the Memorandum in Opposition (“
Reply Memorandum
”). If the applicable party
shall fail to deliver the Memorandum in Opposition as required above, or if the other party fails to deliver the Reply Memorandum as required
above, then the applicable party shall lose its right to so deliver the same, and the Dispositive Motion shall proceed regardless.

4.7 Confidentiality . All information disclosed by either party (or such party’s agents) during the Arbitration process (including without limitation information disclosed during the discovery process or any Appeal (defined below)) shall be considered confidential in nature. Each party agrees not to disclose any confidential information received from the other party (or its agents) during the Arbitration process (including without limitation during the discovery process or any Appeal) unless (a) prior to or after the time of disclosure such information becomes public knowledge or part of the public domain, not as a result of any inaction or action of the receiving party or its agents, (b) such information is required by a court order, subpoena or similar legal duress to be disclosed if such receiving party has notified the other party thereof in writing and given it a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order from a court of competent jurisdiction prior to disclosure, or (c) such information is disclosed to the receiving party’s agents, representatives and legal counsel on a need to know basis who each agree in writing not to disclose such information to any third party. Pursuant to Section 118(5) of the Arbitration Act, the arbitrator is hereby authorized and directed to issue a protective order to prevent the disclosure of privileged information and confidential information upon the written request of either party.

4.8 Authorization; Timing; Scheduling Order . Subject to all other portions of these Arbitration Provisions, the parties hereby authorize and direct the arbitrator to take such actions and make such rulings as may be necessary to carry out the parties’ intent for the Arbitration proceedings to be efficient and expeditious. Pursuant to Section 120 of the Arbitration Act, the parties hereby agree that an Arbitration Award must be made within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after the Arbitration Commencement Date. The arbitrator is hereby authorized and directed to hold a scheduling conference within ten (10) calendar days after the Arbitration Commencement Date in order to establish a scheduling order with various binding deadlines for discovery, expert testimony, and the submission of documents by the parties to enable the arbitrator to render a decision prior to the end of such 120-day period.

4.9 Relief . The arbitrator shall have the right to award or include in the Arbitration Award (or in a preliminary ruling) any relief which the arbitrator deems proper under the circumstances, including, without limitation, specific performance and injunctive relief, provided that the arbitrator may not award exemplary or punitive damages.

4.10
Fees
and Costs
. As part of the Arbitration Award, the arbitrator is hereby directed to require the losing party (the party being awarded
the least amount of money by the arbitrator, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be determined without regard to any statutory fines,
penalties, fees, or other charges awarded to any party) to (a) pay the full amount of any unpaid costs and fees of the Arbitration, and
- reimburse the prevailing party for all reasonable attorneys’ fees, arbitrator costs and fees, deposition costs, other discovery
costs, and other expenses, costs or fees paid or otherwise incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the Arbitration.

5. Arbitration Appeal .

5.1 Initiation of Appeal. Following the entry of the Arbitration Award, either party (the “ Appellant ”) shall have a period of thirty (30) calendar days in which to notify the other party (the “ Appellee ”), in writing, that the Appellant elects to appeal (the “ Appeal ”) the Arbitration Award (such notice, an “ Appeal Notice ”) to a panel of arbitrators as provided in Paragraph 5.2 below. The date the Appellant delivers an Appeal Notice to the Appellee is referred to herein as the “ Appeal Date ”. The Appeal Notice must be delivered to the Appellee in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 4.1 above with respect to delivery of an Arbitration Notice. In addition, together with delivery of the Appeal Notice to the Appellee, the Appellant must also pay for (and provide proof of such payment to the Appellee together with delivery of the Appeal Notice) a bond in the amount of 110% of the sum the Appellant owes to the Appellee as a result of the Arbitration Award the Appellant is appealing. In the event an Appellant delivers an Appeal Notice to the Appellee (together with proof of payment of the applicable bond) in compliance with the provisions of this Paragraph 5.1, the Appeal will occur as a matter of right and, except as specifically set forth herein, will not be further conditioned. In the event a party does not deliver an Appeal Notice (along with proof of payment of the applicable bond) to the other party within the deadline prescribed in this Paragraph 5.1, such party shall lose its right to appeal the Arbitration Award. If no party delivers an Appeal Notice (along with proof of payment of the applicable bond) to the other party within the deadline described in this Paragraph 5.1, the Arbitration Award shall be final. The parties acknowledge and agree that any Appeal shall be deemed part of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate for purposes of these Arbitration Provisions and the Arbitration Act.

5.2 Selection and Payment of Appeal Panel. In the event an Appellant delivers an Appeal Notice to the Appellee (together with proof of payment of the applicable bond) in compliance with the provisions of Paragraph 5.1 above, the Appeal will be heard by a three (3) person arbitration panel (the “ Appeal Panel ”).

- Within ten (10)
calendar days after the Appeal Date, the Appellee shall select and submit to the Appellant the names of five (5) arbitrators that are
designated as “neutrals” or qualified arbitrators by Utah ADR Services (http://www.utahadrservices.com) (such five (5) designated
persons hereunder are referred to herein as the “
Proposed Appeal Arbitrators
”). For the avoidance of doubt, each Proposed
Appeal Arbitrator must be qualified as a “neutral” with Utah ADR Services, and shall not be the arbitrator who rendered the
Arbitration Award being appealed (the “
Original Arbitrator
”). Within five (5) calendar days after the Appellee has
submitted to the Appellant the names of the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators, the Appellant must select, by written notice to the Appellee,
three (3) of the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators to act as the members of the Appeal Panel. If the Appellant fails to select three (3) of
the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators in writing within such 5-day period, then the Appellee may select such three (3) arbitrators from the
Proposed Appeal Arbitrators by providing written notice of such selection to the Appellant.

- If the Appellee
fails to submit to the Appellant the names of the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators within ten (10) calendar days after the Appeal Date pursuant
to subparagraph (a) above, then the Appellant may at any time prior to the Appellee so designating the Proposed Appeal Arbitrators, identify
the names of five (5) arbitrators that are designated as “neutrals” or qualified arbitrators by Utah ADR Service (none of
whom may be the Original Arbitrator) by written notice to the Appellee. The Appellee may then, within five (5) calendar days after the
Appellant has submitted notice of its selected arbitrators to the Appellee, select, by written notice to the Appellant, three (3) of such
selected arbitrators to serve on the Appeal Panel. If the Appellee fails to select in writing within such 5-day period three (3) of the
arbitrators selected by the Appellant to serve as the members of the Appeal Panel, then the Appellant may select the three (3) members
of the Appeal Panel from the Appellant’s list of five (5) arbitrators by providing written notice of such selection to the Appellee.

- If a selected
Proposed Appeal Arbitrator declines or is otherwise unable to serve, then the party that selected such Proposed Appeal Arbitrator may
select one (1) of the other five (5) designated Proposed Appeal Arbitrators within three (3) calendar days of the date a chosen Proposed
Appeal Arbitrator declines or notifies the parties he or she is unable to serve as an arbitrator. If at least three (3) of the five (5)
designated Proposed Appeal Arbitrators decline or are otherwise unable to serve, then the Proposed Appeal Arbitrator selection process
shall begin again in accordance with this Paragraph 5.2;
provided, however
, that any Proposed Appeal Arbitrators who have already
agreed to serve shall remain on the Appeal Panel.

- The date that
all three (3) Proposed Appeal Arbitrators selected pursuant to this Paragraph 5.2 agree in writing (including via email) delivered to
both the Appellant and the Appellee to serve as members of the Appeal Panel hereunder is referred to herein as the “

”. No later than five (5) calendar days after the Appeal Commencement Date, the Appellee shall designate in writing (including
via email) to the Appellant and the Appeal Panel the name of one (1) of the three (3) members of the Appeal Panel to serve as the lead
arbitrator in the Appeal proceedings. Each member of the Appeal Panel shall be deemed an arbitrator for purposes of these Arbitration
Provisions and the Arbitration Act, provided that, in conducting the Appeal, the Appeal Panel may only act or make determinations upon
the approval or vote of no less than the majority vote of its members, as announced or communicated by the lead arbitrator on the Appeal
Panel.
If an arbitrator on the Appeal Panel ceases or is unable to act during the Appeal proceedings,
a replacement arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with Paragraph 5.2 above to continue the Appeal as a member of the Appeal Panel.

If Utah ADR Services ceases to exist or to provide a list of neutrals, then the arbitrators for the Appeal Panel shall be selected under the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association.

- Subject to Paragraph
5.7 below, the cost of the Appeal Panel must be paid entirely by the Appellant.

5.3 Appeal Procedure. The Appeal will be deemed an appeal of the entire Arbitration Award. In conducting the Appeal, the Appeal Panel shall conduct a de novo review of all Claims described or otherwise set forth in the Arbitration Notice. Subject to the foregoing and all other provisions of this Paragraph 5, the Appeal Panel shall conduct the Appeal in a manner the Appeal Panel considers appropriate for a fair and expeditious disposition of the Appeal, may hold one or more hearings and permit oral argument, and may review all previous evidence and discovery, together with all briefs, pleadings and other documents filed with the Original Arbitrator (as well as any documents filed with the Appeal Panel pursuant to Paragraph 5.4(a) below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the Appeal, the Appeal Panel shall not permit the parties to conduct any additional discovery or raise any new Claims to be arbitrated, shall not permit new witnesses or affidavits, and shall not base any of its findings or determinations on the Original Arbitrator’s findings or the Arbitration Award.

5.4 Timing.

- Within
seven (7) calendar days of the Appeal Commencement Date, the Appellant (i) shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Appeal Panel
copies of the Appeal Notice, all discovery conducted in connection with the Arbitration, and all briefs, pleadings and other documents
filed with the Original Arbitrator (which material Appellee shall have the right to review and supplement if necessary), and (ii) may,
but is not required to, deliver to the Appeal Panel and to the Appellee a Memorandum in Support of the Appellant’s arguments concerning
or position with respect to all Claims, counterclaims, issues, or accountings presented or pleaded in the Arbitration. Within seven (7)
calendar days of the Appellant’s delivery of the Memorandum in Support, as applicable, the Appellee shall deliver to the Appeal
Panel and to the Appellant a Memorandum in Opposition to the Memorandum in Support. Within seven (7) calendar days of the Appellee’s
delivery of the Memorandum in Opposition, as applicable, the Appellant shall deliver to the Appeal Panel and to the Appellee a Reply Memorandum
to the Memorandum in Opposition. If the Appellant shall fail to substantially comply with the requirements of clause (i) of this subparagraph
(a), the Appellant shall lose its right to appeal the Arbitration Award, and the Arbitration Award shall be final. If the Appellee shall
fail to deliver the Memorandum in Opposition as required above, or if the Appellant shall fail to deliver the Reply Memorandum as required
above, then the Appellee or the Appellant, as the case may be, shall lose its right to so deliver the same, and the Appeal shall proceed
regardless.

- Subject
to subparagraph (a) above, the parties hereby agree that the Appeal must be heard by the Appeal Panel within thirty (30) calendar days
of the Appeal Commencement Date, and that the Appeal Panel must render its decision within thirty (30) calendar days after the Appeal
is heard (and in no event later than sixty (60) calendar days after the Appeal Commencement Date).

5.5 Appeal Panel Award. The Appeal Panel shall issue its decision (the “ Appeal Panel Award ”) through the lead arbitrator on the Appeal Panel. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, the Appeal Panel Award shall (a) supersede in its entirety and make of no further force or effect the Arbitration Award (provided that any protective orders issued by the Original Arbitrator shall remain in full force and effect), (b) be final and binding upon the parties, with no further rights of appeal, (c) be the sole and exclusive remedy between the parties regarding any Claims, counterclaims, issues, or accountings presented or pleaded in the Arbitration, and (d) be promptly payable in United States dollars free of any tax, deduction or offset (with respect to monetary awards). Any costs or fees, including without limitation attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with or incident to enforcing the Appeal Panel Award shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, be charged against the party resisting such enforcement. The Appeal Panel Award shall include Default Interest (with respect to monetary awards) at the rate specified in the Note for Default Interest both before and after the Arbitration Award. Judgment upon the Appeal Panel Award will be entered and enforced by a state or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah.

5.6 Relief.

The Appeal Panel shall have the right to award or include in the Appeal Panel Award any relief which the Appeal Panel deems proper under the circumstances, including, without limitation, specific performance and injunctive relief, provided that the Appeal Panel may not award exemplary or punitive damages.

5.7 Fees and Costs. As part of the Appeal Panel Award, the Appeal Panel is hereby directed to require the losing party (the party being awarded the least amount of money by the arbitrator, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be determined without regard to any statutory fines, penalties, fees, or other charges awarded to any party) to (a) pay the full amount of any unpaid costs and fees of the Arbitration and the Appeal Panel, and (b) reimburse the prevailing party (the party being awarded the most amount of money by the Appeal Panel, which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be determined without regard to any statutory fines, penalties, fees, or other charges awarded to any part) the reasonable attorneys’ fees, arbitrator and Appeal Panel costs and fees, deposition costs, other discovery costs, and other expenses, costs or fees paid or otherwise incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the Arbitration (including without limitation in connection with the Appeal).
