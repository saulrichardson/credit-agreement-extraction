[[A0198]]
The parties to this Agreement (the “ parties ”) hereby agree that the Claims may be arbitrated in one or more Arbitrations pursuant to these Arbitration Provisions (one for an injunction or injunctions and a separate one for all other Claims).

(as amended or superseded from time to time, the “ Arbitration Act ”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to, and to the maximum extent permitted by, Section 105 of the Arbitration Act, in the event of conflict or variation between the terms of these Arbitration Provisions and the provisions of the Arbitration Act, the terms of these Arbitration Provisions shall control and the parties hereby waive or otherwise agree to vary the effect of all requirements of the Arbitration Act that may conflict with or vary from these Arbitration Provisions.

[[A0210]]
4.1 Initiation of Arbitration . Pursuant to Section 110 of the Arbitration Act, the parties agree that a party may initiate Arbitration by giving written notice to the other party (“ Arbitration Notice ”) in the same manner that notice is permitted under Section 11.10 of the Agreement; provided, however , that the Arbitration Notice may not be given by email or fax.

[[A0211]]
Arbitration will be deemed initiated as of the date that the Arbitration Notice is deemed delivered to such other party under Section 11.10 of the Agreement (the “ Service Date ”). After the Service Date, information may be delivered, and notices may be given, by email or fax pursuant to Section 11.10 of the Agreement or any other method permitted thereunder.

[[A0214]]
[[TABLE]]

[[/TABLE]]

[[A0215]]
4.2 Selection and Payment of Arbitrator .

[[A0216]]
- Within ten (10) calendar
days after the Service Date, Investor shall select and submit to Company the names of three (3) arbitrators that are designated as “neutrals”
or qualified arbitrators by Utah ADR Services (http://www.utahadrservices.com) (such three (3) designated persons hereunder are referred
to herein as the “
Proposed Arbitrators
”). For the avoidance of doubt, each Proposed Arbitrator must be qualified as
a “neutral” with Utah ADR Services.

[[A0217]]
Within five (5) calendar days after Investor has submitted to Company the names of the
Proposed Arbitrators, Company must select, by written notice to Investor, one (1) of the Proposed Arbitrators to act as the arbitrator
for the parties under these Arbitration Provisions.

[[A0218]]
If Company fails to select one of the Proposed Arbitrators in writing within such
5-day period, then Investor may select the arbitrator from the Proposed Arbitrators by providing written notice of such selection to Company.

[[A0219]]
- If Investor fails
to submit to Company the Proposed Arbitrators within ten (10) calendar days after the Service Date pursuant to subparagraph (a) above,
then Company may at any time prior to Investor so designating the Proposed Arbitrators, identify the names of three (3) arbitrators that
are designated as “neutrals” or qualified arbitrators by Utah ADR Service by written notice to Investor.

[[A0220]]
Investor may then,
within five (5) calendar days after Company has submitted notice of its Proposed Arbitrators to Investor, select, by written notice to
Company, one (1) of the Proposed Arbitrators to act as the arbitrator for the parties under these Arbitration Provisions.

[[A0221]]
If Investor
fails to select in writing and within such 5-day period one (1) of the three (3) Proposed Arbitrators selected by Company, then Company
may select the arbitrator from its three (3) previously selected Proposed Arbitrators by providing written notice of such selection to
Investor.

[[A0222]]
- If a Proposed Arbitrator
chosen to serve as arbitrator declines or is otherwise unable to serve as arbitrator, then the party that selected such Proposed Arbitrator
may select one (1) of the other three (3) Proposed Arbitrators within three (3) calendar days of the date the chosen Proposed Arbitrator
declines or notifies the parties he or she is unable to serve as arbitrator.

[[A0223]]
If all three (3) Proposed Arbitrators decline or are otherwise
unable to serve as arbitrator, then the arbitrator selection process shall begin again in accordance with this Paragraph 4.2.

[[A0224]]
- The date that the
Proposed Arbitrator selected pursuant to this Paragraph 4.2 agrees in writing (including via email) delivered to both parties to serve
as the arbitrator hereunder is referred to herein as the “
Arbitration Commencement Date
”. If an arbitrator resigns
or is unable to act during the Arbitration, a replacement arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with this Paragraph 4.2 to continue
the Arbitration.

[[A0225]]
If Utah ADR Services ceases to exist or to provide a list of neutrals and there is no successor thereto, then the arbitrator
shall be selected under the then prevailing rules of the American Arbitration Association.

[[A0226]]
- Subject to Paragraph
4.10 below, the cost of the arbitrator must be paid equally by both parties.

[[A0227]]
Subject to Paragraph 4.10 below, if one party refuses or
fails to pay its portion of the arbitrator fee, then the other party can advance such unpaid amount (subject to the accrual of Default
Interest thereupon), with such amount being added to or subtracted from, as applicable, the Arbitration Award.

[[A0228]]
4.3 Applicability of Certain Utah Rules . The parties agree that the Arbitration shall be conducted generally in accordance with the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure and the Utah Rules of Evidence.

[[A0229]]
More specifically, the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply, without limitation, to the filing of any pleadings, motions or memoranda, the conducting of discovery, and the taking of any depositions.

[[A0230]]
The Utah Rules of Evidence shall apply to any hearings, whether telephonic or in person, held by the arbitrator.

[[A0231]]
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the parties’ intent that the incorporation of such rules will in no event supersede these Arbitration Provisions.

[[A0232]]
In the event of any conflict between the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure or the Utah Rules of Evidence and these Arbitration Provisions, these Arbitration Provisions shall control.

[[A0233]]
4.4 Answer and Default . An answer and any counterclaims to the Arbitration Notice shall be required to be delivered to the party initiating the Arbitration within twenty (20) calendar days after the Arbitration Commencement Date.

[[A0234]]
If an answer is not delivered by the required deadline, the arbitrator must provide written notice to the defaulting party stating that the arbitrator will enter a default award against such party if such party does not file an answer within five (5) calendar days of receipt of such notice.

[[A0235]]
If an answer is not filed within the five (5) day extension period, the arbitrator must render a default award, consistent with the relief requested in the Arbitration Notice, against a party that fails to submit an answer within such time period.

[[A0236]]
4.5 Related Litigation . The party that delivers the Arbitration Notice to the other party shall have the option to also commence concurrent legal proceedings with any state or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah (“ Litigation Proceedings ”), subject to the following: (a) the complaint in the Litigation Proceedings is to be substantially similar to the claims set forth in the Arbitration Notice, provided that an additional cause of action to compel arbitration will also be included therein, (b) so long as the other party files an answer to the complaint in the Litigation Proceedings and an answer to the Arbitration Notice, the Litigation Proceedings will be stayed pending an Arbitration Award (or Appeal Panel Award (defined below), as applicable) hereunder, (c) if the other party fails to file an answer in the Litigation Proceedings or an answer in the Arbitration proceedings, then the party initiating Arbitration shall be entitled to a default judgment consistent with the relief requested, to be entered in the Litigation Proceedings, and (d) any legal or procedural issue arising under the Arbitration Act that requires a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction may be determined in the Litigation Proceedings.

[[A0237]]
Any award of the arbitrator (or of the Appeal Panel (defined below)) may be entered in such Litigation Proceedings pursuant to the Arbitration Act.

[[A0238]]
[[TABLE]]

[[/TABLE]]

[[A0239]]
4.6 Discovery . Pursuant to Section 118(8) of the Arbitration Act, the parties agree that discovery shall be conducted as follows:

[[A0240]]
- Written discovery
will only be allowed if the likely benefits of the proposed written discovery outweigh the burden or expense thereof, and the written
discovery sought is likely to reveal information that will satisfy a specific element of a claim or defense already pleaded in the Arbitration.

[[A0241]]
The party seeking written discovery shall always have the burden of showing that all of the standards and limitations set forth in these
Arbitration Provisions are satisfied.

[[A0242]]
The scope of discovery in the Arbitration proceedings shall also be limited as follows:

[[A0243]]
- To
facts directly connected with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

[[A0244]]
- To
facts and information that cannot be obtained from another source or in another manner that is more convenient, less burdensome or less
expensive than in the manner requested.

[[A0245]]
- No party shall be
allowed (i) more than fifteen (15) interrogatories (including discrete subparts), (ii) more than fifteen (15) requests for admission (including
discrete subparts), (iii) more than ten (10) document requests (including discrete subparts), or (iv) more than three (3) depositions
(excluding expert depositions) for a maximum of seven (7) hours per deposition.

[[A0246]]
The costs associated with depositions will be borne by
the party taking the deposition.

[[A0247]]
The party defending the deposition will submit a notice to the party taking the deposition of the estimated
attorneys’ fees that such party expects to incur in connection with defending the deposition.

[[A0248]]
If the party defending the deposition
fails to submit an estimate of attorneys’ fees within five (5) calendar days of its receipt of a deposition notice, then such party
shall be deemed to have waived its right to the estimated attorneys’ fees.

[[A0249]]
The party taking the deposition must pay the party defending
the deposition the estimated attorneys’ fees prior to taking the deposition, unless such obligation is deemed to be waived as set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence.

[[A0250]]
If the party taking the deposition believes that the estimated attorneys’ fees are
unreasonable, such party may submit the issue to the arbitrator for a decision.

[[A0251]]
All depositions will be taken in Utah.

[[A0252]]
- All discovery requests
(including document production requests included in deposition notices) must be submitted in writing to the arbitrator and the other party.

[[A0253]]
The party submitting the written discovery requests must include with such discovery requests a detailed explanation of how the proposed
discovery requests satisfy the requirements of these Arbitration Provisions and the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.

[[A0254]]
The receiving party
will then be allowed, within five (5) calendar days of receiving the proposed discovery requests, to submit to the arbitrator an estimate
of the attorneys’ fees and costs associated with responding to such written discovery requests and a written challenge to each applicable
discovery request.

[[A0255]]
After receipt of an estimate of attorneys’ fees and costs and/or challenge(s) to one or more discovery requests,
consistent with subparagraph (c) above, the arbitrator will within three (3) calendar days make a finding as to the likely attorneys’
fees and costs associated with responding to the discovery requests and issue an order that (i) requires the requesting party to prepay
the attorneys’ fees and costs associated with responding to the discovery requests, and (ii) requires the responding party to respond
to the discovery requests as limited by the arbitrator within twenty-five (25) calendar days of the arbitrator’s finding with respect
to such discovery requests.

[[A0256]]
If a party entitled to submit an estimate of attorneys’ fees and costs and/or a challenge to discovery
requests fails to do so within such 5-day period, the arbitrator will make a finding that (A) there are no attorneys’ fees or costs
associated with responding to such discovery requests, and (B) the responding party must respond to such discovery requests (as may be
limited by the arbitrator) within twenty-five (25) calendar days of the arbitrator’s finding with respect to such discovery requests.

[[A0257]]
Any party submitting any written discovery requests, including without limitation interrogatories, requests for production subpoenas to
a party or a third party, or requests for admissions, must prepay the estimated attorneys’ fees and costs, before the responding
party has any obligation to produce or respond to the same, unless such obligation is deemed waived as set forth above.

[[A0258]]
- In order to allow
a written discovery request, the arbitrator must find that the discovery request satisfies the standards set forth in these Arbitration
Provisions and the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.

[[A0259]]
The arbitrator must strictly enforce these standards.

[[A0260]]
If a discovery request does not
satisfy any of the standards set forth in these Arbitration Provisions or the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, the arbitrator may modify

[[A0281]]
Following the entry of the Arbitration Award, either party (the “ Appellant ”) shall have a period of thirty (30) calendar days in which to notify the other party (the “ Appellee ”), in writing, that the Appellant elects to appeal (the “ Appeal ”) the Arbitration Award (such notice, an “ Appeal Notice ”) to a panel of arbitrators as provided in Paragraph 5.2 below.

[[A0282]]
The date the Appellant delivers an Appeal Notice to the Appellee is referred to herein as the “ Appeal Date ”. The Appeal Notice must be delivered to the Appellee in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 4.1 above with respect to delivery of an Arbitration Notice.

[[A0283]]
In addition, together with delivery of the Appeal Notice to the Appellee, the Appellant must also pay for (and provide proof of such payment to the Appellee together with delivery of the Appeal Notice) a bond in the amount of 110% of the sum the Appellant owes to the Appellee as a result of the Arbitration Award the Appellant is appealing.

[[A0284]]
In the event an Appellant delivers an Appeal Notice to the Appellee (together with proof of payment of the applicable bond) in compliance with the provisions of this Paragraph 5.1, the Appeal will occur as a matter of right and, except as specifically set forth herein, will not be further conditioned.

[[A0285]]
In the event a party does not deliver an Appeal Notice (along with proof of payment of the applicable bond) to the other party within the deadline prescribed in this Paragraph 5.1, such party shall lose its right to appeal the Arbitration Award.

[[A0286]]
If no party delivers an Appeal Notice (along with proof of payment of the applicable bond) to the other party within the deadline described in this Paragraph 5.1, the Arbitration Award shall be final.

whom may be the Original Arbitrator) by written notice to the Appellee.

[[A0293]]
The Appellee may then, within five (5) calendar days after the
Appellant has submitted notice of its selected arbitrators to the Appellee, select, by written notice to the Appellant, three (3) of such
selected arbitrators to serve on the Appeal Panel.

[[A0294]]
If the Appellee fails to select in writing within such 5-day period three (3) of the
arbitrators selected by the Appellant to serve as the members of the Appeal Panel, then the Appellant may select the three (3) members
of the Appeal Panel from the Appellant’s list of five (5) arbitrators by providing written notice of such selection to the Appellee.

[[A0295]]
- If a selected
Proposed Appeal Arbitrator declines or is otherwise unable to serve, then the party that selected such Proposed Appeal Arbitrator may
select one (1) of the other five (5) designated Proposed Appeal Arbitrators within three (3) calendar days of the date a chosen Proposed
Appeal Arbitrator declines or notifies the parties he or she is unable to serve as an arbitrator.

[[A0296]]
If at least three (3) of the five (5)
designated Proposed Appeal Arbitrators decline or are otherwise unable to serve, then the Proposed Appeal Arbitrator selection process
shall begin again in accordance with this Paragraph 5.2;
provided, however
, that any Proposed Appeal Arbitrators who have already
agreed to serve shall remain on the Appeal Panel.

all three (3) Proposed Appeal Arbitrators selected pursuant to this Paragraph 5.2 agree in writing (including via email) delivered to

”. No later than five (5) calendar days after the Appeal Commencement Date, the Appellee shall designate in writing (including
via email) to the Appellant and the Appeal Panel the name of one (1) of the three (3) members of the Appeal Panel to serve as the lead
arbitrator in the Appeal proceedings.

[[A0298]]

Provisions and the Arbitration Act, provided that, in conducting the Appeal, the Appeal Panel may only act or make determinations upon
the approval or vote of no less than the majority vote of its members, as announced or communicated by the lead arbitrator on the Appeal
Panel.

[[A0299]]
If an arbitrator on the Appeal Panel ceases or is unable to act during the Appeal proceedings,
a replacement arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with Paragraph 5.2 above to continue the Appeal as a member of the Appeal Panel.
