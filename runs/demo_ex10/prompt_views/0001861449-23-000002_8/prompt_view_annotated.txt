The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations shall be absolute, irrevocable, and unconditional and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged, or otherwise affected by: (a) any failure or delay to enforce the provisions of the Note Purchase Agreement or any of the other Note Documents or the other Note Documents; (b) the perfection, release or extent of any Collateral or any failure to realize on any Collateral; (c) any waiver, modification or consent to departure from, or amendment of the Note Purchase Agreement or any of the other Note Documents; (d) the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Note Purchase Agreement, any of the other Note Documents, or the Guaranteed Obligations; (e) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Issuer or the other Note Parties; or (f) any other circumstances (other than payment or conversion in full of the Obligations or the Guaranteed Obligations) which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor.

[[A0007]]
This Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection.

[[A0008]]
The Beneficiaries have no duty or responsibility whatsoever to the Guarantor and make no representation or warranty in respect of the management and maintenance of the Guaranteed Obligations or any collateral therefor. 3. Waiver by Guarantor.

[[A0010]]
The Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of this Guarantee, diligence, acceleration, presentment, notice of default or demand of payment to or upon the Issuer or the Guarantor, filing of claims with a court in the event of merger or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right or requirement to proceed first against the Issuer, any protest or notice with respect to the Note Purchase Agreement or the obligations created or evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, any exchange, sale or surrender of, or realization on, any other guarantee or any collateral, and any and all other notices and surety defenses (other than payment in full) whatsoever.

3 US-DOCS\137586126.7 proceeding, and the failure of the Beneficiaries to so file shall not affect the Guarantor’s obligations hereunder. 4. Reinstatement in Certain Instances.

[[A0013]]
