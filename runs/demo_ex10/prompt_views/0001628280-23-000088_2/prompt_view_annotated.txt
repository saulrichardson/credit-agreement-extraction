Document December 22, 2022 Stephen Sjuggerud VIA EMAIL: [*] RE: Compensation Terms (Interim Chief Executive Officer) Dear Steve: Thank you for your ongoing contributions to the success of MarketWise, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, affiliates and/or successors thereto as may employ you from time to time, the “Company” ). We are pleased to confirm the terms of your compensation as Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company (“Interim CEO” ) in this letter (“Letter” ), effective as of November 18, 2022 (“Effective Date” ) and ending on the last day of your employment as Interim CEO.

[[A0002]]
Your annualized base salary will be $750,000 (“Base Salary” ) as of the Effective Date, subject to any applicable deductions and withholdings, and payable in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll practices that apply to you.

[[A0003]]
For the avoidance of doubt, the Base Salary payments hereunder during your employment as Interim CEO shall be in lieu of the annual guaranteed payments that you are entitled to receive for such period pursuant to Section 2(a)(i) of that certain Employment Agreement dated May 1, 2015 by and between you and the Company (the “Employment Agreement ”) as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date of this Letter.

[[A0004]]
In the event of the termination of your employment as Interim CEO by the Company without Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement) prior to the 12-month anniversary of the Effective Date of this Letter, you will be eligible to receive a lump-sum Base Salary adjustment based on the duration of your employment as Interim CEO.

[[A0005]]
The Base Salary adjustment assures you a minimum Base Salary (the “Adjusted Base Salary” ) in accordance with the table below:

[[A0006]]
[[TABLE]]
| | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Duration of Employment | Adjusted Base Salary | | | | |
| < 6 months | $375,000 | | | | |
| ≥ 6 months and < 12 months | $750,000 | | | | |
[[/TABLE]]

[[A0007]]
In the event of a termination of your employment as Interim CEO without Cause, we will calculate your Base Salary adjustment by subtracting from your Adjusted Base Salary amount the cumulative Base Salary payments made to you as Interim CEO prior to such termination.

[[A0008]]
Your Base Salary adjustment will be paid to you within sixty (60) days of the termination of your employment as Interim CEO.

[[A0009]]
You will also be eligible to receive two discretionary bonuses (each, a “ Discretionary Bonus ” and collectively, the “ Discretionary Bonuses ”), based on the duration of your employment as Interim CEO as follows: Page 2 of 3 Pages

[[A0013]]
Your first Discretionary Bonus, if any, will be paid to you within thirty (30) days of your 6-month anniversary of your employment as Interim CEO (or the termination of your employment as Interim CEO, if sooner).

[[A0016]]
For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of the Discretionary Bonuses, if any, may be awarded at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee and are in lieu of the discretionary bonuses that you are eligible to receive for such period under your Employment Agreement.

[[A0017]]
You continue to be responsible for personal tax obligations associated with the compensation outlined above.

[[A0018]]
The Company will not withhold taxes and will make gross payments to you.

[[A0019]]
This Letter constitutes our entire understanding and agreement regarding your compensation as Interim CEO, and supersedes all prior negotiations, communications, understandings, and agreements relating thereto.

[[A0021]]
When your employment as Interim CEO ends, we will adjust your compensation terms to replace the Base Salary payable pursuant to this Letter with the annual guaranteed payments under the Employment Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date of this Letter.

[[A0022]]
