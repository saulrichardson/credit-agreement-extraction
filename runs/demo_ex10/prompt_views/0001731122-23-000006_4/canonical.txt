3

(c)
Mechanics
of Conversion
.

(i.) Conversion Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . The number of shares issuable upon a conversion (the “ Conversion Shares ”) pursuant to Section 5(b) hereunder shall be determined by the quotient obtained by dividing the outstanding principal amount of this Note and accrued but unpaid interest thereon to be converted by (y) the Conversion Price.

(ii.) Delivery of Conversion Shares Upon Conversion . Not later than seven (7) Business Days (the “ Share Delivery Date ”) after receiving a conversion notice substantially in a form attached herein as Exhibit 1 , the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the Conversion Shares or a share report of the Holder reflecting the issuance of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of this Note, in whole or in part.

(iii.) Fractional Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of this Note. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive upon such conversion, the Company shall at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share.

(d)
Certain
Adjustments
.

(i.)

Stock Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Note is outstanding: (i) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (ii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iii) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Company, then the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) outstanding immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 5(d) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.

(ii.)

Most Favored Nation Status . If the Company or any subsidiary thereof, as applicable, at any time while this Note is outstanding or the Holder holds any Conversion Shares, shall sell or grant any option to purchase, or sell or grant any right to reprice, or otherwise dispose of or issue (or announce any offer, sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition) any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, at an effective price per share less than the Conversion Price then in effect (such lower price, the “ Base Share Price ” and such issuances collectively, a “ Dilutive Issuance ”) (it being understood and agreed that if the holder of the Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options or rights per share which are issued in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive Common Stock at an effective price per share that is less than the Conversion Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Conversion Price on such date of the Dilutive Issuance at such effective price),

4

then simultaneously with the consummation of each Dilutive Issuance the Conversion Price shall be reduced and only reduced to equal the Base Share Price. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustments shall be made, paid or issued under this Section in respect of an Exempt Issuance. The Company shall notify the Holder, in writing, no later than the Trading Day following the issuance or deemed issuance of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents subject to this Section, indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice, the “ Dilutive Issuance Notice ”). For purposes of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section, upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, the Holder is entitled to receive a number of Conversion Shares based upon the Base Share Price regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers to the Base Share Price in the Notice of Conversion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not issue any shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section if to do so would require the Company to obtain approval of its shareholders under the applicable rules of the NYSE American and as such the Company shall only issue such number of shares of common stock as would not require the Company to obtain shareholder approval under the applicable rules of the NYSE American.

(iii.) Notice of Adjustment to Conversion Price . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to this Section 5(d), the Company shall promptly deliver to each Holder a notice setting forth the new Conversion Price with three (3) Business Days after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Failure to provide such notice shall not constitute an Event of Default.

6. COVENANTS . Until so long as no Principal or accrued but unpaid Interest remains outstanding:

(a)
Preservation of Existence.
The
Company shall maintain and preserve its existence, rights and privileges, and become or remain duly qualified and in good standing in
