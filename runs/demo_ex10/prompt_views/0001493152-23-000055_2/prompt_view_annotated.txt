[[A0019]]
3. Status of the Common Stock .

[[A0020]]
The shares of Common Stock issued under the terms of Section 1and Section 2 have been duly authorized by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee of the Company, are fully paid as of the date of this Agreement, duly issued and non-assessable and “restricted” securities as defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act ”).

[[A0021]]
4. Adjustment to Shares of Common Stock .

[[A0022]]
4.1.

[[A0023]]
The Company has been engaged and continues to engage in the negotiations of certain transactions that, if there is an agreement for any such transaction, would be subject to disclosure under the rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “ Exchange Act ”), including by the filing of a Form 8-K by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ Commission ”), although there is no assurance that any such transaction would be consummated or agreement entered into on terms that are acceptable to the Company or at all (any such transaction or entering in any such agreement, being a “ Specified Transaction ”).

[[A0024]]
4.2.

[[A0025]]
In the event that there is a Specified Transaction, then the Holder will promptly transfer and assign such number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the terms of Section 1and Section 2 of this Agreement after any Specified Transaction so that after such transfer and assignment, the Holder will hold a number of shares of Common Stock equal to $1,200,000 divided by the closing price per share of Common Stock on the date that is one full trading day after the date that the Company makes a filing with the Commission with respect to any Specified Transaction, and such shares of Common Stock that are so transferred and assigned shall be cancelled by the Company

[[A0026]]
4.3. By way of example if there is a filing with the Commission at 8am EST on January 17, 2023 regarding a Transaction that Adjusts the Issuance Price and the closing price per share of Common Stock on January 17, 2023 is $0.844, then the Holder will transfer 355,288 shares of Common Stock to the Company for cancellation and the Holder will hold 1,421,148 shares of Common Stock and not the 1,776,436 shares of Common Stock that are issued under Section 1and Section 2 of this Agreement, which will cause an adjustment of the Issuance Price from $0.675.

[[A0027]]
to such closing price of $0.844.

[[A0028]]
4.4. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the adjustments in this Section 4 shall only be applicable to a Specified Transaction that (i) occurs on or prior to January 31, 2023; and (ii) results in a closing price per share of Common Stock that is greater than the Issuance Price (or the Issuance Price as then adjusted).
