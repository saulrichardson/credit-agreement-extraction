[[TABLE]]
| | 4. | DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS. The Participant will be credited with dividend equivalents on the RSUs when and if
dividends are declared by the Company’s Board on the Company’s Stock, in an amount of cash per RSU equal to the per share dividend amount payable to common stockholders of the Company, provided that any dividend equivalents shall only vest
and be payable if and to the extent that the underlying RSUs vest. Dividend equivalents accrued on RSUs before the Vesting Date of such corresponding RSUs shall be paid on the next occurring payroll date after the applicable Vesting Date. Dividend
equivalents accrued on vested RSUs after the applicable Vesting Date but before the Settlement Date shall be paid on the next occurring payroll date after the corresponding dividend payment date for the Company’s Stock. Dividend equivalents
attributable to the RSUs shall be subject to the same restrictions on transferability as the shares of Company Stock with respect to which they are to be paid, and if any such RSUs are forfeited, the right to receive payments for such dividend
equivalents related to such forfeited RSUs shall also be forfeited. Payments of dividend equivalents accrued before delivery of shares in settlement of RSUs will be paid through the Company’s payroll process and treated as compensation income
for tax purposes and will be subject to income and payroll tax withholding by the Company. |

Affiliate; or (ii) withholding shares of Stock from the shares of Stock issued or otherwise issuable to the Participant in connection with the vesting of the Award a number of shares of Stock with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the date
