Confidentiality

Definition

Confidential Information does not include information that (i) is known to Consultant at the time of disclosure to Consultant by LanzaTech as evidenced by written records of Consultant, (ii) has become publicly known and made generally available otherwise than through Consultant’s unauthorized disclosure, or (iii) has been rightfully received by Consultant from a third party otherwise than through such third party’s unauthorized disclosure.
b.
Nonuse and Nondisclosure

Consultant will not (i) use the Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever other than the performance of the Services or (ii) disclose the Confidential Information to any third party other than with prior written approval from the Company. Consultant agrees that all Confidential Information will remain the sole property of LanzaTech. Consultant also agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized disclosure of such Confidential Information. Except as expressly provided in paragraph 6 of the Transition Agreement dated December 28, 2022, Consultant will not use Company’s name, the name of any LanzaTech entity, or the name of any of their employees in any advertising, news releases, publicity, or any other public disclosure without prior written approval of the Company. Further, notwithstanding Consultant’s confidentiality and nondisclosure obligations, Consultant is hereby advised as follows pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act:
An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law;
​
​
Exhibit B - 1
​
or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (x) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (y) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
c.
Former Client Confidential Information
. Consultant agrees that Consultant will not improperly use or disclose any proprietary information or trade secrets of any former or current employer of Consultant or of any person or entity with which Consultant has an agreement or duty to keep in confidence such information, if any. Consultant also agrees that Consultant will not bring onto LanzaTech’s premises any unpublished document or proprietary information belonging to any such employer, person, or entity unless consented to in writing by such employer, person, or entity and the Company.
d.
Third Party Confidential Information
. Consultant recognizes that LanzaTech has received, and in the future will receive, from third parties their confidential or proprietary information subject to a duty on LanzaTech’s part to maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes. Consultant agrees that Consultant owes the Company and such third parties a duty to hold all such confidential or proprietary information in the strictest confidence and not to disclose it to any person, firm, or corporation or to use it, except as necessary in carrying out the Services consistent with LanzaTech’s agreement with such third party.
e.
Return of Materials
. Upon the termination of this Consulting Agreement, or upon Company’s earlier request, Consultant will deliver to the Company all of LanzaTech’s property, including but not limited to all electronically stored information and passwords to access such property, or Confidential Information that Consultant may have in Consultant’s possession or control.
3.
Ownership
.
a.
Assignment
. Consultant agrees that all copyrightable material, notes, records, inventions, improvements, developments, discoveries, and trade secrets conceived, discovered, developed, or reduced to practice by Consultant, solely or in collaboration with others, during the term of this Consulting Agreement that relate in any manner to the business of LanzaTech, or that Consultant may otherwise become associated with in performing the Services (collectively, “
Inventions
”), are the sole property of the Company. Consultant also agrees to assign (or cause to be assigned) and hereby assigns fully to the Company or its designee all Inventions and any copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property rights relating to all Inventions. Consultant agrees that the Inventions are hereby deemed a “work made for hire” as defined in U.S.C. § 101 for the Company. If, for any reason, any of the Inventions do not constitute a “work made for hire,” the Consultant hereby irrevocably assigns to the Company, in each case without additional consideration, all right, title, and interest throughout the world in and to the Inventions, including all intellectual property rights therein. Any assignment of copyrights under this Consulting Agreement includes all rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure, and withdrawal and any other rights that may be known as “moral rights,” and Consultant hereby irrevocably waives, to the extent permitted by law, any and all claims Consultant may have at any time in any jurisdiction to any such rights with respect to the Inventions.
b.
Further Assurances
. Consultant agrees to assist Company, or its designee, at the Company’s expense, in every proper way, to secure the Company’s or its designee’s rights in Inventions
​
​
​
and any copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property rights relating to all Inventions in any and all countries, including the disclosure to the Company of all pertinent information and data with respect to all Inventions; the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments, and all other instruments that the Company may deem necessary in order for it or its designee to apply for and obtain such rights; and in order to assign and convey to the Company; its designee; or its successors, assigns, or nominees the sole and exclusive right, title, and interest in and to all Inventions, and any copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property rights relating to all Inventions. Consultant also agrees that Consultant’s obligation to execute or cause to be executed any such instrument or papers shall continue after the termination of this Consulting Agreement.
c.
Prior Inventions.
Inventions, if any, patented or unpatented, which Consultant made prior to the beginning of the term of this Consulting Agreement are excluded from the scope of this Consulting Agreement, except to the extent they are subject to the Employee Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement dated May 1, 2020 (the “
PIIA Agreement
”). To exclude any possible uncertainty, Consultant has set out on
Schedule B
a complete list of all Inventions that Consultant has, alone or jointly with others, conceived, developed, or reduced to practice or caused to be conceived, developed, or reduced to practice prior to the beginning of the term of this Consulting Agreement, that Consultant considers to be Consultant’s property or the property of third parties and that Consultant wishes to have excluded from the scope of this Consulting Agreement (collectively, “
Prior Inventions
”). If disclosure of any such Prior Invention would cause Consultant to violate any prior confidentiality agreement, Consultant should not list such Prior Inventions on
Schedule B
, but only disclose a cursory name for each such invention, a listing of the party(ies) to whom it belongs and the fact that full disclosure as to such inventions has not been made for that reason. A space is provided on
Schedule B
for such purpose. Contractor warrants and represents that
Schedule B
is a complete and accurate list of Prior Inventions and if no such disclosure is attached, Consultant warrants and represents that there are no Prior Inventions.

Miscellaneous
.
a.
Governing Law

Consultant acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law available to the Company for breach by Consultant of any of Consultant’s obligations under
Section 2
of this Consulting Agreement would be inadequate and that damages flowing from such a breach would not readily be susceptible to being measured in monetary terms.
