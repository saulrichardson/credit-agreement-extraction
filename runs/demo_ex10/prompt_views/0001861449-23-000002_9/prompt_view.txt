The choice of receiver and its remuneration shall be within the sole discretion of the Collateral Agent. Any receiver appointed by the Collateral Agent shall act as agent for the Collateral Agent and the Purchasers for the purposes of taking possession of the Collateral, but otherwise and for all other purposes (except as provided below), as agent for the Grantor. The receiver may sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of Collateral as agent for the Grantor or as agent for the Collateral Agent as the Collateral Agent may determine in its sole discretion. The Grantor agrees to ratify and confirm all actions of the receiver acting as agent for the Grantor, and to release and indemnify the receiver in respect of all such actions. The Collateral Agent , in

-11- CAN_DMS: \149670305\3 appointing or refraining from appointing any receiver, shall not incur any liability to the receiver, the Grantor or any other Person and shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence of such Person. The Collateral Agent shall give the Grantor no less than ten (10) days’ prior written notice of the Collateral Agent’s intention to make any sale of Collateral. Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker’s board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Collateral or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) may (in its sole and absolute discretion) determine. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given. The Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Collateral Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of the Grantor (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to such Secured Party from the Grantor as a credit against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to the Grantor therefor. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3.01 shall be deemed to in accordance with any requirements under the PPSA or the STA or their equivalent in other jurisdictions. ARTICLE IV Miscellaneous SECTION 4.01. Notices. All communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in the Note Purchase Agreement. SECTION 4.02. Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Note Document shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties hereunder and under the other Note Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that the Collateral Agent or the other Secured Parties would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Note Party therefrom shall

-12- CAN_DMS: \149670305\3 in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 4.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the purchase of a Note shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default hereunder, regardless of whether the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on any Note Party in any case shall entitle any Note Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Collateral Agent and the Grantor with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement; provided that the Collateral Agent may, without the consent of any other Secured Party, consent to a departure by the Grantor from any covenant set forth herein to the extent such departure is consistent with the authority of the Collateral Agent or Collateral Agent set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement. SECTION 4.03. Collateral Agent’s Fees and Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The Grantor agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent and the Purchasers for any Collateral Agent Expenses and Purchaser Expenses incurred hereunder as provided in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 of the Note Purchase Agreement and to indemnify the Collateral Agent and the Purchasers in accordance with Section 13.2(a) of the Note Purchase Agreement; provided that each reference therein to the “Issuer” shall be deemed to be a reference to “the Grantor”. (b) The provisions of this Section 4.03 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this Agreement or any other Note Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the repayment of any of the Secured Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Note Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of any Secured Party. All amounts due under this Section 4.03 shall be payable not later than twenty (20) Business Days after written demand therefor; provided, however, any Indemnitee shall promptly refund an indemnification payment received hereunder to the extent that there is a final judicial determination that such Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification with respect to such payment pursuant to this Section 4.03. Any such amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional Secured Obligations. SECTION 4.04. Successors and Assigns. Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the permitted successors and assigns of such party, and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the Grantor or the Collateral Agent that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns. SECTION 4.05. Survival of Agreement. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Grantor in this Agreement or any other Note Document and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Note Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Secured Parties and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Note Documents and the purchase of any Notes, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Secured Party and notwithstanding that the Collateral Agent, the Purchasers or any other Secured Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Note Purchase Agreement or any other Note Document, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Termination Date has occurred, in each case, in accordance with and subject to the limitations set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement.

-13- CAN_DMS: \149670305\3 SECTION 4.06. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Several Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of the Grantor and shall have been delivered to the Collateral Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Collateral Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon the Grantor and the Collateral Agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Grantor, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Grantor shall not have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any such assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly provided in this Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement. SECTION 4.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 4.08. Right of Set-off. If an Event of Default under the Note Purchase Agreement shall have occurred and be continuing, each Purchaser and its respective Affiliates are hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency, but not withholding or payroll accounts, employee benefits accounts, de minimis accounts or other accounts used exclusively for taxes or fiduciary or trust purposes) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Purchaser or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Grantor against any of and all the obligations of the Grantor then due and owing under this Agreement held by such Purchaser, irrespective of whether or not such Purchaser shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although (i) such obligations may be contingent or unmatured and (ii) such obligations are owed to a branch or office of such Purchaser different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such Debt. The applicable Purchaser shall notify the Grantor and the Collateral Agent of such setoff and application; provided that any failure to give or any delay in giving such notice shall not affect the validity of any such setoff and application under this Section 4.08. The rights of each Purchaser and its Affiliates under this Section 4.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Purchaser and its Affiliates may have. SECTION 4.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Appointment of Service of Process Agent. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein. (b) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the province of Ontario, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the courts of Ontario. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Collateral Agent or any Purchaser may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against the Grantor or its respective properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

-14- CAN_DMS: \149670305\3 (c) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 4.09. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. (d) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES IN SECTION 4.01. NOTHING IN ANY THIS AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW. (e) THE GRANTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY DESIGNATES, APPOINTS AND EMPOWERS THE GRANTOR AS ITS AUTHORIZED DESIGNEE, APPOINTEE AND AGENT TO RECEIVE, ACCEPT AND ACKNOWLEDGE FOR AND ON ITS BEHALF, AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL LEGAL PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICES AND DOCUMENTS THAT MAY BE SERVED IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING AND THE GRANTOR HEREBY ACCEPTS SUCH DESIGNATION AND APPOINTMENT. SECTION 4.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER NOTE DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 4.10. SECTION 4.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement. SECTION 4.12. Security Interest Absolute. To the extent permitted by Law, all rights of the Collateral Agent hereunder, the Security Interest, the grant of a security interest in the Pledged Collateral and all obligations of the Grantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Note Purchase Agreement, any other Note Document, any agreement with respect to any of the Secured Obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating to any of the foregoing, (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Secured Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Note Purchase Agreement, any other Note Document or any other agreement or instrument, (c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any Lien on other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent under or departure from any guarantee securing or guaranteeing all or any of the Secured Obligations or (d) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Grantor in respect of the Secured Obligations or this Agreement other than payment of the Secured Obligations in full.

-15- CAN_DMS: \149670305\3 SECTION 4.13. Termination or Release. (a) This Agreement, the Security Interest and all other security interests granted hereby shall terminate automatically upon the occurrence of the Termination Date. (b) In connection with any termination or release pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section, the Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver to any Note Party, at such Note Party’s expense, all documents that such Note Party shall reasonably request to evidence such termination or release so long as the applicable Note Party shall have provided the Collateral Agent such certifications or documents required by the Note Purchase Agreement in order to demonstrate compliance with this Section 4.13. Any execution and delivery of documents by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section shall be without recourse to or warranty by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party. SECTION 4.14. Collateral Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. The Grantor hereby makes, constitutes and appoints the Collateral Agent (and all officers, employees or agents designated by the Collateral Agent) the attorney-in-fact of the Grantor for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the Collateral Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof at any time after and during the continuance of an Event of Default, which appointment is irrevocable (until termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 4.13) and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall have the right, but only upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, with full power of substitution either in the Collateral Agent’s name or in the name of the Grantor: (a) to receive, indorse, assign and/or deliver any and all notes, acceptances, cheques, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Collateral or any part thereof; (b) to demand, collect, receive payment of, give receipt for and give discharges and releases of all or any of the Collateral; (c) to sign the name of the Grantor on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the Collateral; (d) to send verifications of accounts receivable to any Account Debtor; (e) to commence and prosecute any and all suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect or otherwise realize on all or any of the Collateral or to enforce any rights in respect of any Collateral; (f) to settle, compromise, compound, adjust or defend any actions, suits or proceedings relating to all or any of the Collateral; (g) to the extent the Notes have been accelerated pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, to notify, or to require the Grantor to notify, Account Debtors to make payment directly to the Collateral Agent; (h) to use, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with all or any of the Collateral, and to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner of the Collateral for all purposes, and (i) to make, settle and adjust claims in respect of Collateral under policies of insurance, indorsing the name of the Grantor on any cheque, draft, instrument or other item of payment for the proceeds of such policies of insurance and for making all determinations and decisions with respect thereto; provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating the Collateral Agent to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by the Collateral Agent, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or any property covered thereby. The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts actually received as a result of the exercise of the powers granted to them herein, and neither they nor their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to the Grantor for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or that of any of their controlled Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents or attorneys-in-fact. The provisions of Exhibit C of the Note Purchase Agreement, including the rights, privileges, protections, benefits, indemnities and immunities of the Collateral Agent are incorporated herein, mutatis mutandis, as if a part hereof, and shall also apply to the Collateral Agent acting under or in connection with this Agreement. If the Collateral Agent has a right to take or omit to take any action hereunder, it shall exercise such right if so instructed by the Required Purchasers. With respect to any discretion, consent, approval or similar such action to be made, taken,

-16- CAN_DMS: \149670305\3 omitted to be taken or determined by the Collateral Agent under this Agreement (each an “Agent Determination”), such Agent Determination shall be made by the Collateral Agent at the direction of the Required Purchasers. SECTION 4.15. Further Assurances. The Grantor shall from time to time, whether before or after the pledge and security interest has become enforceable, do all acts and things and execute and deliver all transfers, assignments and agreements as the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) may reasonably require for (a) protecting the Collateral, (b) perfecting the Collateral and the security interest, (c) obtaining control of the Collateral, (d) exercising all powers, authorities and discretions conferred upon the Collateral Agent, and (e) otherwise enabling the Collateral Agent to obtain the full benefits of this security agreement and the rights and powers herein granted. The Grantor shall, from time to time after the pledge and security interest has become enforceable, do all acts and things and execute and deliver all transfers, assignments and agreements as the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) may require for facilitating the sale or other disposition of the Collateral in connection with its realization. SECTION 4.16. Judgment Currency. (a) If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due to a Secured Party in any currency (the “Original Currency”) into another currency (the “Other Currency”), the parties agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures, such Secured Party could purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency on the Business Day preceding the day on which final judgment is given or, if permitted by applicable law, on the day on which the judgment is paid or satisfied. (b) The obligations of the Grantor in respect of any sum due in the Original Currency from it to any Secured Party under this Agreement shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any Other Currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Secured Party of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Other Currency, such Secured Party may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase the Original Currency with such Other Currency. If the amount of the Original Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Secured Party in the Original Currency, the Grantor agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding the judgment, to indemnify such Secured Party against any loss, and, if the amount of the Original Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to such Secured Party in the Original Currency, such Secured Party shall remit such excess the Grantor.
