​ December 28, 2022 Sean Simpson [***] Via Email Dear Sean: In recognition of your founding role with LanzaTech NZ, Inc. (the “ Company ”) and your significant contributions over the last 17 years towards the success of the Company, including bringing it and your team to the current stage of public company readiness, this letter agreement is to record the outcome of our discussions around your transition into your next role with the Company.

[[A0004]]
We deeply appreciate the openness of our discussions on this important topic as well as your wish to fully support the Company in the next phase of its development, and we trust that the arrangements set out in this letter agreement accurately capture our mutual wishes for the future role and your transition into it.

[[A0005]]
In essence, you will move from being both a director of the Company (including its relevant subsidiaries and affiliates) and its Chief Science Officer, to being a consultant.

[[A0006]]
In your role as a consultant, you will provide advice and support to the Company’s senior leadership and also provide important support to the team for those particular strategic projects that require further transition.

[[A0007]]
It is our mutual intent that this transition be executed effectively and with delicacy, both in your and in the Company’s best interests, and whilst the way we will do that will develop and change over time in response to particular requirements, the remainder of this letter sets out some of the more formal aspects as to how we will achieve that.

[[A0008]]
Whilst aspects of the transition will take place over a significant period of time, the effective date for the change in your status, and hence your last day as a director and Chief Science Officer of the Company, will be January 1, 2023 (the “ Transition Date ”). We wish for you to enter into the consulting agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B (the “ Consulting Agreement ”) so that your new role as advisor to the Company begins seamlessly on the Transition Date.

[[A0009]]
In connection with the transition, the Company is offering to make the payments described in Paragraph 2 below (the “ Payments ”); provided that you sign and return this transition agreement, including the release of claims attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “ Release ” and together with this letter agreement, the “ Agreement ”), to Carl Wolf via DocuSign by January 10, 2023 (the “ Deadline ”), which is twenty-one (21) days after the date this Agreement was first provided to you.

[[A0010]]
The Payments will be made in accordance with Paragraph 2 (Payments) so long as you do not revoke your acceptance of the terms of this Agreement (as described below) and otherwise comply with the terms of this Agreement.

[[A0011]]
By signing and returning this Agreement and not revoking your acceptance, you will be entering into a binding agreement with the Company and will be agreeing to the terms and conditions set out in the Release and the numbered paragraphs below. ​ ​ 1 ​
