[[A0006]]

[[A0011]]
The Beneficiaries shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Guaranteed Obligations in the event that Issuer becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of the Beneficiaries to so file shall not affect the Guarantor’s obligations hereunder. 4.
