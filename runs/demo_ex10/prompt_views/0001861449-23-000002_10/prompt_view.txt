SECTION 3.03. Covenants. (a) Each Grantor shall, at its own expense, take any and all commercially reasonable actions necessary to (i) defend title to the applicable Collateral (other than Intellectual Property, which is governed by Section 3.04) against all Persons, except with respect to Collateral that such Grantor determines in its reasonable business judgment is no longer necessary or

-12- CAN_DMS: \149647507\7 beneficial to the conduct of such Grantor’s business (provided that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent such Grantor from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of its assets or properties to the extent not prohibited by the Note Purchase Agreement) and (ii) upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers), defend the Security Interest of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral and the priority thereof against any Lien, in each case subject to (x) Liens permitted pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, (y) transfers made in compliance with the Note Purchase Agreement and (z) the rights of such Grantor under Section 11.09 of the Note Purchase Agreement to obtain a release of the Liens created hereunder. (b) Each Grantor agrees, at its own expense, to execute, acknowledge, deliver and cause to be duly filed all such further instruments and documents and take all such actions as the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) may from time to time reasonably request to obtain, preserve, protect and perfect the Security Interest and the rights and remedies created hereby, including the payment of any reasonable and documented or invoiced out-of-pocket fees and Taxes required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the granting of the Security Interest and the filing of any financing statements or other documents in connection herewith or therewith; provided, however, each Grantor shall have no obligation to file any document or undertake any actions outside Canada or pursuant to any laws other than the laws of the United States or Canada. (c) At its option, the Collateral Agent may discharge past due taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances at any time levied or placed on the Collateral and not permitted pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, and may pay for the maintenance and preservation of the Collateral to the extent either Grantor fails to do so as required by the Note Purchase Agreement, this Agreement or any other Note Document and within a reasonable period of time after the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) has requested that it do so, and the Grantors agree to reimburse the Collateral Agent, within 10 days after demand, for any reasonable payment made or expense incurred by the Collateral Agent pursuant to the foregoing authorization in accordance with Section 5.03(a); provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be interpreted as excusing the Grantors from the performance of, or imposing any obligation on the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party to cure or perform, any covenants or other promises of the Grantors with respect to taxes, assessments, charges, fees, Liens, security interests or other encumbrances and maintenance as set forth herein or in the other Note Documents. (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is understood that the Grantors shall not be required by this Agreement to better assure, preserve, protect or perfect the Security Interest created hereunder by any means other than (i) filings (including financing statements or financing change statements) pursuant to the UCC, the PPR (or similar central filing office) of the relevant jurisdiction, (ii) filings with the United States Patent and Trademark the United States Copyright Office or the Canadian Intellectual Property Office or in any similar office or agency, in respect of registered or applied-for Patents, Trademarks or Copyrights, (iii) in the case of Collateral that constitutes Pledged Securities, Instruments, certificated securities (in each case not credited to a Securities Account), Tangible Chattel Paper or Negotiable Documents (other than those Instruments or Negotiable Documents held in the ordinary course of business), delivery thereof to the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms hereof (together with, where applicable, undated stock or note powers or other undated proper instruments of assignment) and (iv) other actions to the extent required by Section 3.04(b) (solely with respect to the second sentence thereof) or Section 3.04 hereunder. The Grantors shall not be required to (i) complete any filings or other action with respect to the better assurance, preservation, protection or perfection of the security interests created hereby in any jurisdiction outside of the United States or Canada or enter into any security document governed by the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States or Canada, or to reimburse the Collateral Agent for any costs incurred in connection with the same, (ii) deliver control agreements with respect to, or confer perfection by “control” (within the meaning of the STA) over, any Deposit Accounts, Securities

-13- CAN_DMS: \149647507\7 Accounts or (iii) perfect the security interest in motor vehicles, airplanes and other assets subject to certificates of title other than by filings (including financing statements or financing change statement) pursuant to the UCC or the PPR (or similar central filing office) of the relevant jurisdiction. (e) Schedule II hereto includes a true and complete list of all of the Grantors’ Patents and Trademarks applied for or issued or registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the Canadian Intellectual Property Office or in any similar office or agency, including the name of the registered owner or applicant and the registration, application, or publication number, as applicable, of each such Patent or Trademark and all of the Grantors’ Copyrights applied for or registered with the United States Copyright Office or the Canadian Intellectual Property Office or in any similar office or agency, including the name of the registered owner and the registration number of each such Copyright. SECTION 3.04. Covenants Regarding Patent, Trademark and Copyright Collateral. (a) Each Grantor agrees to take commercially reasonable steps to (i) maintain the validity and enforceability of any Canadian issued or registered Intellectual Property (or applications therefor) that is material to the conduct of such Grantor’s business and to maintain such registrations and applications of such Intellectual Property in full force and effect and (ii) pursue the registration and, to the extent such Grantor determine in its reasonable business judgment that maintenance of such Intellectual Property is desirable in the conduct of its business, maintenance of each patent, trademark or copyright registration or application included in the Intellectual Property of such Grantor. Each Grantor shall take commercially reasonable steps to defend title to and ownership of any Intellectual Property that is owned by such Grantor and is material to the conduct of such Grantor’s business. (b) Each Grantor shall notify the Collateral Agent as promptly as reasonably practicable if it knows, after due inquiry, that (i) any application or registration relating to any material Intellectual Property is likely to become forfeited, abandoned or dedicated to the public, or of any materially adverse determination or development related to such application or registration (including the institution of, or any such determination or development in, any proceeding in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or the Canadian Intellectual Property Office or in any similar office or agency or any court or tribunal in any country, but excluding any ordinary course office actions) regarding such Grantor’s ownership of, right to use, interest in, or the validity of, any material Intellectual Property owned by such Grantor or such Grantor’s right to register the same or to own and maintain the same or (ii) any action or proceeding, to the extent such action is not dismissed within thirty (30) days, that seeks to limit or cancel, or challenge the validity of, any material Intellectual Property owned by such Grantor or such Grantor’s ownership interest therein is pending or, to the knowledge of such Grantor, threatened. (c) Each Grantor agrees that, should it (i) obtain an ownership or other interest in any Intellectual Property after the date hereof, or (ii) file any application for the registration or issuance of any Intellectual Property with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or the Canadian Intellectual Property Office or in any similar office or agency within Canada (the items in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the “After-Acquired Intellectual Property”), then the provisions of this Agreement shall automatically apply thereto and any such After-Acquired Intellectual Property shall automatically become Intellectual Property subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, a security interest shall not be granted in any Intellectual Property that constitutes an Excluded Asset.

-14- CAN_DMS: \149647507\7 ARTICLE IV Remedies SECTION 4.01. Remedies upon Default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Grantor agrees to deliver, on demand, each item of Collateral to the Collateral Agent or any Person designated by the Collateral Agent, and it is agreed that the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) shall have the right to take any of or all the following actions at the same or different times: (a) with respect to any Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property, on demand, to cause the Security Interest to become an assignment, transfer and conveyance of any of or all such Collateral by each Grantor to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, or to license, whether on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis, any such Collateral throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the Collateral Agent shall determine (other than in violation of any then-existing licensing arrangements or other agreement to the extent that waivers cannot be obtained), but in any event, on a revocable basis under terms whereby such license should terminate immediately upon cure of an Event of Default in connection with exercise of its remedies hereunder, and (b) subject to Section 2.04, with or without legal process and with or without prior notice or demand for performance, to take possession of the Collateral and the Pledged Collateral and without liability for trespass to enter any premises where the Collateral or the Pledged Collateral may be located for the purpose of taking possession of or removing the Collateral and the Pledged Collateral and, generally, to exercise any and all rights afforded to a secured party under the PPSA, the STA or other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees that the Collateral Agent shall have the right, subject to the mandatory requirements of applicable law and the notice requirements described below, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Collateral at a public or private sale or at any broker’s board or on any securities exchange, for cash, upon credit or for future delivery as the Collateral Agent shall deem appropriate. The Collateral Agent shall be authorized at any such sale of securities (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to Persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the Collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the Collateral Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof the Collateral so sold. Each such purchaser at any sale of Collateral shall hold the property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of the applicable Grantor, and the applicable Grantor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and appraisal that the applicable Grantor now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) may also realize upon the Collateral and enforce its rights, by: (a) appointing a receiver (which term as used in this security agreement includes an interim receiver and a receiver and manager) or agent of all or any part of the Collateral and removing or replacing from time to time any receiver or agent and/or (b) instituting proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a receiver of all or any part of the Collateral. Any receiver appointed by the Collateral Agent shall be vested with all rights of the Collateral Agent and all of the remedies which could have been exercised by the Collateral Agent in respect of the Grantors or the Collateral and such other powers and discretions as are granted in the instrument of appointment and any supplemental instruments. The choice of receiver and its remuneration shall be within the sole discretion of the Collateral Agent. Any receiver appointed by the Collateral Agent shall act as agent for the Collateral Agent and the Purchasers for the purposes of taking possession of the Collateral, but otherwise and for all other purposes (except as provided below), as agent for the Grantors. The receiver may sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of Collateral as agent for the Grantors or as agent for the Collateral Agent as the Collateral Agent may determine in its sole discretion. The Grantors agree to ratify and confirm all actions of the receiver acting as agent for the Grantors, and to release and indemnify the receiver in respect of all such actions. The

-15- CAN_DMS: \149647507\7 Collateral Agent, in appointing or refraining from appointing any receiver, shall not incur any liability to the receiver, the Grantors or any other Person and shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence of such Person. The Collateral Agent shall give the Grantors no less than ten (10) days’ prior written notice of the Collateral Agent’s intention to make any sale of Collateral. Such notice, in the case of a public sale, shall state the time and place for such sale and, in the case of a sale at a broker’s board or on a securities exchange, shall state the board or exchange at which such sale is to be made and the day on which the Collateral or portion thereof, will first be offered for sale at such board or exchange. Any such public sale shall be held at such time or times within ordinary business hours and at such place or places as the Collateral Agent may fix and state in the notice (if any) of such sale. At any such sale, the Collateral, or portion thereof, to be sold may be sold in one lot as an entirety or in separate parcels, as the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) may (in their sole and absolute discretion) determine. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been given. The Collateral Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned. In case any sale of all or any part of the Collateral is made on credit or for future delivery, the Collateral so sold may be retained by the Collateral Agent until the sale price is paid by the purchaser or purchasers thereof, but the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall not incur any liability in case any such purchaser or purchasers shall fail to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold and, in case of any such failure, such Collateral may be sold again upon like notice. At any public (or, to the extent permitted by law, private) sale made pursuant to this Agreement, any Secured Party may bid for or purchase, free (to the extent permitted by law) from any right of redemption, stay, valuation or appraisal on the part of the Grantors (all said rights being also hereby waived and released to the extent permitted by law), the Collateral or any part thereof offered for sale and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable to such Secured Party from the Grantors as a credit against the purchase price, and such Secured Party may, upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further accountability to the Grantors therefor. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred upon it, the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose this Agreement and to sell the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court-appointed receiver. Any sale pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.01 shall be deemed to in accordance with any requirements under the PPSA or the STA or their equivalent in other jurisdictions. SECTION 4.02. Grant of License to Use Intellectual Property. For the exclusive purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent to exercise rights and remedies under this Agreement at such time as the Collateral Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each Grantor shall, upon prior written request by the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) at any time during the continuance of an Event of Default, grant to the Collateral Agent a nonexclusive, non- transferable irrevocable, royalty-free, limited license (until the termination or cure of the Event of Default) to use any of the Collateral consisting of Intellectual Property now owned or hereafter acquired by such Grantor, and wherever the same may be located, and including in such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 4.02 shall require any Grantor to grant any license that is prohibited by any rule of law, statute or regulation, or is prohibited by, or constitutes a breach or default under or results in the termination of any contract, license, agreement, instrument or other document with respect to such Intellectual Property, or gives any third party any right of acceleration, modification, termination or cancellation in any such document, or otherwise unreasonably prejudices the value of such Intellectual Property; provided further that such licenses to be

-16- CAN_DMS: \149647507\7 granted hereunder with respect to Trademarks shall be subject to the Collateral Agent’s maintenance of quality standards with respect to the goods and services on which such Trademarks are used sufficient to preserve the validity of such Trademarks. For the avoidance of doubt, the use of such license by the Collateral Agent may be exercised solely during the continuation of an Event of Default and upon termination of the Event of Default; such license to the Intellectual Property shall automatically and immediately terminate and any Intellectual Property in the possession of the Collateral Agent shall be returned to the applicable Grantor. ARTICLE V Miscellaneous SECTION 5.01. Notices. All communications and notices hereunder shall (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein) be in writing and given as provided in the Note Purchase Agreement. SECTION 5.02. Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Note Document shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties hereunder and under the other Note Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that the Collateral Agent or the other Secured Parties would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by any Note Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section 5.02, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the purchase of a Note shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default hereunder, regardless of whether the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time. No notice or demand on any Note Party in any case shall entitle any Note Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Collateral Agent and the Grantors with respect to which such waiver, amendment or modification is to apply, subject to any consent required in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement; provided that the Collateral Agent may, without the consent of any other Secured Party, consent to a departure by the any of Grantors from any covenant set forth herein to the extent such departure is consistent with the authority of the Collateral Agent or Collateral Agent set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement. SECTION 5.03. Collateral Agent’s Fees and Expenses; Indemnification. (a) Each Grantor agrees to reimburse the Collateral Agent and the Purchasers for any Collateral Agent Expenses and Purchasers’ Expenses incurred hereunder as provided in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 of the Note Purchase Agreement and to indemnify the Collateral Agent and the Purchasers in accordance with Section 13.2(a) of the Note Purchase Agreement; provided that each reference therein to the “Issuer” shall be deemed to be a reference to “the Grantors”, “each Grantor” or “any Grantor, as applicable. (b) The provisions of this Section 5.03 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of the termination of this Agreement or any other Note Document, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the repayment of any of the Secured Obligations, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other Note Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of any Secured Party. All amounts due under this Section 5.03 shall be payable not later than twenty (20) Business Days after written demand therefor; provided, however, any

-17- CAN_DMS: \149647507\7 Indemnitee shall promptly refund an indemnification payment received hereunder to the extent that there is a final judicial determination that such Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification with respect to such payment pursuant to this Section 5.03. Any such amounts payable as provided hereunder shall be additional Secured Obligations. SECTION 5.04. Successors and Assigns. Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the permitted successors and assigns of such party, and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the Grantors or the Collateral Agent that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns. SECTION 5.05. Survival of Agreement. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Grantors in this Agreement or any other Note Document and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Note Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Secured Parties and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Note Documents and the purchase of any Notes, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Secured Party and notwithstanding that the Collateral Agent, the Purchasers or any other Secured Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended under the Note Purchase Agreement or any other Note Document, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Termination Date has occurred, in each case, in accordance with and subject to the limitations set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement. SECTION 5.06. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Several Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of each of the Grantors and shall have been delivered to the Collateral Agent and a counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the Collateral Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon the Grantors and the Collateral Agent and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Grantors, the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Grantors shall not have the right to assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any such assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly provided in this Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement. SECTION 5.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. SECTION 5.08. Right of Set-off. If an Event of Default under the Note Purchase Agreement shall have occurred and be continuing, each Purchaser and its respective Affiliates are hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency, but not withholding or payroll accounts, employee benefits accounts, de minimis accounts or other accounts used exclusively for taxes or fiduciary or trust purposes) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Purchaser or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of each Grantor against any of and all the obligations of such Grantor then due and owing under this Agreement held by such Purchaser, irrespective of whether or not such Purchaser shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although (i) such obligations may be contingent or unmatured and (ii)

-18- CAN_DMS: \149647507\7 such obligations are owed to a branch or office of such Purchaser different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such Debt. The applicable Purchaser shall notify the applicable Grantor and the Collateral Agent of such setoff and application; provided that any failure to give or any delay in giving such notice shall not affect the validity of any such setoff and application under this Section 5.08. The rights of each Purchaser and its Affiliates under this Section 5.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Purchaser and its Affiliates may have.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall have the right, but only upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, with full power of substitution either in the Collateral Agent’s name or in the name of each Grantor: (a) to receive, indorse, assign and/or deliver any and all notes, acceptances, cheques, drafts, money orders or other evidences of payment relating to the Collateral or any part thereof; (b) to demand, collect, receive payment of, give receipt for and give discharges and releases of all or any of the Collateral; (c) to sign the name of each Grantor on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the Collateral; (d) to send verifications of accounts receivable to any Account Debtor; (e) to commence and prosecute any and all suits, actions or proceedings at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect or otherwise realize on all or any of the Collateral or to enforce any rights in respect of any Collateral; (f) to settle, compromise, compound, adjust or defend any actions, suits or proceedings relating to all or any of the Collateral; (g) to the extent the Notes have been accelerated pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, to

The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts actually received as a result of the exercise of the powers granted to them herein, and neither they nor their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to the Grantors for any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or that of any of their controlled Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents or attorneys-in-fact. The provisions of Exhibit C of the Note Purchase Agreement, including the rights, privileges, protections, benefits, indemnities and immunities of the Collateral Agent are incorporated herein, mutatis mutandis, as if a part hereof, and shall also apply to the Collateral Agent acting under or in connection with this Agreement. If the Collateral Agent has a right to take or omit to take any action hereunder, it shall exercise such right if so instructed by the Required Purchasers. With respect to any discretion, consent, approval or similar such action to be made, taken, omitted to be taken or determined by the Collateral Agent under this Agreement (each an “Agent Determination”), such Agent Determination shall be made by the Collateral Agent at the direction of the Required Purchasers. SECTION 5.15. Further Assurances. Each Grantor shall from time to time, whether before or after the pledge and security interest has become enforceable, do all acts and things and execute and deliver all transfers, assignments and agreements as the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) may reasonably require for (a) protecting the Collateral, (b) perfecting the Collateral and the security interest, (c) obtaining control of the Collateral, (d) exercising all powers, authorities and discretions conferred upon the Collateral Agent, and (e) otherwise enabling the Collateral Agent to obtain the full benefits of this security agreement and the rights and powers herein granted. Each Grantor shall, from time to time after the pledge and security interest has become enforceable, do all acts and things and execute and deliver all transfers, assignments and agreements as the Collateral Agent (at the direction of the Required Purchasers) may require for facilitating the sale or other disposition of the Collateral in connection with its realization. SECTION 5.16. Judgment Currency. (a) If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due to a Secured Party in any currency (the “Original Currency”) into another currency (the “Other Currency”), the parties agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures, such Secured Party could purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency on the Business Day preceding the day on which final judgment is given or, if permitted by applicable law, on the day on which the judgment is paid or satisfied. (b) The obligations of a Grantor in respect of any sum due in the Original Currency from it to any Secured Party under this Agreement shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any Other Currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Secured Party of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Other Currency, such Secured Party may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase the Original Currency with such Other Currency. If the amount of the Original Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Secured Party in the Original Currency,

-21- CAN_DMS: \149647507\7 such Grantor agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding the judgment, to indemnify such Secured Party against any loss, and, if the amount of the Original Currency so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to such Secured Party in the Original Currency, such Secured Party shall remit such excess such Grantor. SECTION 5.17. Amalgamation. If any Grantor amalgamates with any other corporation or corporations, it is the intention of the parties that the Security Interest will (a) extend to all of the property, assets and interests that (i) any of the amalgamating corporations own, or (ii) the amalgamated corporation thereafter acquires, and (b) secure the payment and performance of all debts, liabilities and obligations of any of the amalgamating corporations and the amalgamated corporation to the Collateral Agent, however or wherever incurred and whether as principal, guarantor or surety and whether incurred prior to, at the time of, or subsequent to, the amalgamation. The Security Interest will attach to the property, assets and interests of the amalgamating corporations not previously subject to this Agreement at the time of amalgamation and to any property, assets or interests thereafter owned or acquired by the amalgamated corporation when such property, assets or interests become owned or are acquired. Upon any such amalgamation, the defined term “Grantor” shall include each of the amalgamating corporations and the amalgamated corporation, the defined term Collateral shall include all of the property, assets and interests described in (a) above, and the defined term Obligations shall include the obligations described in (b) above.
