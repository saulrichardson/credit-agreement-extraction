US-DOCS\117850317.3 MASTER SCOOTER OPERATING LEASE AND SERVICING AGREEMENT This Master Scooter Operating Lease and Servicing Agreement (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the provisions hereof, this “Agreement”), dated as of April 27, 2021, by and among: BIRD US OPCO, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as lessor (in such capacity, the “Lessor”); and BIRD RIDES, INC., a Delaware corporation (“Bird”), as a lessee (in such capacity, the “Lessee”) and as servicer (in such capacity as servicer, the “Servicer”). RECITALS WHEREAS, the Lessor has entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the “Loan Agreement”), dated as of April 27, 2021, among the Lessor, Bird US Holdco, LLC, the lenders party thereto and MidCap Financial Trust, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the “Administrative Agent”), in order to finance the acquisition of a fleet of electric scooters (the “Scooters’) that the Lessor determines shall be leased hereunder; WHEREAS, the Lessor desires to lease to the Lessee, and the Lessee desires to lease from the Lessor, the Scooters for use in connection with the business of the Lessee; WHEREAS, the Lessor and the Lessee each desire that the Servicer perform various servicing functions with respect to the Scooters, and the Servicer desires to perform such functions, in accordance with the terms hereof; NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows: AGREEMENT 1. DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION 1.1. Definitions.

[[A0060]]
As used in this Agreement and unless the context requires a different meaning, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Schedule I hereto and, if not defined therein, shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Loan Agreement. 1.2. Construction. (a) In this Agreement, including the preamble, recitals, attachments, schedules, annexes, exhibits and joinders hereto, unless the context otherwise requires: (i) the singular includes the plural and vice versa; (ii) references to an agreement or document shall include the preamble, recitals, all attachments, schedules, annexes, exhibits and joinders to such agreement or document, and are to such agreement or document (including all such attachments, schedules, annexes, exhibits and joinders to such agreement or

[[A0061]]
2 US-DOCS\137537508.5 document) as amended, supplemented, restated and otherwise modified from time to time and to any successor or replacement agreement or document, as applicable (unless otherwise stated); (iii) reference to any Person includes such Person’s successors and assigns but, if applicable, only if such successors and assigns are permitted by this Agreement, and reference to any Person in a particular capacity only refers to such Person in such capacity; (iv) reference to any gender includes the other gender; (v) reference to any Requirement of Law means such Requirement of Law as amended, modified, codified or reenacted, in whole or in part, and in effect from time to time; (vi) “including” (and with correlative meaning “include”) means including without limiting the generality of any description preceding such term; (vii) with respect to the determination of any period of time, “from” means “from and including” and “to” means “to but excluding”; (viii) the language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any party; (ix) as used in this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, the term “title” refers to a Certificate of Title or other similar form of vehicle title and is intended by each party hereto to include the terms “vehicle registration” and “vehicle license plate,” unless specified otherwise; and (x) unless specified otherwise, “titling” will be deemed to include the acts of registering a scooter, including the registering of the license plates of a scooter. (b) Notwithstanding any language to the contrary contained herein, the parties hereto intend that this Agreement constitutes one indivisible lease of the Scooters and not separate leases governed by similar terms.

[[A0062]]
The Scooters constitute one economic unit, and the Rent and all other provisions hereof have been negotiated and agreed to based upon a demise of all of the Scooters to the Lessees as a single, composite, inseparable transaction and would have been substantially different had separate leases or a divisible lease been intended.

[[A0063]]
The parties intend that the provisions of this Agreement shall at all times be construed, interpreted and applied so as to carry out their mutual objective to create an indivisible lease of all of the Scooters and, in particular but without limitation, that, for purposes of any assumption, rejection or assignment of this Agreement under 11 U.S.C. Section 365, or any successor or replacement thereof or any analogous state law, this is one indivisible lease and non-severable lease and executory contract dealing with one legal and economic unit and that this Agreement must be assumed, rejected or assigned as a whole with respect to all (and only as to all) of the Scooters.

[[A0064]]
Except as expressly provided in this Agreement for specific, isolated purposes (and then only to the extent expressly otherwise stated), all provisions of this Agreement apply equally and uniformly to all of the Scooters as one unit.

[[A0065]]
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Operating Lease Event of Default, the Lessor shall be entitled to exercise any applicable

[[A0066]]
3 US-DOCS\137537508.5 remedies under Section 9 with respect to all of the Scooters or any portion of the Scooters, regardless of the portion of the Scooters to which such Operating Lease Event of Default relates.

[[A0067]]
The parties may amend this Agreement from time to time to add or remove one or more additional scooters as part of the Scooters and such future addition to, or removal from, the Scooters shall not in any way change the indivisible and non- severable nature of this Agreement and all of the foregoing provisions shall continue to apply in full force.

[[A0068]]
Each party agrees that it shall not assert that this Agreement is not, and shall not challenge the characterization of this Agreement as, a single indivisible lease of all of the Scooters.

[[A0069]]
Each party hereby waives any claim or defense based on a recharacterization of this Agreement as any agreement other than a single indivisible lease of all of the Scooters. 2. NATURE OF AGREEMENT. (a) The Lessee and the Lessor intend that this Agreement is a lease and that the relationship between the Lessor and the Lessee pursuant hereto shall always be only that of lessor and lessee, and the Lessee hereby declares, acknowledges and agrees that the Lessor is the owner of the Scooters, and legal title to the Scooters is held by the Lessor directly.

[[A0070]]
The Lessee shall not acquire by virtue of this Agreement any right, equity, title or interest in or to any Scooters, except the leasehold interest established by this Agreement.

[[A0071]]
The parties agree that this Agreement is a “true lease” and agree to treat the leasehold interest established by this Agreement as a lease for all purposes, including accounting, regulatory and otherwise, except it will be disregarded for tax purposes to the extent the Lessor and the Lessee are treated as the same taxpayer under the Code or under applicable state tax laws. (b) GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST.

[[A0072]]
To secure the prompt and complete payment and performance when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of all of the obligations and liabilities of the Lessee under this Agreement, the Lessee hereby grants to the Lessor a security interest in all of the Lessee’s right, title and interest, if any, in and to all of the following assets, property and interests in property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired or created (collectively, the “Collateral”): (i) the rights of the Lessee under this Agreement, as such Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with its terms, and any other agreements related to or in connection with this Agreement, to which the Lessee is a party (the “Lessee Agreements”), including, without limitation, (a) all monies, if any, due and to become due to the Lessee from any other Person under or in connection with any of the Lessee Agreements or Rider Contracts in connection with the use of Scooters, whether payable as rent, guaranty payments, fees, expenses, costs, indemnities, insurance recoveries, damages for the breach of any of the Lessee Agreements or otherwise, and (b) all rights, remedies, powers, privileges, liens and claims of the Lessee against any other party under or with respect to the Lessee Agreements (whether arising pursuant to the terms of such Lessee Agreements or otherwise available to the Lessee at law or in equity), including the right to enforce any of the Lessee Agreements and to give or withhold any and all consents, requests, notices, directions, approvals, extensions or waivers under or with respect to the Lessee Agreements or the obligations and liabilities of any party thereunder; (ii) [reserved];

[[A0073]]
4 US-DOCS\137537508.5 (iii) all right, title and interest of the Lessee in and to any Proceeds from the sale of the Scooters leased hereunder which, notwithstanding that this Agreement is intended to convey only a leasehold interest, are determined to be owned by the Lessee, including all monies due in respect of such Scooters, whether payable as the purchase price of such Scooters, as auction sales proceeds, or as fees, expenses, costs, indemnities, insurance recoveries, or otherwise; (iv) all payments under insurance policies (whether or not the Lessor or the Administrative Agent is named as the loss payee thereof) or any warranty payable by reason of loss or damage to, or otherwise with respect to, any of the Scooters leased hereunder solely to the extent attributable to a casualty event with respect to the Scooters; (v) all additional property that may from time to time hereafter become part of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Documents; and (vi) all Proceeds of any and all of the foregoing including, without limitation, cash and payments under insurance (whether or not the Lessor is named as the loss payee thereof).

[[A0074]]
The Lessee hereby acknowledges that the Lessor has granted to the Administrative Agent, pursuant to the Loan Agreement, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a first priority security interest in all of Lessor’s right, title and interest in and to the Scooters and this Agreement as collateral security for the prompt and complete payment and performance when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of all of the obligations and liabilities of the Lessor, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, due or to become due, or now existing or hereafter incurred, which may arise under, out of, or in connection with, the Loan Agreement and any other document made, delivered or given in connection therewith, whether on account of rent, principal, interest, reimbursement obligations, fees, indemnities, costs, or expenses (including all fees and disbursements of counsel to the Lessor and the Administrative Agent that are required to be paid by the Lessee pursuant to the terms hereof). (c) The Lessee agrees to deliver to the Lessor and the Administrative Agent on or before the Operating Lease Commencement Date: (i) a written search report from a Person satisfactory to the Lessor and the Administrative Agent listing all effective financing statements that name the Lessee as debtor or assignor, and that are filed in the jurisdictions in which filings were made pursuant to clause (ii) below, together with copies of such financing statements, and tax and judgment lien search reports from a Person satisfactory to the Lessor and the Administrative Agent showing no evidence of liens filed against the Lessee that purport to affect any Scooters leased hereunder or any Collateral under the Loan Agreement; and (ii) draft financing statements on Form UCC-1 to be filed in the jurisdiction where the Lessee is located under Section 9-307 of the UCC naming the Lessee, as debtor, the Lessor, as secured party, and the Administrative Agent, as assignee of the secured party, covering the Collateral described in Section 2(b) hereof.

[[A0184]]
No delay or omission of the Lessor in the exercise of any such power or remedy and no renewal or extension of any payments due hereunder will impair any such power or remedy or will be construed to be a waiver of any default or any acquiescence therein.

[[A0186]]

[[A0204]]
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to restrict the right of the Lessee to acquire or dispose of, by purchase, lease, financing, or otherwise, scooters that are not subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

[[A0205]]
24 US-DOCS\137537508.5 (ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Lessee (and the Servicer, if the Servicer is the same Person as the Lessee) may enter into a transaction constituting a Qualifying IPO so long as, upon completion of such Qualifying IPO, the Lessee (and the Servicer, if the Servicer is the same Person as the Lessee) is the surviving entity or the entity that survives such Qualifying IPO expressly assumes all obligations of the Lessee (and the Servicer, if the Servicer is the same Person as the Lessee) hereunder.
