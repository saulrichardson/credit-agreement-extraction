In the event that your employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by you for Good Reason anytime on or after the first anniversary of the Grant Date, except as otherwise set forth in Section 3(a)(iv)(A), then a portion of your RSUs determined by multiplying the number of RSUs granted hereunder by the applicable Pro-Ration Fraction (rounded down to the nearest whole Share) shall immediately vest and any other RSUs shall be forfeited immediately upon such termination of employment. For the avoidance of doubt, if such termination of employment occurs before the first anniversary of the Grant Date, then all then outstanding RSUs shall be immediately forfeited as of the date of termination and you will not be entitled to any further payments or benefits with respect to such forfeited RSUs.

(iii)
Death or Disability.
In the event that your employment is terminated due to death or Disability on or after the first anniversary of the Grant Date, the service requirements shall no longer apply and you or your estate or applicable beneficiary, as the case may be, shall immediately vest in a portion of your RSUs determined by multiplying the number of RSUs granted hereunder by the applicable Pro-Ration Fraction (rounded up to the nearest whole Share).

- Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Change of Control before the Vesting Date, unless (I) the unvested but outstanding RSUs remain outstanding following such Change of Control in accordance with Section 3(a)(iv)(A) above and (II) the material terms and conditions of such RSUs as in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control are preserved following the Change of Control (including with respect to the vesting schedules), any outstanding unvested RSUs will automatically vest and all forfeiture provisions related thereto will lapse as of such date.

SECTION 4. Settlement. Subject to Section 3, 5, and 8 of this Award Agreement, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to you one or more unlegended, freely-transferable stock certificates or book entry credits in respect of the Shares underlying the RSUs subject to this Award and any accrued cash dividends related thereto within 30 days following the Vesting Date.

Forfeiture of RSUs.

- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Award Agreement, in the event that you incur a termination of employment by the Company without Cause or due to Disability or by you for Good Reason, in order for the RSUs to vest as provided in Section 3(a)(ii) or (iii), you must sign a customary release of claims in favor of the Company and its Affiliates that is acceptable to the Company, and such release must become effective and irrevocable on or before the 65th day following your termination of employment. In the event you do not sign such release or revoke such release before it becomes effective, you will forfeit all rights to any unvested RSUs. In addition, in the event that (i) you violate the Restrictive Covenants, (ii) you engage in any conduct constituting Cause, (iii) a “Forfeiture Event” (as defined in the Clawback Policy) with respect to you occurs or (iv) you otherwise violate the Clawback Policy or any other recoupment or clawback policy adopted by the Company, as may be amended from time to time, to the extent necessary to address the requirements of applicable law (including Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as codified in Section 10D of the Exchange Act, Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any other applicable law), all outstanding RSUs shall be forfeited and canceled. In addition, you acknowledge and agree that this Award, including all Shares delivered to you, if any, pursuant to this Award and any dividend amounts paid pursuant to Section 6 and any other “Incentive Compensation” (as defined in the Clawback Policy) granted, paid, delivered, awarded or otherwise provided to you are subject to all terms and conditions of the Clawback Policy or any other recoupment or clawback policy adopted by the Company, as may be amended from time to time.

Prior to the date on which Shares are delivered to you in settlement of the RSUs pursuant to this Award Agreement, you shall not have any rights of a stockholder with respect to the Shares underlying the RSUs (including any voting rights or rights with respect to dividends). Instead, if the Company declares and pays (or sets a record date with respect to) ordinary cash dividends on Shares on or after the Grant Date and prior to the settlement of the RSUs, subject to Section 5 above and 8 below, an amount equal to the ordinary cash dividends that would have been payable to you with respect to the Shares underlying the RSUs as if those Shares had been issued and outstanding as of the applicable dividend payment dates shall be held by the Company or an escrow agent that is designated by the Company and shall be paid (less any taxes required to be withheld) at the time the corresponding RSUs are paid (it being understood that the provisions of this sentence shall not apply to any extraordinary dividends or distributions). For the avoidance of doubt, dividends shall not be payable with respect to any RSUs that do not vest in accordance with their terms.
