1.    EXERCISE OF WARRANT.

[[A0013]]

[[A0014]]
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein at any time beginning on or after the date hereof (the “ Initial Exercise Date ”) and ending on or before 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the fifth anniversary of the Initial Exercise Date (the “ Expiration Date ”), the Warrantholder is entitled to purchase from the Company up to [●] shares of the Company’s Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “ Common Stock ”) (as adjusted from time to time pursuant to the provisions of this Warrant) (the “ Warrant Shares ”), at a purchase price of $[1.30] per share (the “ Exercise Price ”) (subject to the earlier termination of this Warrant as set forth herein).

[[A0015]]

[[A0016]]
- wire transfer to the Company or cashier’s check drawn on a United States bank made payable to the order of the Company, or

[[A0017]]
- exercising of the right to credit the Exercise Price against the Fair Market Value of the Warrant Shares (as defined below) at the time of exercise (the “
Net Exercise
”) pursuant to
Section 1(c)
.

[[A0018]]
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Warrantholder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company until the Warrantholder has purchased all of the Warrant Shares available hereunder and the Warrant has been exercised in full, in which case, the Warrantholder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation within three (3) trading days of the date the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company.

[[A0019]]
Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased.

[[A0020]]
The Warrantholder and the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases.

[[A0021]]
- Net Exercise . If the Company shall receive written notice from the Warrantholder at the time of exercise of this Warrant that the Warrantholder elects to Net Exercise the Warrant, the Company shall deliver to such Warrantholder (without payment by the Warrantholder of any exercise price in cash) that number of Warrant Shares computed using the following formula:

[[A0022]]
X = Y (A - B)

[[A0023]]
A

[[A0024]]
Where

[[A0025]]
X =        The number of Warrant Shares to be issued to the Warrantholder.

[[A0026]]
Y =    The number of Warrant Shares purchasable under this Warrant or, if only a portion of this Warrant is being exercised, the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is being exercised.

[[A0027]]
A =       The Fair Market Value of one (1) share of Common Stock on the trading date immediately preceding the date on which Warrantholder elects to exercise this Warrant.

[[A0028]]
B =        The Exercise Price (as adjusted hereunder).

[[A0029]]
The “ Fair Market Value ” of one share of Common Stock shall mean (x) the last reported sale price of the Common Stock on the business day prior to the date of exercise on the Trading Market on which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets (or a comparable reporting service of national reputation selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to the holder if Bloomberg Financial Markets is not then reporting sales prices of the Common Stock) (collectively, “ Bloomberg ”), (y) if the foregoing does not apply, an average of the closing price of the Common Stock on the previous twenty (20) business days prior to the date of exercise in the OTC Markets, on the pink sheets or bulletin board for such security as reported by Bloomberg or, (z) if fair market value cannot be calculated as of such date on either of the foregoing bases, the price determined in good faith by the Company’s Board of Directors.

[[A0030]]
“OTC Markets ” shall mean either OTC QX or OTC QB tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. (or any successors to any of the foregoing).

[[A0031]]

[[A0032]]
- Deemed Exercise .

[[A0033]]
In the event that immediately prior to the close of business on the Expiration Date, the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock (as determined in accordance with Section 1(c) above) is greater than the then applicable Exercise Price, this Warrant shall be deemed to be automatically exercised on a net exercise issue basis pursuant to Section 1(c) above, and the Company shall deliver the applicable number of Warrant Shares to the Warrantholder pursuant to the provisions of Section 1(c) above and this Section 1(d) .

[[A0034]]
2.    CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS.

[[A0035]]
- Adjustment of Number of Warrant Shares and Exercise Price . The number and kind of Warrant Shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant and the Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

[[A0036]]
- Subdivisions, Combinations and Other Issuances . If the Company shall at any time after the Date of Issuance but prior to the Expiration Date subdivide its shares of capital stock of the same class as the Warrant Shares, by split-up or otherwise, or combine such shares of capital stock, or issue additional shares of capital stock as a dividend with respect to any shares of such capital stock, or effect any forward stock split or reverse stock split of its capital stock of the same class as the Warrant Shares, the number of Warrant Shares issuable on the exercise of this Warrant shall forthwith be proportionately increased in the case of a subdivision, stock dividend or forward stock split, or proportionately decreased in the case of a reverse stock split or other combination.

[[A0037]]
Appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the Exercise Price payable per share, but the aggregate Exercise Price payable for the total number of Warrant Shares purchasable under this Warrant (as adjusted) shall remain the same.

[[A0038]]
Any adjustment under this Section 2(a)(1) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective, or as of the record date of such dividend, or in the event that no record date is fixed, upon the making of such dividend.

[[A0039]]
- Reclassification, Reorganizations and Consolidation . In case of any reclassification, capital reorganization or change in the capital stock of the Company (other than as a result of a subdivision, combination or stock dividend provided for in Section 2(a)(1) above) that occurs after the Date of Issuance (whether prior to, on or subsequent to the Initial Exercise Date), then, as a condition of such reclassification, reorganization or change, lawful provision shall be made, and duly executed documents evidencing the same from the Company or its successor shall be delivered to the Warrantholder, so that the Warrantholder shall thereafter have the right at any time prior to the Expiration Date to purchase, at a total price equal to that payable upon the exercise of this Warrant, the kind and amount of shares of stock and/or other securities or property (including, if applicable, cash) receivable in connection with such reclassification, reorganization or change by a holder of the same number and type of securities as were purchasable as Warrant Shares by the Warrantholders immediately prior to such reclassification, reorganization or change.

[[A0040]]
In any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interest of the Warrantholder so that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable with respect to any shares of stock or other securities or property deliverable upon exercise hereof, and appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Exercise Price payable hereunder, provided the aggregate Exercise Price shall remain the same (and, for the avoidance of doubt, this Warrant shall be exclusively exercisable for such shares of stock and/or other securities or property from and after the consummation of such reclassification or other change in the capital stock of the Company).

[[A0041]]
(b)
Notice to Warrantholder
.

[[A0042]]
If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding (whether prior to, on or subsequent to the Initial Exercise Date), the Company (i) declares a dividend or any other distribution of cash, securities or other property in respect of its Common Stock, including, without limitation, any granting of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any capital stock of the Company or any subsidiary, (ii) authorizes or approves, enters into any agreement contemplating or solicits stockholder approval for any Fundamental Transaction or (iii) authorizes the voluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then the Company shall deliver to the Warrantholder a notice of such transaction at least ten (10) business days prior to the applicable record or effective date on which a person would need to hold Common Stock in order to participate in or vote with respect to such transaction; provided, however, that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be described in such notice.

[[A0043]]
- Calculations . All calculations under this Section 2 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest whole share, as the case may be.

[[A0044]]
For purposes of this Section 2 , the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding.

[[A0045]]
- Treatment of Warrant upon a Fundamental Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another person or group of persons whereby such other person or group acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other person or other persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a “ Fundamental Transaction ”), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Warrantholder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, at the option of the Warrantholder, the number, class, and series of shares of capital stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the “ Alternate Consideration ”) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction.

[[A0046]]
For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration.

[[A0047]]
If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Warrantholder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction.

[[A0048]]
The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the “ Successor Entity ”) to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other transaction documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2(d) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Warrantholder and approved by the Warrantholder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Warrantholder, deliver to the Warrantholder in exchange for this Warrant a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant which is exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Warrantholder.

[[A0049]]
Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Warrant and the other transaction documents referring to the “Company” shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant and the other transaction documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein.

[[A0050]]
3.    NO FRACTIONAL SHARES.

[[A0051]]
No fractional Warrant Shares or scrip representing fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of this Warrant.

[[A0052]]

[[A0053]]
4.    NO STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS.

[[A0054]]
Until the exercise of this Warrant or any portion of this Warrant, the Warrantholder shall not have, nor exercise, any rights as a stockholder of the Company (including without limitation the right to notification of stockholder meetings or the right to receive any notice or other communication concerning the business and affairs of the Company) except as provided in Section 8 below.

[[A0057]]
This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise as provided above, and the person entitled to receive the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise shall be treated for all purposes as the holder of such shares of record as of the close of business on such date.

[[A0058]]
Warrant Shares purchased hereunder shall be transmitted by the Company’s transfer agent to the holder by crediting the account of the holder’s prime broker with The Depository Trust Company through its Deposit or Withdrawal at Custodian system (“ DWAC ”) if the Company is then a participant in such system and either (A) there is an effective registration statement covering the resale of the Warrant Shares by the holder and the Warrantholder has certified to the Company that it has sold or otherwise disposed of the Warrant Shares in accordance with the plan of distribution set forth in such registration statement, (B) the shares are eligible for resale by the holder pursuant to Rule 144 and the Warrantholder has certified to the Company that it has sold the Warrant Shares in accordance with the requirements of such Rule,or (C) the shares have been exercised on a cashless basis and are eligible for resale by the holder pursuant to Rule 144 without volume or manner of sale limitations, and otherwise in book entry form or by physical delivery to the address specified by the holder in the Notice of Exercise by the end of the day (such date, the “ Warrant Share Delivery Date ”) on the date that is not more than two (2) trading days after the latest of (A) the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise, (b) surrender of this Warrant (if required), and (C) payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (unless exercised by means of a cashless exercise pursuant to Section 1(c) ).

[[A0059]]

6.    CERTIFICATE OF ADJUSTMENT.

[[A0061]]

[[A0062]]
7.    COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS.

[[A0063]]
- The Warrantholder understands that this Warrant and the Warrant Shares are characterized as “restricted securities” under the federal securities laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from the Company in a transaction not involving a public offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations this Warrant and the Warrant Shares may be resold without registration under the Securities Act only in certain limited circumstances.

[[A0067]]
- The Warrantholder acknowledges that the Company may place a restrictive legend on the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in order to comply with applicable securities laws, in substantially the following form and substance, unless such Warrant Shares are freely tradable, without restriction, under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration statement.:

[[A0068]]
“THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS BOOK-ENTRY POSITION HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED THEREUNDER (THE “ SECURITIES ACT ”), OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND NEITHER SUCH SECURITIES NOR ANY INTEREST THEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED, ASSIGNED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED UNLESS (1) A REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH RESPECT THERETO IS EFFECTIVE UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, OR (2) AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION EXISTS AND THE COMPANY RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, WHICH COUNSEL AND OPINION ARE REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, THAT SUCH SECURITIES MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED, ASSIGNED OR TRANSFERRED IN THE MANNER CONTEMPLATED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.”

[[A0069]]
8.    REPLACEMENT OF WARRANTS.

[[A0070]]

[[A0071]]
9.    NO IMPAIRMENT.

[[A0072]]
Except to the extent as may be waived by the holder of this Warrant, the Company will not, by amendment of its charter or through a Fundamental Transaction, dissolution, sale of assets or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Warrantholder against impairment.

[[A0073]]

[[A0074]]
TRADING DAYS.

[[A0075]]
