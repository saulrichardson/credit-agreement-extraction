1.2.

Prepayment
. So long as no Event of Default (as defined below) has occurred, Borrower shall have the right, exercisable on
not less than five (5) Trading Days prior written notice to Lender to prepay the Outstanding Balance (less such portion of the Outstanding

In the event Borrower delivers the Optional Prepayment Amount to Lender prior to the Optional Prepayment Date, the Optional Prepayment
Amount shall not be deemed to have been paid to Lender until the Optional Prepayment Date. In the event Borrower delivers the Optional
Prepayment Amount without an Optional Prepayment Notice, then the Optional Prepayment Date will be deemed to be the date that is five

and fails to pay the Optional Prepayment Amount due to Lender within five (5) Trading Days following the Optional Prepayment Date, Borrower
shall forever forfeit its right to prepay this Note.

4.2.

Trigger Event Remedies . At any time following the occurrence of any Trigger Event, Lender may, at its option, increase the Outstanding Balance by applying the Trigger Effect.

4.3.

Defaults . At any time following the occurrence of a Trigger Event, Lender may, at its option, send written notice to Borrower demanding that Borrower cure the Trigger Event within ten (10) Trading Days following the date of such written notice. If Borrower fails to cure the Trigger Event within the required ten (10) Trading Day cure period, the Trigger Event will automatically become an event of default hereunder (each, an “ Event of Default ”).

4.4.

Default Remedies . At any time and from time to time following the occurrence of any Event of Default, Lender may accelerate this Note by written notice to Borrower, with the Outstanding Balance becoming immediately due and payable in cash at the Mandatory Default Amount.). Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of any Trigger Event described in clauses 4.1(c) – 4.1(g), an Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred and the Outstanding Balance as of the date of the occurrence of such Trigger Event shall become immediately and automatically due and payable in cash at the Mandatory Default Amount, without any written notice required by Lender for the Trigger Event to become an Event of Default. At any time following the occurrence of any Event of Default, upon written notice given by Lender to Borrower, interest shall accrue on the Outstanding Balance beginning on the date the applicable Event of Default occurred at an interest rate equal to the lesser of fifteen percent (15%) per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law (“ Default Interest ”). For the avoidance of doubt, Lender may continue making Conversions at any time following a Trigger Event or an Event of Default until such time as the Note is paid in full. In connection with acceleration described herein, Lender need not provide, and Borrower hereby waives, any presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, and Lender may immediately and without expiration of any grace period enforce any and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and all other remedies available to it under applicable law. Such acceleration may be rescinded and annulled by Lender at any time prior to payment hereunder and Lender shall have all rights as a holder of the Note until such time, if any, that Lender receives full payment pursuant to this Section 4.4. No such rescission or annulment shall affect any subsequent Trigger Event or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Nothing herein shall limit Lender’s right to pursue any other remedies available to it at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to Borrower’s failure to timely deliver Conversion Shares upon Conversion of the Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof.

5. Unconditional Obligation; No Offset . Borrower acknowledges that this Note is an unconditional, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Borrower not subject to offset, deduction or counterclaim of any kind. Borrower hereby waives any rights of offset it now has or may have hereafter against Lender, its successors and assigns, and agrees to make the payments or Conversions called for herein in accordance with the terms of this Note.

6. Waiver . No waiver of any provision of this Note shall be effective unless it is in the form of a writing signed by the party granting the waiver. No waiver of any provision or consent to any prohibited action shall constitute a waiver of any other provision or consent to any other prohibited action, whether or not similar. No waiver or consent shall constitute a continuing waiver or consent or commit a party to provide a waiver or consent in the future except to the extent specifically set forth in writing.

7. Rights Upon Issuance of Securities .

7.1.

Subsequent Equity Sales . If Borrower or any subsidiary thereof, as applicable, at any time this Note is outstanding, shall sell, issue or grant any Class A Ordinary Shares, option to purchase Class A Ordinary Shares, right to reprice, preferred shares convertible into Class A Ordinary Shares, debt, warrants, options or other instruments or securities which are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Class A Ordinary Shares to Lender or any third party (collectively, the “ Equity Securities ”), including without limitation any Deemed Issuance, at an effective price per share less than the then effective Lender Conversion Price (such issuance is referred to herein as a “ Dilutive Issuance ”), then, the Lender Conversion Price shall be automatically reduced and only reduced to equal such lower effective price per share, provided that the Lender Conversion Price shall in no event be less than the Floor Price. If the holder of any Equity Securities so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options, or rights per share which are issued in connection with such Dilutive Issuance, be entitled to receive Class A Ordinary Shares at an effective price per share that is less than the Lender Conversion Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Lender Conversion Price on the date of such Dilutive Issuance, and the then effective Lender Conversion Price shall be reduced and only reduced to equal such lower effective price per share. Such adjustments described above to the Lender Conversion Price shall be permanent (subject to additional adjustments under this section), and shall be made whenever such Equity Securities are issued. Borrower shall notify Lender, in writing, no later than the Trading Day following the issuance of any Equity Securities subject to this Section 7.1, indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price, or other pricing terms (such notice, the “ Dilutive Issuance Notice ”). For purposes of clarity, whether or not Borrower provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section 7.1, upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, on the date of such Dilutive Issuance the Lender Conversion Price shall be lowered to equal the applicable effective price per share regardless of whether Borrower or Lender accurately refers to such lower effective price per share in any subsequent Installment Notice or Lender Conversion Notice.

7.2.

Adjustment of Lender Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Class A Ordinary Shares . Without limiting any provision hereof, if Borrower at any time on or after the Effective Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares into a greater number of shares, the Lender Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. Without limiting any provision hereof, if Borrower at any time on or after the Effective Date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares into a smaller number of shares, the Lender Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. If any event requiring an adjustment under this Section 7.2 occurs during the period that a Redemption Conversion Price is calculated hereunder, then the calculation of such Redemption Conversion Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event.

7.3.

Other Events . In the event that Borrower (or any subsidiary) shall take any action to which the provisions hereof are not strictly applicable, or, if applicable, would not operate to protect Lender from dilution or if any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then Borrower’s board of directors shall in good faith determine and implement an appropriate adjustment in the Lender Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of Lender, provided that no such adjustment pursuant to this Section 7.3 will increase the Lender Conversion Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 7, provided further that if Lender does not accept such adjustments as appropriately protecting its interests hereunder against such dilution, then Borrower’s board of directors and Lender shall agree, in good faith, upon an independent investment bank of nationally recognized standing to make such appropriate adjustments, whose determination shall be final and binding and whose fees and expenses shall be borne by Borrower.

8. Borrower Redemptions .

8.1.

Redemption Conversion Price . Subject to the adjustments set forth herein, the conversion price for each Redemption Conversion (the “ Redemption Conversion Price ”) shall be the lesser of (a) the Lender Conversion Price, and (b) the Market Price.

8.2.

Redemptions . Beginning on the date that is sixty (60) days from the Purchase Price Date (“ Redemption Start Date ”), Lender shall have the right, exercisable at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, to redeem all or any portion of the Note (such amount, the “ Redemption Amount ”), subject to the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount, by providing Borrower with a notice substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (each, a “ Redemption Notice ”, and each date on which Lender delivers a Redemption Notice, a “ Redemption Date ”). For the avoidance of doubt, Lender may submit to Borrower one (1) or more Redemption Notices in any given calendar month; provided that the aggregate Redemption Amounts in such calendar month do not exceed the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount. Payments of each Redemption Amount may be made (a) in cash, or (b) by converting such Redemption Amount into Class A Ordinary Shares (“ Redemption Conversion Shares ”, and together with the Lender Conversion Shares, the “ Conversion Shares ”) in accordance with this Section 8.2 (each, a “ Redemption Conversion ”) per the following formula: the number of Redemption Conversion Shares equals the portion of the applicable Redemption Amount being converted divided by the Redemption Conversion Price, or (c) by any combination of the foregoing, so long as the cash is delivered to Lender on the third (3 rd ) Trading Day immediately following the applicable Redemption Date and the Redemption Conversion Shares are delivered to Lender on or before the applicable Delivery Date (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower will not be entitled to elect a Redemption Conversion with respect to any portion of any applicable Redemption Amount and shall be required to pay the Redemption Amount in cash, if on the applicable Redemption Date there is an Equity Conditions Failure, and such failure is not waived in writing by Lender. Notwithstanding that failure to repay this Note in full by the Maturity Date is a Trigger Event, the Redemption Dates shall continue after the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section 8.2 until the Outstanding Balance is repaid in full. At the end of each month following the Redemption Start Date, if Borrower has not reduced the Outstanding Balance by at least the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount, then by the fifth (5 th ) day of the following month, Borrower must pay in cash the difference between the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount and the amount actually redeemed in such month or the Outstanding Balance will automatically increase by one percent (1%). In the event Borrower is contractually restricted from issuing Redemption Conversion Shares to Lender, Borrower shall have the right to defer all redemption payments that Lender could otherwise elect to make during any calendar month on three (3) separate occasions by providing written notice to Lender at least three (3) Trading Days prior to the first day of each such calendar month for which it wishes to defer redemptions for that month. In the event Borrower elects to exercise its deferral right, the Outstanding Balance shall automatically be increased by one percent (1%) for each time Borrower exercises the deferral right.

8.3.

Allocation of Redemption Amounts . Following its receipt of a Redemption Notice, Borrower may either ratify Lender’s proposed allocation in the applicable Redemption Notice or elect to change the allocation by written notice to Lender by email or fax within twenty-four (24) hours of its receipt of such Redemption Notice, so long as the sum of the cash payments and the amount of Redemption Conversions equal the applicable Redemption Amount. If Borrower fails to notify Lender of its election to change the allocation prior to the deadline set forth in the previous sentence, it shall be deemed to have ratified and accepted the allocation set forth in the applicable Redemption Notice prepared by Lender. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the amounts and calculations set forth thereon are subject to correction or adjustment because of error, mistake, or any adjustment resulting from a Trigger Event or other adjustment permitted under the Transaction Documents (an “ Adjustment ”). Furthermore, no error or mistake in the preparation of such notices, or failure to apply any Adjustment that could have been applied prior to the preparation of a Redemption Notice may be deemed a waiver of Lender’s right to enforce the terms of any Note, even if such error, mistake, or failure to include an Adjustment arises from Lender’s own calculation. Borrower shall deliver the Redemption Conversion Shares from any Redemption Conversion to Lender in accordance with Section 9 below on or before each applicable Delivery Date.

| --- | --- | --- |
[[/TABLE]]

9. Method of Conversion Share Delivery . On or before the close of business on the third (3 rd ) Trading Day following each Redemption Date or the third (3 rd ) Trading Day following the date of delivery of a Lender Conversion Notice, as applicable (the “ Delivery Date ”), Borrower shall, provided it is DWAC Eligible at such time and such Conversion Shares are eligible for delivery via DWAC, deliver or cause its transfer agent to deliver the applicable Conversion Shares electronically via DWAC to the account designated by Lender in the applicable Lender Conversion Notice or Redemption Notice. If Borrower is not DWAC Eligible or such Conversion Shares are not eligible for delivery via DWAC, it shall deliver to Lender or its broker (as designated in the Lender Conversion Notice or Redemption Notice), via reputable overnight courier, a certificate representing the number of Class A Ordinary Shares equal to the number of Conversion Shares to which Lender shall be entitled, registered in the name of Lender or its designee. For the avoidance of doubt, Borrower has not met its obligation to deliver Conversion Shares by the Delivery Date unless Lender or its broker, as applicable, has actually received the certificate representing the applicable Conversion Shares no later than the close of business on the relevant Delivery Date pursuant to the terms set forth above.

10. Conversion Delays . If Borrower fails to deliver Conversion Shares in accordance with the timeframe stated in Section 9, Lender may at any time prior to receiving the applicable Conversion Shares rescind in whole or in part such Conversion, with a corresponding increase to the Outstanding Balance (any returned amount will tack back to the Purchase Price Date for purposes of determining the holding period under Rule 144). In addition, for each Conversion, in the event that Conversion Shares are not delivered by the Delivery Date, a late fee equal to 2% of the applicable Conversion Share Value rounded to the nearest multiple of $100.00 but with a floor of $500.00 per day (but in any event the cumulative amount of such late fees for each Conversion shall not exceed 150% of the applicable Conversion Share Value) will be assessed for each day after the Delivery Date until Conversion Share delivery is made; and such late fees will be added to the Outstanding Balance (such fees, the “ Conversion Delay Late Fees ”).

11. Ownership Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or the other Transaction Documents, Borrower shall not effect any conversion of this Note to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion would cause Lender (together with its affiliates) to beneficially own a number of shares exceeding 4.99% of the number of Class A Ordinary Shares outstanding on such date (including for such purpose the Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon such issuance) (the “ Maximum Percentage ”). For purposes of this section, beneficial ownership of Class A Ordinary Shares will be determined pursuant to Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the term “4.99%” above shall be replaced with “9.99%” at such time as the Market Capitalization is less than $10,000,000.00. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, if the term “4.99%” is replaced with “9.99%” pursuant to the preceding sentence, such increase to “9.99%” shall remain at 9.99% until increased, decreased or waived by Lender as set forth below. By written notice to Borrower, Lender may increase, decrease or waive the Maximum Percentage as to itself but any such waiver will not be effective until the 61 st day after delivery thereof. The foregoing 61-day notice requirement is enforceable, unconditional and non-waivable and shall apply to all affiliates and assigns of Lender.

12. Opinion of Counsel . In the event that an opinion of counsel is needed for any matter related to this Note, Lender has the right to have any such opinion provided by its counsel.

[[/TABLE]]

13. Governing Law; Venue . This Note shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and all questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and performance of this Note shall be governed by, the internal laws of the State of Utah, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Utah or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Utah. The provisions set forth in the Purchase Agreement to determine the proper venue for any disputes are incorporated herein by this reference.

14. Arbitration of Disputes . By its issuance or acceptance of this Note, each party agrees to be bound by the Arbitration Provisions (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) set forth as an exhibit to the Purchase Agreement.

15. Cancellation . After repayment or conversion of the entire Outstanding Balance, this Note shall be deemed paid in full, shall automatically be deemed canceled, and shall not be reissued.

16. Amendments . The prior written consent of both parties hereto shall be required for any change or amendment to this Note.

17. Assignments . Borrower may not assign this Note without the prior written consent of Lender. This Note and any Class A Ordinary Shares issued upon conversion of this Note may be offered, sold, assigned or transferred by Lender without the consent of Borrower.

18. Notices . Whenever notice is required to be given under this Note, unless otherwise provided herein, such notice shall be given in accordance with the subsection of the Purchase Agreement titled “Notices.”

19. Liquidated Damages . Lender and Borrower agree that in the event Borrower fails to comply with any of the terms or provisions of this Note, Lender’s damages would be uncertain and difficult (if not impossible) to accurately estimate because of the parties’ inability to predict future interest rates, future share prices, future trading volumes and other relevant factors. Accordingly, Lender and Borrower agree that any fees, balance adjustments, Default Interest or other charges assessed under this Note are not penalties but instead are intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, liquidated damages (under Lender’s and Borrower’s expectations that any such liquidated damages will tack back to the Purchase Price Date for purposes of determining the holding period under Rule 144).

20. Severability . If any part of this Note is construed to be in violation of any law, such part shall be modified to achieve the objective of Borrower and Lender to the fullest extent permitted by law and the balance of this Note shall remain in full force and effect.
