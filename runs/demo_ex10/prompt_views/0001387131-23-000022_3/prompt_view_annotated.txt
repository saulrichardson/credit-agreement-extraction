[[A0081]]
If the Company at any time, or from time to time, combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased.

immediately after the close of business on the day that the Common Stock trades ex-distribution, the Conversion Price then in effect shall
be reduced to an amount equal to the product of (i) the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such dividend or distribution
and (ii) the quotient determined by dividing (A) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the day that the Common Stock trades ex-distribution
by (B) the sum of (1) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the day that the Common Stock trades ex-distribution plus (2) the
amount per share of such dividend or distribution.

[[A0085]]
The Company shall not be required to give effect to any adjustment in the Conversion
Price pursuant to this Section 6(c) unless and until the net effect of one or more adjustments (each of which shall be carried forward
until counted toward an adjustment), determined in accordance with this Section 6(c), shall have resulted in a change of the Conversion
Price by at least 1%, and when the cumulative net effect of more than one adjustment so determined shall be to change the Conversion Price
by at least 1%, such change in the Conversion Price shall then be given effect.

[[A0086]]
- Adjustment of Conversion Rate upon Distributions of Capital Stock, Indebtedness or Other Non-Cash Assets .

[[A0087]]

[[A0091]]
- Notice of Adjustment . Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to this Section 6, the Company shall promptly mail notice of such adjustment to the Holder, which notice shall set forth the Conversion Price after adjustment, the date on which such adjustment became effective and a brief statement of the facts resulting in such adjustment.

[[A0096]]
- Insufficient Authorized Shares . If at any time while this Note remains outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve the Required Reserve Amount (an “ Authorized Share Failure ”), then the Company shall take all action necessary to increase the Company’s authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount.
