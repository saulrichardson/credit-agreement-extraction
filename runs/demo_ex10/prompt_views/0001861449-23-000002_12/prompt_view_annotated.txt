[[A0186]]

SECTION 5.02.

[[A0192]]
Adjusted Term SOFR.

[[A0193]]
In any such event, the affected Lender shall give the Borrower and the Administrative Agent notice of such a determination and adjustment and the Administrative Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and, upon its receipt of the notice from the affected Lender, the Borrower may, by notice to such affected Lender (I) require such Lender to furnish to the Borrower a statement setting forth the basis for adjusting Adjusted Term SOFR and the method for determining the amount of such adjustment, or (II) repay the Loans bearing interest based upon the Adjusted Term SOFR with respect to which such adjustment is made. (b) In the event that any change in market conditions or any law, regulation, treaty, or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation of application thereof, shall at any time after the date hereof, in the reasonable opinion of any Lender, make it unlawful or impractical for such Lender to maintain Loans bearing interest based upon Adjusted Term SOFR or to continue such maintaining, or to determine or charge interest rates at Adjusted Term SOFR, such Lender shall give notice of such changed circumstances to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender, (i) in the case of the pro rata share of the Loans held by such Lender and then outstanding, the date specified in such Lender’s notice shall be deemed to be the last day of the Interest Period of such portion of the Loans, and interest upon such portion thereafter shall accrue interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, and (ii) such portion of the Loans shall continue to accrue interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin until such Lender determines that it would no longer be unlawful or impractical to maintain such Loans at Adjusted Term SOFR. (c) Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender is required actually to acquire eurodollar deposits to fund or otherwise match fund any Obligation as to which interest accrues based on Adjusted Term SOFR. (d) In connection with any replacement of Term SOFR as contemplated in the definition thereof, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Term SOFR Replacement Conforming Changes and amendments implementing such Term SOFR Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.

[[A0194]]
The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Credit Parties and the Lenders of (i) replacement of Term SOFR as contemplated in the definition thereof and (ii) the effectiveness of any Term SOFR Replacement Conforming Changes.

[[A0195]]
Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent in connection with any replacement of Term SOFR, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 5.02.

[[A0196]]
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent will cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate any modification to this Agreement or the credit extensions made connection therewith (as contemplated 26 US-DOCS\137537506.9 by this Section 5.02) in a manner that does not result in a deemed exchange of such credit extensions under Section 1001 of the Code.

Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Taxes.

[[A0199]]
All payments of principal and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law.

[[A0200]]
If any Applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the applicable withholding agent, then the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law and if any such withholding or deduction is in respect of any Indemnified Taxes, then the Borrower shall pay such additional amount or amounts as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Administrative Agent (for amounts received for its own account) and each Lender will equal the full amount the Administrative Agent and such Lender would have received had no such withholding or deduction of Indemnified Taxes been required (including, without limitation, such withholdings and deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.03). After payment of any Tax by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 5.03, the Borrower shall promptly forward to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of an official receipt, a copy of the return reporting such payment, or other documentation satisfactory to the Administrative Agent evidencing such payment to such authority.

[[A0203]]
A certificate in reasonable detail as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (d) Status of Lenders.

[[A0204]]
Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments made under any Transaction Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.

[[A0205]]
In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.

[[A0206]]
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections 5.03(d)(i), 5.03(d)(ii) and 5.03(f) below) shall not be required if in such Lender’s reasonable judgment such

[[A0207]]
27 US-DOCS\137537506.9 completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

[[A0208]]
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

[[A0209]]
In addition, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, such forms shall be delivered by each Foreign Lender upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign Lender.

[[A0210]]
Each Foreign Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). 28 US-DOCS\137537506.9 (ii) Each Lender that is a "United States person" (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is a party hereto on the Closing Date or purports to become an assignee of an interest pursuant to Section 14.03 after the Closing Date (unless such Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment) shall provide to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), a properly completed and executed IRS Form W- 9 or any successor form certifying as to such Lender's entitlement to an exemption from U.S. backup withholding and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, other applicable forms, certificates or documents prescribed by the IRS or reasonably requested by the Borrower or Administrative Agent.

[[A0211]]
Each such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it determines that any certificate previously delivered to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. governmental authorities for such purposes) is no longer valid. (iii) Any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. Federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower or Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. (iv) The Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower , on or prior to the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement, a duly completed IRS Form W-8, with the effect that the Borrower may make payments to the Administrative Agent, to the extent such payments are received by the Administrative Agent as an intermediary, without deduction or withholding of any Taxes imposed by the United States (and the Administrative Agent will serve as a U.S. withholding agent (and complete associated reporting responsibilities) with respect to Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 withholding on amounts paid to the Administrative Agent in respect of the Loans (or any other amounts payable hereunder). (e) Treatment of Certain Refunds.

[[A0212]]
If any Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund in respect of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 5.3 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 5.3), then it shall promptly pay an amount equal to such refund to the Borrower, net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or of the Administrative Agent with respect thereto, including any Taxes; provided, however, that the Borrower, upon the written request of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, agrees to repay any amount paid over to the Borrower to such Lender or to the Administrative Agent (plus any related penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such Lender or the Administrative Agent is required, for any reason, to disgorge or otherwise repay such refund.

[[A0213]]
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.3, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 5.3(e) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise

[[A0214]]
29 US-DOCS\137537506.9 imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.

[[A0215]]
This Section 5.3 shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. (f) Documentation Required by FATCA.

[[A0216]]
If a payment made to a Lender under any Transaction Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

[[A0432]]
If the Administrative Agent elects to advance the applicable Loan to the Borrower in such manner, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive all interest that accrues on the date of any such Credit Extension on each Lender’s Loan Commitment Percentage of the applicable Loan unless the Administrative Agent receives such Lender’s Loan Commitment Percentage of the applicable Loan before 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the date of any such Credit Extension.

SECTION 11.15.

[[A0438]]
Return of Payments. (a) If the Administrative Agent pays an amount to a Lender under this Agreement in the belief or expectation that a related payment has been or will be received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower and such related payment is not received by the Administrative Agent, then the Administrative Agent will be entitled to recover such amount from such Lender on demand without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind, together with interest accruing on a daily basis at the Federal Funds Rate.

[[A0439]]
In addition, each Lender will repay to the Administrative Agent on demand any portion of such amount that the Administrative Agent has distributed to such Lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as the Administrative Agent is required to pay to the Borrower or such other Person, without setoff, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.

SECTION 11.16.

[[A0441]]
Sharing of Payments.

[[A0442]]
If any Lender shall obtain any payment or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application of setoff or otherwise) on account of the Loans (other than pursuant to the terms of Section 5.03(e)) in excess of its pro rata share of the total funded Loans hereunder of payments entitled pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 11.16, such Lender shall purchase from the other Lenders such participations in extensions of credit made by such other Lenders (without recourse, representation or warranty) as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment or other recovery ratably with each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter required to be returned or otherwise recovered from such purchasing Lender, such portion of such purchase shall be rescinded and each Lender which has sold a participation to the purchasing Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the ratable extent of such return or recovery, without interest.

[[A0443]]
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 11.16 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including pursuant to Section 14.16) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation). If under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 11.16 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders entitled under this Section 11.16 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

(b) [Reserved]. (c) If for any reason the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to any Borrower Indemnified Party or insufficient to hold it harmless, then the Borrower shall contribute to such Borrower Indemnified Party the amount paid or payable by such Borrower Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative economic interests of the Borrower and its Affiliates on the one hand and such Borrower Indemnified Party on the other hand in the matters contemplated by this Agreement as well as the relative fault of the Borrower and its Affiliates and such Borrower Indemnified Party with respect to such loss, claim, damage or liability and any other relevant equitable considerations.
