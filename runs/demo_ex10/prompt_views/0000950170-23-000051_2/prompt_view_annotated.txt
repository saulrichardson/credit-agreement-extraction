[[A0155]]
Further, either Executive or Employer, in a court of competent jurisdiction, may seek to compel arbitration under this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to obtain preliminary injunctive and/or other equitable relief in support of claims to be prosecuted in an arbitration to the extent allowed by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.8.

[[A0161]]
Either party shall have the right to appeal any adverse rulings or judgments to the JAMS Panel of Retired Appellate Court Justices.

[[A0162]]

[[A0163]]
The parties agree that the arbitrator shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning and that the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a California state court of competent jurisdiction for any such error.

[[A0164]]

[[A0175]]
BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING OR PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AND THEY MAY NOT BRING OR PURSUE CLAIMS OR ACT AS A PLAINTIFF, CLASS MEMBER, OR REPRESENTATIVE IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING, SUBJECT TO AND CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE LAW.

I represent that I have no rights in any Company-Related Innovations other than those Prior Innovations listed in Exhibit A (Prior Innovations). If nothing is listed on Exhibit A (Prior Innovations), I represent that there are no Prior Innovations at the time of signing this Agreement.

[[A0243]]
I hereby grant to Company and Company’s designees a royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid-up license (with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees) to fully use, practice and exploit all patent, copyright, moral right, mask work, trade secret and other intellectual property rights relating to any Prior Innovations that I incorporate, or permit to be incorporated, in any Innovations that I, solely or jointly with others, create, derive, conceive, develop, make or reduce to practice within the scope of my employment with Company (the “Company Innovations”).

[[A0250]]

[[A0251]]
Company will receive that information in confidence.

Notice of Nonassignable Innovations to Employees in California . This Agreement does not apply to an Innovation that qualifies fully as a non-assignable invention under the provisions of Section 2870 of the California Labor Code.

[[A0253]]

[[A0256]]
If Company is unable for any reason to secure my signature to any document required to file, prosecute, register or memorialize the assignment of any rights or application or to enforce any right under any Company Innovations as provided under this Agreement, I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint Company and Company’s duly authorized officers and agents as my agents and attorneys‑in‑fact to act for and on my behalf and instead of me to take all lawfully permitted acts to further the filing, prosecution, registration, memorialization of assignment, issuance, and enforcement of rights under the Innovations, all with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me.

[[A0259]]
I will provide Company with a written certification of my compliance with my obligations under this Section.

[[A0260]]

[[A0263]]
No Disparagement . During my employment with Company and after the termination thereof, I will not disparage Company, its products, services, agents or employees.

[[A0264]]
Injunctive Relief . I agree that if I violate this Agreement, Company will suffer irreparable and continuing damage for which money damages are insufficient, and Company is entitled to injunctive relief, a decree for specific performance, and all other relief as may be proper (including money damages if appropriate), to the extent permitted by law, without the need to post a bond.

[[A0265]]

[[A0266]]
Notices to me shall be sent to any address in Company’s records or other address as I may provide in writing.

[[A0267]]
Notices to Company shall be sent to Company’s Human Resources Department or to another address as Company may specify in writing.

[[A0268]]
Governing Law; Forum . The laws of the United States of America and the State of California govern all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.

[[A0269]]

[[A0270]]
Additionally, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to

[[A0271]]
12

[[A0272]]
the contrary, a claim for equitable relief arising out of or related to this Agreement may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.

[[A0273]]
For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing terms will control over any conflicting terms in my offer letter.

[[A0274]]
Severability . If an arbitrator or court of law holds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) that provision shall be deemed amended to provide Company the maximum protection permitted by applicable law and (b) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected.

[[A0275]]
Waiver; Modification . If Company waives any term, provision or breach by me of this Agreement, such waiver shall not be effective unless it is in writing and signed by Company.
