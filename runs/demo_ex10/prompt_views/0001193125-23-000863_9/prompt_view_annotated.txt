Company has entered into an agreement with [•] (the “

[[A0113]]
The
Company shall notify you at least
seventy-two
- hours in advance (or such shorter time as you may agree) of the actual date of the consummation of the Business Combination (the “
Consummation
Date
”). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Trust Agreement.

[[A0114]]
In
accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement, we hereby authorize you to commence to liquidate all of the assets of the Trust Account and to transfer the proceeds into a segregated account held by you on behalf of the Beneficiaries to the effect
that, on the Consummation Date, all of the funds held in the Trust Account will be immediately available for transfer to the account or accounts that the Company shall direct on the Consummation Date.

[[A0115]]
It is acknowledged and agreed that while the
funds are on deposit in the trust operating account at Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC awaiting distribution, the Company will earn no interest or dividends.

[[A0116]]
On the Consummation Date (i) counsel for the Company shall deliver to you written notification that the Business Combination has been consummated, or will be consummated substantially, concurrently with your transfer of funds to the accounts as directed by the Company (the “ Notification ”) and (ii) the Company shall deliver to you (a) a certificate of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company, which verifies that the Business Combination has been approved by a vote of the Company’s shareholders, if a vote is held and (b) joint written instruction signed by the Company and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., with respect to the transfer of the funds held in the Trust Account (the “ Instruction Letter ”). You are hereby directed and authorized to transfer the funds held in the Trust Account immediately upon your receipt of the Notification and the Instruction Letter, in accordance with the terms of the Instruction Letter.

[[A0117]]
In the event that certain deposits held in the Trust Account may not be liquidated by the Consummation Date without penalty, you will notify the Company in writing of the same and the Company shall direct you as to whether such funds should remain in the Trust Account and be distributed after the Consummation Date to the Company.

[[A0118]]
Upon the distribution of all the funds, net of any payments necessary for reasonable unreimbursed expenses related to liquidating the Trust Account, your obligations under the Trust Agreement shall be terminated.

[[A0119]]
