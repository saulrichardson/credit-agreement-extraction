Guaranteed payments shall be paid to Executive every month in 14565347 equal installments without deductions and withholdings. This guaranteed payment shall be periodically reviewed by the Board of Managers of Stansberry Research or the Board of Directors of Holdings, as the case may be (the “ Board ”) and adjusted upward or downward by the Board as the Board deems appropriate; provided that any adjustment downward shall only be permitted if the same adjustment is being made to all other similarly situated executives of Stansberry Research and/or Holdings.

Such discretionary bonuses will be at the sole discretion of the Board and paid to Executive in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board.
