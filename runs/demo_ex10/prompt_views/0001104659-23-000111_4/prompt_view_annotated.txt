AGREEMENT

[[A0012]]
1. Company Stockholder Written Consent and Related Matters .

[[A0013]]
- As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following the time at which the Registration Statement / Proxy Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, the Stockholders shall duly execute and deliver to the Company and Parent the Written Consent, under which they shall irrevocably and unconditionally consent to, authorize and approve the Merger Agreement and the Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.

[[A0014]]
Without limiting the generality of the first sentence of this Section 1(a) , prior to the Closing, the Company Stockholders shall vote (or cause to be voted) the Subject Company Shares against and withhold consent with respect to (A) any Company Acquisition Proposal or (B) any other matter, action or proposal that would reasonably be expected to (x) impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify any provision of this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, any Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated thereby, (y) result in a breach of any of the Company’s covenants, agreements or obligations under the Merger Agreement, or (z) any of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Sections 8.1 or 8.2 of the Merger Agreement not being satisfied.

[[A0015]]
- Without limiting any other rights or remedies of Parent, each Company Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints Parent or any individual reasonably designated by Parent as such Company Stockholder’s agent, attorney-in-fact and proxy (with full power of substitution and resubstituting), for and in the name, place and stead of such Company Stockholder, to attend on behalf of such Company Stockholder any meeting of the Company Stockholders with respect to the matters described in Section 1(a) , to include such Company Stockholder’s Subject Company Shares in any computation for purposes of establishing a quorum at any such meeting of the Company Stockholders, to vote (or cause to be voted) such Stockholder’s Subject Company Shares or consent (or withhold consent) with respect to any of the matters described in Section 1(a) in connection with any meeting of the Company Stockholders or any action by written consent by the Company Stockholders (including the Company Stockholder Written Consent), in each case, in the event that such Company Stockholder fails to perform or otherwise comply with the covenants, agreements or obligations set forth in Section 1(a) .

[[A0016]]
- The proxy granted by each Company Stockholder pursuant to Section 1(b) is coupled with an interest sufficient at law to support an irrevocable proxy and is granted in consideration for Parent entering into the Merger Agreement and agreeing to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

[[A0017]]
The proxy granted by each Company Stockholder pursuant to Section 1(b) is also a durable proxy and shall survive the bankruptcy, dissolution, death, incapacity or other inability to act by such Company Stockholder and shall revoke any and all prior proxies granted by such Company Stockholder with respect to its Subject Company Shares.

[[A0018]]
The vote or consent of the proxyholder in accordance with Section 1(b) and with respect to the matters in Section 1(a) shall control in the event of any conflict between such vote or consent by the proxyholder of the Subject Company Shares and a vote or consent by a Company Stockholder of the Subject Company Shares (or any other Person with the power to vote the Subject Company Shares) with respect to the matters in Section 1(a) . The proxyholder may not exercise the proxy granted pursuant to Section 1(b) on any matter except those provided in Section 1(a) .
