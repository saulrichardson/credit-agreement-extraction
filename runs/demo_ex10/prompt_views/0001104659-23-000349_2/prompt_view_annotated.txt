[[A0003]]
This Resignation from Employment Agreement (this “ Agreement ”) is entered into by and between ProPetro Services Inc., a Texas corporation (the “ Company ”), and Newton W.

[[A0004]]
Wilson III (“ Wilson ”). ProPetro Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation and parent of the Company (the “ Parent ”), enters into this Agreement for the limited purpose of acknowledging and agreeing to the provisions set forth in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) and Section 6. Wilson and the Company are sometimes referred to herein individually as a “ Party ” and collectively as the “ Parties .”

[[A0005]]
WHEREAS, Wilson has resigned from his position as the Company’s and Parent’s General Counsel and Corporate Secretary and an employee of the Company effective as of December 31, 2022 (the “ Separation Date ”);

[[A0006]]
WHEREAS, the Parties wish to amend equity awards granted to Wilson in connection with his termination of employment so that he may have the opportunity to receive settlement of or earn, as the case may be, such awards as set forth in this Agreement, which amendments are conditioned upon Wilson’s timely execution of and compliance with the terms of this Agreement; and

[[A0007]]
WHEREAS, the Parties wish to resolve any and all claims or causes of action that the Parties have or may have against each other, including any claims or causes of action that Wilson may have arising out of Wilson’s employment or end of such employment.

[[A0008]]
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and benefits set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by Wilson and the Company, the Parties agree as follows:

[[A0009]]
1.

[[A0010]]
Resignations;
Separation Date
.

[[A0011]]
The Parties acknowledge and agree that as of the Separation Date, Wilson has resigned from employment with the
Company, and, to the extent applicable, has also resigned (i) as General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the Company and Parent,
- as an officer of the Parent, the Company and each of their respective Affiliates (as defined below) for which Wilson served
as an officer and (iii) from the board of directors or board of managers (or similar governing body) of any corporation, limited
liability entity, unlimited liability entity, or other entity in which the Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates holds
an equity interest and with respect to which board of directors or board of managers (or similar governing body) Wilson served as the
Parent’s, Company’s or such other subsidiary’s member’s designee or other representative.

[[A0012]]
2. Separation Payment . Provided that Wilson: (x) executes this Agreement on or after the Separation Date and returns a signed copy of it to the Company, care of John J. Mitchell, ProPetro Holding Corp., 1706 S. Midkiff, Bldg.

[[A0013]]
B, Midland, Texas 79701 (e-mail: jody.mitchell@propetroservices.com), so that it is received no later than the close of business on the date that is twenty-one (21) days after Wilson receives this Agreement, and it is not subsequently revoked by Wilson in accordance with Section 5; and (y) satisfies the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Wilson shall receive the following consideration:

[[A0014]]
- For the avoidance of doubt, Wilson shall remain eligible to receive an annual bonus under the Amended and Restated ProPetro Holding Corp.

[[A0015]]
Executive Incentive Bonus Plan (the “ Bonus Plan ”) for the 2022 calendar year (the “ 2022 Bonus ”). The amount of the 2022 Bonus shall be the full amount of any annual bonus under the Bonus Plan that the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Parent (the “ Committee ”) determines that Wilson has earned for the 2022 calendar year, which shall be determined based on the Parent’s and Wilson’s achievement of the applicable performance metrics during the 2022 calendar year, as certified by the Committee, and which shall be paid, if at all, at such time that the annual bonuses are paid to other similarly situated participants in the Bonus Plan (such date to occur no later than March 15, 2023);

[[A0016]]
- All restricted stock units granted on February 11, 2020 to Wilson under the ProPetro Holding Corp.

[[A0017]]
2017 Incentive Award Plan (the “ 2017 Plan ”) and on February 17, 2021 and February 16, 2022 to Wilson under the ProPetro Holding Corp. 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan (the “ 2020 Plan ”) and, in each case, outstanding as of the Separation Date (the “ RSUs ”) will be deemed to be amended immediately prior to the Separation Date to provide that such awards shall vest on the Separation Date and shall be settled following the date that this Agreement becomes irrevocable but no later than thirty days following the Separation Date; and

[[A0018]]
- All performance share units granted on each of February 17, 2021 and February 16, 2022 to Wilson under the 2020 Plan and, in each case, outstanding as of the Separation Date (the “ PSUs ”) will be deemed to be amended immediately prior to the Separation Date to provide (i) that the service requirement associated with such awards will be deemed to be fulfilled as of the Separation Date; provided, however, that the PSUs will remain outstanding and the number of PSUs that actually vest (i.e., between 0% and 200% of such target number) will be determined based on the Parent’s actual performance as compared to the performance metrics outlined in the applicable award agreement over the relevant performance period and such vested PSUs, if any, shall be settled at the time originally specified in the applicable award agreement.

[[A0019]]
For the avoidance of doubt, the vesting and timing of settlement with respect to the PSUs would not be impacted by the death of Wilson following the Separation Date.

[[A0020]]
Wilson acknowledges and agrees that the consideration described in this Section 2 represents the entirety of the amounts Wilson is eligible to receive as severance pay from the Company, the Parent or any other Company Party, including under the 2017 Plan, the 2020 Plan, the Bonus Plan, and the ProPetro Services, Inc. Second Amended and Restated Executive Severance Plan.

[[A0021]]
Wilson acknowledges that he is aware of the ongoing obligations he will have under the Parent’s Insider Trading Policy, applicable securities laws and any other applicable requirements related to any trading in the Parent’s securities.

into this Agreement, Wilson hereby releases, discharges and forever acquits the Company, Parent, and their respective Affiliates (as defined
below) and subsidiaries, and each of the foregoing entities’ respective past, present and future members, partners (including general
partners and limited partners), directors, trustees, officers, managers, employees, agents, attorneys, heirs, legal representatives, insurers,
benefit plans (and their fiduciaries, administrators and trustees), and the successors and assigns of the foregoing, in their personal
and representative capacities (collectively, the “
Company Parties
”), from liability for, and hereby waives,
any and all claims, damages, or causes of action of any kind related to Wilson’ ownership of any interest in any Company Party,
Wilson’s employment with any Company Party, the termination of such employment, and any other acts or omissions related to any matter
occurring on or prior to the date that Wilson executes this Agreement, including (i) any alleged violation through such date of:
- any federal, state or local anti-discrimination law or anti-retaliation law, regulation or ordinance including Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Sections 1981 through 1988 of Title 42 of the United States Code,
as amended and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended; (B) the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended; (C) the Immigration Reform Control Act, as amended; (D) the National Labor Relations Act, as amended; (E) the

and Restated Executive Severance Plan; and (iv) any claim for compensation or benefits of any kind not expressly set forth in this
Agreement (collectively, the “
Released Claims
”). This Agreement is not intended to indicate that any such claims
exist or that, if they do exist, they are meritorious.

Rather, Wilson is simply agreeing that, in exchange for any consideration received
by him pursuant to Section 2, any and all potential claims of this nature that Wilson may have against the Company Parties, regardless
of whether they actually exist, are expressly settled, compromised and waived.

[[A0027]]

officers’ liability insurance coverage that Wilson has under Delaware law, the charter, bylaws, other organizational documents and
insurance policies of any Company Party or any agreement with any Company Party; and (II) any rights to enforce the terms of this
Agreement, including those in Section 2 of this Agreement related to incentive compensation and equity.

[[A0033]]
Further, nothing in this Agreement prohibits or restricts Wilson from filing a charge or complaint with, or cooperating in any investigation with, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or any other securities regulatory agency or authority (each, a “ Government Agency ”). This Agreement does not limit Wilson’s right to receive an award for information provided to a Government Agency.

[[A0034]]
Further, in no event shall the Released Claims include (i) any claim which arises after the date that this Agreement is executed by Wilson or (ii) any claim to vested benefits under an employee benefit plan.

[[A0035]]
Finally, the Released Claims shall not include the Company’s obligations or Wilson’s rights under the Indemnification Agreement dated September 25, 2019 between the Company and Wilson, which shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the execution of this Agreement.

[[A0036]]
- Wilson hereby represents and warrants that, as of the time Wilson executes this Agreement, Wilson has not brought or joined any lawsuit or filed any charge or claim against any of the Company Parties in any court or before any Government Agency or arbitrator for or with respect to a matter, claim, or incident that occurred or arose out of one or more occurrences that took place on or prior to the time at which Wilson signs this Agreement.

[[A0037]]
Wilson warrants and represents that (i) he is the sole owner of each and every claim, cause of action, and right compromised, settled, released or assigned pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement and has not previously assigned, sold, transferred, conveyed, or encumbered same; (ii) he has the full right, power, capacity, and authority to enter into and execute this Agreement; and (iii) he fully understands this Agreement releases any and all past claims regardless of whether he is now aware of such claims.

[[A0038]]

- The only matters relied upon by Wilson and causing Wilson to sign this Agreement are the provisions set forth in writing within the four corners of this Agreement; and

[[A0048]]

[[A0050]]
5. Revocation Right .

To be effective, such revocation must be in writing signed by Wilson and must be received by the Company, care of John J. Mitchell, ProPetro Holding Corp., 1706 S. Midkiff, Bldg.

[[A0051]]

[[A0054]]
In entering into this Agreement, Wilson specifically acknowledges the validity, binding effect, and enforceability of (a) Article III of the award agreements documenting the RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan, (b) Article IV of the award agreements documenting the PSUs granted under the 2017 Plan, and (c) Section 7 of the award agreement documenting the RSUs and PSUs granted under the 2020 Plan, in each case, as clarified by the following sentence.

[[A0055]]
The Parent acknowledges and agrees that the only business activities restricted by the non-competition covenants set forth in the award agreements documenting the RSUs and the PSUs are those activities relating to pressure pumping, cementing and coil tubing in the oilfield services industry (the “ Restricted Services ”). For the avoidance of doubt, Wilson’ involvement with any exploration and production company or other oilfield services company that does not provide such Restricted Services shall not constitute a violation of any continuing obligations.

[[A0060]]
Nothing herein limits the Company or any Company Party from cooperating with any investigation by any Government Agency, from making any disclosure necessary or appropriate under applicable securities laws or from making any disclosure required by applicable law or legal process.

[[A0061]]
8. No Waiver . No failure by any Party hereto at any time to give notice of any breach by any other Party of, or to require compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.
