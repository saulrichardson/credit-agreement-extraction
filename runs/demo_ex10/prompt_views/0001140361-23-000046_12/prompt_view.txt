- If any Shares subject to an Award are forfeited or expire or
such Award is settled for cash (in whole or in part), the Shares subject to such Award shall, to the extent of such forfeiture, expiration or cash settlement, again be available for future grants of Awards under the Plan. Notwithstanding anything to

grant under the Plan;
provided
that Awards using such available shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be

5.3 Option Exercise Price . The exercise price per Share subject to each Option shall be set by the Administrator, but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted (or, as to Incentive Stock Options, on the date the Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code). In addition, in the case of Incentive Stock Options granted to a Greater Than 10% Stockholder, such price shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted (or the date the Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code).

clause (a) or (b) above.

Except as limited by the requirements of Section 409A or Section 422 of the Code and regulations and rulings thereunder, the Administrator may extend the term of any outstanding Option, and may extend the time period during which vested Options may be exercised, in connection with any Termination of Service of the Holder, in each case, to the extent that such extension does not constitute a repricing or a cash buyout under Section 10.6, and may amend any other term or condition of such Option relating to such a Termination of Service.

5.5 Option Vesting .

or exchange of shares, consummation of a merger, consolidation or other distribution (other than normal cash dividends) of Company assets to stockholders, or any other change affecting the Common Stock or other securities of the Company or the share
price of the Common Stock or other securities of the Company other than an Equity Restructuring, the Administrator shall make equitable adjustments, if any, to reflect such change with respect to (i) the aggregate number and kind of shares that may
be issued under the Plan (including, but not limited to, adjustments of the limitations in Section 3.1 on the maximum number and kind of shares which may be issued under the Plan, and adjustments of the Award Limit, and adjustments of the manner in
which shares subject to Full Value Awards will be counted); (ii) the number and kind of shares of Common Stock (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards; (iii) the terms and conditions of any outstanding Awards (including,
without limitation, any applicable performance targets or criteria with respect thereto); and (iv) the grant or exercise price per share for any outstanding Awards under the Plan.

- In the event of any transaction or event described in
Section 12.2(a) or any unusual or nonrecurring transactions or events affecting the Company, any Affiliate of the Company, or the financial statements of the Company or any Affiliate, or of changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting
principles, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, and on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, either by the terms of the Award or by action taken prior to the occurrence of such transaction or event and either automatically or upon
the Holder’s request, is hereby authorized to take any one or more of the following actions whenever the Administrator determines that such action is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits
intended to be made available under the Plan or with respect to any Award under the Plan, to facilitate such transactions or events or to give effect to such changes in laws, regulations or principles:

- To provide for either (A) termination of any such Award
in exchange for an amount of cash, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Holder’s rights (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the
transaction or event described in this Section 12.2 the Administrator determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Holder’s rights, then such Award may be terminated by the
Company without payment) or (B) the replacement of such Award with other rights or property selected by the Administrator in its sole discretion having an aggregate value not exceeding the amount that could have been attained upon the exercise of
such Award or realization of the Holder’s rights had such Award been currently exercisable or payable or fully vested;

- To provide that such Award be assumed by the successor or
survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or shall be substituted for by similar options, rights or awards covering the stock of the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as
to the number and kind of shares and prices;

- To make adjustments in the number and type of shares of
the Company’s stock (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards, and in the number and kind of outstanding Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock and/or in the terms and conditions of (including the grant or exercise price), and the
criteria included in, outstanding Awards and Awards which may be granted in the future;

20

- To provide that such Award shall be exercisable or payable
or fully vested with respect to all shares covered thereby, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or the applicable Program or Award Agreement; and

- To provide that the Award cannot vest, be exercised or
become payable after such event.

- In connection with the occurrence of any Equity
Restructuring, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 12.2(a) and 12.2(b):

- The number and type of securities subject to each
outstanding Award and the exercise price or grant price thereof, if applicable, shall be equitably adjusted; and/or

- The Administrator shall make such equitable adjustments,
if any, as the Administrator in its discretion may deem appropriate to reflect such Equity Restructuring with respect to the aggregate number and kind of shares that may be issued under the Plan (including, but not limited to, adjustments of the
limitations in Section 3.1 on the maximum number and kind of shares which may be issued under the Plan, and adjustments of the Award Limit, and adjustments of the manner in which shares subject to Full Value Awards will be counted). The adjustments
provided under this Section 12.2(c) shall be nondiscretionary and shall be final and binding on the affected Holder and the Company.

- In the event an Award is assumed or an equivalent Award
substituted in connection with a Change in Control, and a Holder has a Termination of Service by the Company without “cause” (as such term is defined in the sole discretion of the Administrator, or as set forth in a written agreement relating to such
Award between the Company (or an Affiliate) and the Holder) upon or within twelve (12) months following the Change in Control, then such Holder shall be fully vested in such assumed or substituted Award.

- In the event that the successor corporation in a Change in
Control refuses to assume or substitute for the Award, the Administrator shall cause any or all of such Awards to become fully exercisable immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction and all forfeiture restrictions on any or all of such
Awards to lapse, provided that, to the extent that the vesting of any such Award is subject to the satisfaction of specified performance goals, such Award shall vest at either (as the Administrator may determine) (i) the target level of performance,
pro-rated based on the period elapsed between the beginning of the applicable performance period and the date of the Change in Control, or (ii) the actual performance level as of the date of the Change in Control (as determined by the Administrator)
with respect to all open performance period. If an Award is exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a Change in Control, the Administrator shall notify the Holder that the Award shall be fully exercisable for a period of
fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, contingent upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, and the Award shall terminate upon the expiration of such period.

- For purposes of this Section 12.2, an Award shall be
considered assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each share of Common Stock subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or
other securities or property) received in the Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares);
provided
,
however
, that if such consideration received in the Change in Control was not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent, the Administrator may, with the
consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Award, for each share of Common Stock subject to an Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent equal in fair
market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control.

- The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, include such
further provisions and limitations in any Award, agreement or certificate, as it may deem equitable and in the best interests of the Company that are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan.

21

- No adjustment or action described in this Section 12.2 or in
any other provision of the Plan shall be authorized to the extent that such adjustment or action would cause the Plan or an Award to violate Section 422(b)(1) of the Code or other applicable law. Furthermore, no such adjustment or action shall be
authorized to the extent such adjustment or action would result in short-swing profits liability under Section 16 or violate the exemptive conditions of Rule 16b-3 unless the Administrator determines that the Award is not to comply with such
exemptive conditions.

- The existence of the Plan, the Program, the Award Agreement
and the Awards granted hereunder shall not affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Company, its Affiliates or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the
Company’s or such Affiliate’s capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Company or any Affiliate, any issue of stock or of options, warrants or rights to purchase stock or of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior
preference stocks whose rights are superior to or affect the Common Stock or the rights thereof or which are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any Affiliate, or any sale or transfer
of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.

- In the event of any pending stock dividend, stock split,
combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or other distribution (other than normal cash dividends) of Company assets to stockholders, or any other change affecting the shares of Common Stock or the share price of the Common Stock
including any Equity Restructuring, for reasons of administrative convenience, the Company in its sole discretion may refuse to permit the exercise of any Award during a period of thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of any such transaction.

12.3 Approval of Plan by Stockholders . The Plan will be submitted for the approval of the Company’s stockholders within twelve (12) months after the date this Plan is approved by the Board.

12.5 Paperless Administration . In the event that the Company establishes, for itself or using the services of a third party, an automated system for the documentation, granting or exercise of Awards, such as a system using an internet website or interactive voice response, then the paperless documentation, granting or exercise of Awards by a Holder may be permitted through the use of such an automated system.

12.6 Effect of Plan upon Other Compensation Plans . The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other compensation or incentive plans in effect for the Company or any Affiliate. Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to limit the right of the Company or any Affiliate to (a) establish any other forms of incentives or compensation for Employees, Directors or Consultants of the Company or any Affiliate or (b) grant or assume options or other rights or awards otherwise than under the Plan in connection with any proper corporate purpose including without limitation, the grant or assumption of options in connection with the acquisition by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of the business, stock or assets of any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, firm or association.

12.7 Compliance with Laws . The Plan, the granting and vesting of Awards under the Plan and the issuance and delivery of Shares and LTIP Units and the payment of money under the Plan or under Awards granted or awarded hereunder are subject to compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to state, federal and foreign securities law and margin requirements), the rules of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares are listed, quoted or traded, and to such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be necessary or advisable in connection therewith. Any securities delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such restrictions, and the person acquiring such securities shall, if requested by the Company, provide such assurances and representations to the Company as the Company may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal requirements. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such laws, rules and regulations.

22

12.8 Titles and Headings, References to Sections of the Code or Exchange Act .

12.10 Section 409A . To the extent that the Administrator determines that any Award granted under the Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Program pursuant to which such Award is granted and the Award Agreement evidencing such Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions required by Section 409A of the Code. To the extent applicable, the Plan, the Program and any Award Agreements shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that the Administrator determines that any Award may be subject to Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance, the Administrator may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Program and Award Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the Award from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Award, or (b) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance and thereby avoid the application of any penalty taxes under such Section.

12.11 No Rights to Awards . No Eligible Individual or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award pursuant to the Plan, and none of the Company, any Affiliate or the Administrator is obligated to treat Eligible Individuals, Holders or any other persons uniformly.

12.12 Unfunded Status of Awards . The Plan is intended to be an “unfunded” plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Holder pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Program or Award Agreement shall give the Holder any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.

12.13 Indemnification . To the extent allowable pursuant to applicable law, each member of the Committee or of the Board shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in satisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her; provided , that he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled pursuant to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.

12.14 Relationship to Other Benefits . No payment pursuant to the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Affiliate except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder.

12.15 Expenses . The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

23

12.16 Claw-Back Provisions . All Awards (including any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit the Holder actually or constructively receives upon receipt or exercise of any Award or the receipt or resale of any shares of Common Stock underlying the Award) will be subject to any Company claw-back policy, including any claw-back policy adopted to comply with applicable laws (including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder) as set forth in such claw-back policy or the Award Agreement.

12.17 Grant of Awards to Certain Eligible Individuals . The Company may provide through the establishment of a formal written policy (which shall be deemed a part of this Plan) or otherwise for the method by which Common Stock or other securities of the Company may be issued and by which such Common Stock or other securities and/or payment therefor may be exchanged or contributed among such entities, or may be returned upon any forfeiture of Common Stock or other securities by the Eligible Individual.

12.18 REIT Status . The Plan shall be interpreted and construed in a manner consistent with the Company’s status as a REIT. No Award shall be granted or awarded, and with respect to any Award granted under the Plan, such Award shall not vest, be exercisable or be settled:

- to the extent that the grant, vesting, exercise or settlement of
such Award could cause the Participant or any other person to be in violation of any provision of Section 4(b) of the Company’s charter; or

- if, in the discretion of the Administrator, the grant, vesting,
exercise or settlement of such award could impair the Company’s status as a REIT.
