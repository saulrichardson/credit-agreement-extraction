- Subject to clauses (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this Section 2.8, if prior to the first day of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing or in connection with an existing or proposed RFR Loan:

- the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing, for ascertaining the Term SOFR, CDOR Rate, EURIBOR Rate or TIBOR Rate for a Loan in the applicable currency or for the applicable Interest Period or (B) for ascertaining the RFR Rate for a RFR Loan in the applicable currency (including in each case because the Relevant Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis); or

53

(ii)

the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders
(or, in the case of a Competitive Loan, the Lender that is required to make such Competitive Loan) (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term Benchmark Borrowing, that the Term SOFR Rate, CDOR Rate, EURIBOR Rate or TIBOR Rate for a
Loan in the applicable currency or for the applicable Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) (as conclusively certified by such Lenders or Lender, as the case may be) of making or maintaining their
affected Revolving Credit Loans (or its Competitive Loan) during such Interest Period or (B) that the RFR Rate for a Loan in the applicable currency will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such
Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected RFR Loans, then the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrowers and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies
the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (A) any interest election request pursuant to Section 2.4 that requests continuation of (or conversion to) any Term Benchmark Loan in the affected
currencies or for such applicable Interest Period and/or conversion of any Loan to a RFR Loan shall be ineffective, (B) if Dollars are the applicable currency described in the foregoing clause (b)(i) and a Borrowing of a Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan

Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings also is the subject of Section 2.8(b)(i) or (ii) above (without prejudicing the Borrower’s right to thereafter request a Money Market Loan), (C) if Canadian Dollars are the applicable currency described in the
foregoing clause (b)(i) and a Term Benchmark Loan is requested in Canadian Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as a Canadian Prime Rate Loan and (D) if any Alternate Currency (other than Canadian Dollars) is the applicable currency described in the
foregoing clause (b)(i) and a Borrowing of a Term Benchmark Loan is requested in any such Alternate Currency, then such request shall be ineffective;
provided
,
further
that (A) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice do not
affect all the Lenders, then requests by Kimco for Competitive Borrowings may be made to Lenders that are not affected thereby and (B) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings
shall be permitted. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan in any Agreed Currency is outstanding on the date of the Borrower’s receipt of the notice from the Administrative Agent referred to in this Section 2.8(b) with respect to a
Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) if such Term Benchmark Loan is
denominated in Dollars, (A) any Term Benchmark Loan shall on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day), be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall
constitute, (x) an RFR Borrowing denominated in Dollars so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is not also the subject of Section 2.8(b)(i) or (ii) above or (y) an ABR Loan if the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings
also is the subject of Section 2.8(b)(i) or (ii) above, on such day, and (B) any RFR Loan shall on and from such day be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute an ABR Loan, (ii) if such Term Benchmark Loan is denominated in any
Agreed Currency other than Dollars, then such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business Day if such day is not a Business Day) bear interest at (x) if denominated in Canadian Dollars,
the Canadian Prime Rate or (y) if denominated in any other Alternate Currency, the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency plus the Applicable Rate; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected Term Benchmark Loans denominated in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars shall, at the
Borrower’s election prior to such day: (A) be prepaid by the Borrower on such day or (B) solely for the purpose of calculating the interest rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan, such Term Benchmark Loan denominated in any Agreed Currency other
than Dollars shall be deemed to be a Term Benchmark Loan denominated in Dollars and shall accrue interest at the same interest rate applicable to Term Benchmark Loans denominated in Dollars at such time or (iii) if such RFR Loan is denominated in any
Agreed Currency other than Dollars, then such Loan shall bear interest at the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency plus the Applicable Rate; provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive
and binding absent manifest error) that the Central Bank Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency cannot be determined, any outstanding affected RFR Loans denominated in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, at the Borrower’s election, shall either
- be converted into ABR Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such Alternate Currency) immediately or (B) be prepaid in full immediately. The Administrative Agent shall not make a determination described in
Section 2.8(b)(i), and no Lender shall advise the Administrative Agent as described in Section 2.8(b)(ii) unless the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, is then generally making similar determinations or delivering similar advice, in
each case, under other credit facilities to which it is a party with borrowers or account parties that are similarly situated to and of similar creditworthiness to the Borrowers.

54

- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders.

- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole
discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.8.

55

- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Rate, EURIBOR Rate, TIBOR Rate or CDOR Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.

(g)

Upon Kimco’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark
Unavailability Period, (A) any interest election request pursuant to Section 2.4 that requests continuation of (or conversion to) any Term Benchmark Loan in the affected currencies or for such applicable Interest Period and/or conversion of any Loan to
a RFR Loan shall be ineffective, (B) if Dollars are the affected currency and a Borrowing of a Term Benchmark Loan is requested in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as (1) an RFR Borrowing denominated in Dollars so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple
RFR for Dollar Borrowings is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (2) an ABR Borrowing if the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event (without prejudicing the Borrower’s right to
thereafter request a Money Market Loan), (C) if Canadian Dollars are the affected currency and a Term Benchmark Loan is requested in Canadian Dollars, such Borrowing shall be made as a Canadian Prime Rate Loan, (D) if any Alternate Currency (other than
Canadian Dollars) is the affected currency and a Borrowing of a Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan is requested in any such affected Alternate Currency, then such request shall be ineffective and (E) any request by Kimco for a Competitive Loan based on
the Term Benchmark Rate shall be ineffective; provided, further that (A) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice do not affect all the Lenders, then requests by Kimco for Competitive Borrowings may be made to Lenders that are not affected
thereby and (B) if the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current
Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of ABR based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of ABR. Furthermore, if any Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan in any
Agreed Currency is outstanding on the date of the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a Relevant Rate applicable to such Term Benchmark Loan or RFR Loan, then until such time as a
Benchmark Replacement for such Agreed Currency is implemented pursuant to this Section 2.8, (i) if such Term Benchmark Loan is denominated in Dollars, then on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next succeeding Business
Day if such day is not a Business Day), such Loan shall be converted by the Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute, (x) an RFR Borrowing denominated in Dollars so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is not the subject of
a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) an ABR Loan if the Adjusted Daily Simple RFR for Dollar Borrowings is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event, on such day, (ii) any RFR Loan denominated in Dollars shall on and from such day be converted by the
Administrative Agent to, and shall constitute an ABR Loan, (iii) if such Term Benchmark Loan is denominated in any Agreed Currency other than Dollars, then such Loan shall, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable to such Loan (or the next

- be prepaid in full immediately.

56

- Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.8

or anything in any Loan Document to the contrary, any Benchmark Replacement and Benchmark Replacement Adjustment agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers and any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes shall be on terms no less favorable to the Borrowers than corresponding terms in credit facilities to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. serves as administrative agent with borrowers similarly situated to and of similar creditworthiness to the Borrowers, in general, but not necessarily all such credit facilities with respect to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. serves as administrative agent; provided, further, that nothing in this clause (g) shall obligate the Administrative Agent to disclose any information regarding other borrowers or facilities.

SECTION 2.9 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments .

- Each borrowing by any Borrower of Revolving Credit Loans using the Tranche A Commitments or the Tranche B Commitments, as applicable, each payment by any
Borrower on account of any fees hereunder and any reduction of the Tranche A Commitments or Tranche B Commitments (other than pursuant to Section 10.10(a)), as applicable, shall be made pro rata according to the respective Applicable Percentages of the
Lenders. Each payment (including each prepayment) by any Borrower on account of principal of and interest on the Tranche A Loans or Tranche B Loans, as applicable, shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of such
Borrower’s Tranche A Loans or Tranche B Loans, as applicable, then held by the Lenders in the currency in which such Revolving Credit Loan was made. If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay
fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed Letter of Credit drawings, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed Letter of Credit drawings then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of principal and unreimbursed Letter of Credit drawings then due to such parties. All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrowers hereunder and under the Notes, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise,
shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, or, if the payment is due in an Alternate Currency, local time for the principal market of such currency, on the due date thereof to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Lenders, at (x) in the case of payments due in Dollars the Administrative Agent’s office specified in Section 10.2 in immediately available funds and (y)

in the case of payments due in an Alternate Currency, to such office as the Administrative Agent may hereafter specify by notice to the Borrowers. It is understood that, if any payment of principal is made on
any day in accordance with the preceding sentence, no interest shall accrue on such day in respect of such principal. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the applicable Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If
any payment hereunder (other than payments on Term Benchmark Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest
thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If any payment on a Term Benchmark Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day
(and, with respect to any such payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension) unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event
such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.

57

- Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount
that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the
Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.9(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender’s share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by
such Lender within three (3) Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to the rate per annum applicable to such Borrowing, on
demand, from the applicable Borrower.

SECTION 2.10 Illegality .

Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any Change in Law or in the interpretation or application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, to continue Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans as such, or to convert ABR Loans to Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans shall forthwith be cancelled, (b) such Lender’s Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding as Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to ABR Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law and (c) such Lender’s Competitive Loans then outstanding as Term Benchmark Loans, if any, shall, if required by law, be converted automatically to ABR Loans. If any such conversion of a Term Benchmark Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the applicable Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.13.

58

- shall impose on such Lender any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement (other than Taxes); or

- subject any Recipient to any Taxes on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto (other than (x) Indemnified Taxes and (y) Excluded Taxes); and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, the Issuing Lender or such other Recipient, by an amount which such Lender, the Issuing Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, deems to be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Term Benchmark Loans, RFR Loans, Money Market Loans or Fixed Rate Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, (x) each Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, the Issuing Lender or such other Recipient, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender, the Issuing Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable solely with respect to such Borrower’s Loans and Letters of Credit and (y) the Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, to pay such Lender, the Issuing Lender or such other Recipient, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender, the Issuing Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable with respect to this Agreement or the Revolving Commitments generally and not solely with respect to any particular Borrower’s Loans and Letters of Credit.

- If any Lender or the Issuing Lender shall have determined that the application of any Requirement of Law or any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy or liquidity or compliance by such Lender or the Issuing Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender or the Issuing Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy or liquidity (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority does or shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s or such corporation’s capital or liquidity as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or under any Letter of Credit to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such application or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s or such corporation’s policies with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity and such Lender’s or the Issuing Lender’s treatment of its Revolving Commitments and Letters of Credit for internal purposes as of the date on which it became a party hereto) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender or the Issuing Lender to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such request), (i) each Borrower shall pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such corporation, as the case may be, for such reduction solely with respect to such Borrower’s Loans and Letters of Credit and (ii) the Borrowers shall, jointly and severally, pay to such Lender or the Issuing Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Lender or such corporation, as the case may be, for such reduction with respect to this Agreement or the Revolving Commitments generally and not solely with respect to any particular Borrower’s Loans and Letters of Credit; provided that such amounts shall be no greater than amounts that such Lender or the Issuing Lender is generally charging other borrowers or account parties similarly situated to and of similar creditworthiness to the Borrowers.

59

- [Reserved.]

- A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.11 submitted by any Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrowers shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The agreements in this Section 2.11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the expiration, cancellation, or other termination of the Letters of Credit, and the payment of the Revolving Credit Loans, the Competitive Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder (the date on which all of the foregoing shall have occurred, the “ Final Date ”),

until the first anniversary of the Final Date. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 2.11, no Borrower shall be obligated to pay any greater amounts than such Lender(s) or Issuing Lender(s) is (are) generally charging other borrowers or account parties similarly situated to and of similar creditworthiness to the Borrowers.

- For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 2.11 (i) shall not entitle any Recipient to compensation in respect of any Excluded Taxes, (ii) shall not apply to (A) Indemnified Taxes imposed on payments by or on account of any obligations of the Borrowers hereunder or under any Loan Document or (B) Other Taxes, it being understood that such Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes shall be governed exclusively by Section 2.12, and (iii) shall not relieve any Lender or Issuing Lender of any obligation pursuant to Section 2.12.

SECTION 2.12 Taxes .

- All payments made by any Loan Party under this Agreement and the Notes shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any law. If any Withholding Agent determines in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by any Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made. Each Loan Party shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

- Indemnification by each Loan Party . Without duplication of any payments made pursuant to Section 2.12(a), each Loan Party shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient for any Indemnified Taxes that are directly paid or payable by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including amounts paid or payable under this Section 2.12(b)) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto. The indemnity under this Section 2.12(b) shall be paid within 10 days after the Recipient delivers to the applicable Loan Party a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so paid or payable by such Recipient and describing the basis for the indemnification claim. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent.

60

- Indemnification by the Lenders . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that the applicable Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of such Loan Party to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.12(c) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error.

(d)
Status of Lenders

- Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.12(d)(ii)(A) through (E) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.12(d). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.

- Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the applicable Borrower or Loan Party (or, if such Borrower or Loan Party is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, its sole owner) is a U.S. Person, any Lender (or if such Lender is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, its sole owner) with respect to such Borrower shall, if it is legally eligible to do so, deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies reasonably requested by such Borrower and the Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party hereto, duly completed and executed copies of whichever of the following is applicable:

and (2) with respect to any other applicable payments under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business
profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;

61

- IRS Form W-8ECI;

(D)

- IRS Form
W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E and (2) a certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit H
(a “
U.S. Tax Certificate
”) to the effect that such Lender is not (a) a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (b) a “10
percent shareholder” of the applicable Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, (c) a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (d) conducting a trade or business in the United States
with which the relevant interest payments are effectively connected;

(E)

- an IRS
Form W-8IMY on behalf of itself and (2) the relevant forms prescribed in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (F) of this subsection (d)(ii) that would be required of each such beneficial owner or partner of such partnership if such beneficial owner or
partner were a Lender;
provided
,
however
, that if the Lender is a partnership and one or more of its partners are claiming the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, such Lender may provide a U.S. Tax
Certificate on behalf of such partners; or

- any other form prescribed by law as a basis for claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax together with such supplementary documentation necessary to enable such Borrower or Loan Party or the Administrative Agent to determine the amount of Tax (if any) required by law to be withheld.

- If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.12(d)(iii), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

- Treatment of Certain Refunds . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.12 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.12), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.12 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 2.12(e) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.12(e), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.12(e) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

62

Each party’s obligation under this Section 2.12 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of this Agreement, the expiration, cancellation, or other termination of the Letters of Credit, and the payment of the Revolving Credit Loans, the Competitive Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

Each applicable L/C Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with the Issuing Lender that, if the Issuing Lender notifies it that a draft or other demand for payment has been paid under any Letter of Credit for which the Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed in full by the applicable Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Issuing Lender upon demand at the Issuing Lender’s address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant’s Applicable Percentage of the Tranche A Commitments or the Tranche B Commitments, as applicable, of the amount of such draft or other demand for payment, or any part thereof, which is not so reimbursed.

denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not in fact made available to the Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three (3) Business Days after the date such payment
is due, the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder (or, if such Letter of Credit is
denominated in an Alternate Currency, the rate per annum applicable to Term Benchmark Loans for Interest Periods of one month). A certificate of the Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

- Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its pro rata share of such payment in accordance with this Section 3.4, the Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the applicable Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of any collateral applied thereto by the Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, the Issuing Lender will promptly distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share thereof; provided

Each such payment shall be made to the Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein in the currency of such Letter of Credit and in immediately available funds.

- Interest shall be payable on the Dollar Equivalent of any and all amounts remaining unpaid by the applicable Borrower under this Article III from the date such amounts become payable (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full at the rate which would be payable on any outstanding ABR Loans which were then overdue.

- Each drawing under any Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars shall constitute a request by the applicable Borrower to the Administrative Agent for a borrowing pursuant to Section 2.2(d) of ABR Loans in the amount of such drawing. The Borrowing Date with respect to such borrowing shall be the date of such drawing.

SECTION 3.6 Obligations Absolute .

- Each Borrower’s obligations under this Article III shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which such Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Lender, any L/C Participant or any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit.

- Each Borrower also agrees that the Issuing Lender and the L/C Participants shall not be responsible for, and such Borrower’s Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5(a) shall not be affected by, among other things, (i) the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or (ii) any dispute between or among such Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, (iii) any claims whatsoever of such Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee, (iv) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, or (v) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a Borrower’s obligations hereunder.

- The Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for direct damages resulting from errors or omissions caused by the Issuing Lender’s gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of its obligations under this Agreement (as determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).

71

- Each Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued for its account or the related drafts or documents, if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in accordance with any applicable standard of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York (or other law applicable to such Letters of Credit), shall be binding on such Borrower and shall not result in any liability of the Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to such Borrower. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that (i) with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit, (ii) the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, (x) assert or waive application of Article 17 and Article 45 of the Uniform Customs, or (y) accept as a draft any written demand or request for payment under a Letter of Credit even if non-negotiable or not in the form of a draft, and (iii) with respect to documents presented which the Issuing Lender determines do not appear on their face to comply with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender may, in its sole discretion, approach the applicable Borrower for a waiver of the discrepancy(ies), but neither requesting such a waiver from such Borrower nor receiving such a waiver from such Borrower shall obligate the Issuing Lender to make payment against such documents. The applicable Borrower will notify the Issuing Lender in writing of any objection such Borrower may have to the Issuing Lender’s issuance or amendment of any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender’s honor or dishonor of any presentation under any Letter of Credit, or any other action or inaction taken or proposed to be taken by the Issuing Lender under or in connection with this Agreement or any Letter of Credit. The applicable Borrower’s notice of objection must be delivered to the Issuing Lender within five (5) Business Days after such Borrower receives notice of the action or inaction it objects to. Any Borrower’s failure to give such notice of objection within five (5) Business Days after such Borrower’s actual receipt of notice of the action or inaction it objects to shall automatically waive such Borrower’s objection, authorize or ratify the Issuing Lender’s action or inaction, and preclude such Borrower from raising the objection as a defense or claim against the Issuing Lender.

SECTION 3.7 Letter of Credit Payments .

If any draft or other demand for payment shall be presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall, within the time allowed by applicable law or the terms of the Letter of Credit, examine all documents purporting to be a demand for payment and promptly after such examination notify the applicable Borrower of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of the Issuing Lender to the applicable Borrower in connection with any draft or other demand for payment presented for payment under any Letter of Credit issued for such Borrower’s account shall, in addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit, be limited to determining that the documents (including each draft or other demand for payment) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment appear on their face to be in conformity with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit.

From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Lender shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term “Issuing Lender” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Lender, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Lenders, as the context shall require.

SECTION 9.1 The Agents .

For purposes of this Section 9.1 and Section 10.6, the term “ Related Parties ” shall mean, with respect to any specified Person, (i) any Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common Control with such specified Person, and (ii) the respective directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors of such specified Person and of any other Person referred to in the preceding clause (i).

- Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender and each Issuing Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, each of the Loan Documents to which the Administrative Agent is a party, and to exercise all rights, powers and remedies that the Administrative Agent may have under such Loan Documents.

- The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and each Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with such bank (an “ Administrative Agent Affiliate ”) may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

- The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein, and its duties are entirely administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

- the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or similar duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (and it is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” (or any similar term) herein or in any other Loan Document with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary duty or implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law, and that such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties); additionally, each Lender agrees that it will not assert any claim against the Administrative Agent based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby,

- the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise or refrain from exercising as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided herein), for which the Administrative Agent shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting, and, unless and until revoked in writing, such directions shall be binding upon each Lender and each Issuing Lender; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that (A) the Administrative Agent in good faith believes exposes it to liability unless the Administrative Agent receives an indemnification and is exculpated in a manner satisfactory to it from the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders with respect to such action or (B) is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or applicable law, including any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any requirement of law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of debtors or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any requirement of law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of debtors; provided, further, that the Administrative Agent may seek clarification or direction from the Required Lenders prior to the exercise of any such instructed action and may refrain from acting until such clarification or direction has been provided, and

The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided herein) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (which shall be deemed to exist only if determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and non-appealable judgment). The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default other than nonpayment of principal or interest unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by Kimco or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or in any other Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent, or satisfaction of any condition that expressly refers to the matters described therein being acceptable or satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Borrowers or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for any failure of the Borrowers to perform their obligations hereunder or thereunder.

- The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

94

- The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agent except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agent.

- Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving 30 days’ prior written notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Lender and Kimco. If a Bankruptcy Event shall occur with respect to the Administrative Agent, then effective on the date that is thirty (30) Business Days after the date of such Bankruptcy Event, the Administrative Agent automatically and without any further action by any Person, shall be removed as Administrative Agent, and at the end of such thirty (30) Business Day period the Administrative Agent shall be deemed discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document. By the Required Lenders’ giving at least thirty (30) Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent and Kimco, the Administrative Agent may be removed, by action of the Required Lenders (excluding the bank serving as Administrative Agent (the “ Agent Bank ”)), (i) at any time for gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the Required Lenders (excluding for such determination the Agent Bank), or (ii) in the event that the Agent Bank, in its capacity as a Lender, shall have assigned all of its outstanding Revolving Commitments, Loans, and its Applicable Percentage of the L/C Obligations to another bank, financial institution or other entity pursuant to Section 10.6, and at the end of such thirty (30) Business Day period the Agent Bank shall be deemed discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Documents, provided that it is a condition to the removal of the Administrative Agent under clause (ii) above in the circumstance in which the Agent Bank is the Issuing Lender hereunder, that all outstanding Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender (including Letters of Credit issued by any Affiliate of the Agent Bank) hereunder shall be returned to the Issuing Lender for cancellation, that the Issuing Lender shall be reimbursed for all drafts or other demands for payment under the Letters of Credit that have not yet been reimbursed by the Borrowers or paid by the L/C Participants (except to the extent of the Applicable Percentage of L/C Obligations assigned by the Agent Bank), that all fees and expenses accrued and payable to the Issuing Lender be paid, and that the Issuing Lender shall be deemed to be replaced under Section 3.9(a) hereof. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with Kimco, to appoint a successor. In the case of resignation by the Administrative Agent, if no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or a Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with any such bank.

The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this Article, including Section 9.2, shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

- Notices and other communications to the Lenders and the Issuing Lender hereunder may be delivered or furnished by using Electronic Systems pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices pursuant to Article II unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Lender. The Administrative Agent or the Borrowers may, in their discretion, agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided , further , that (x) approval of such procedures may be limited to particular notices or communications, (y) for the avoidance of doubt, as and from the date hereof until the Borrowers provide written notice to the Administrative Agent otherwise, the Borrowers do not agree to accept notices or other communications hereunder by electronic communications, and (z) for the avoidance of doubt, as and from the date hereof until the Administrative Agent provides written notice to the Borrowers otherwise, the Administrative Agent does not agree to accept notices or other communications hereunder by electronic communications.

Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the sender’s receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by the “return receipt requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), and (ii) notices or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient, at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing clause (i), of notification that such notice or communication is available and identifying the website address therefor; provided

that, for both clauses (i) and (ii) above, if such notice, email or other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or communication shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient.

- Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto.

102

(d)
Electronic Systems

- Each Loan Party agrees that the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make Communications (as defined below) available to the Issuing Lender and the other Lenders by posting the Communications (as defined below) on Debt Domain, Intralinks, Syndtrak, ClearPar or a substantially similar Electronic System.

- Any Electronic System used by the Administrative Agent and the Communications are provided “as is” and “as available.” The Agent Parties (as defined below) do not warrant the adequacy or completeness of the Communications or the adequacy of such Electronic Systems and expressly disclaim liability for errors or omissions in the Communications or the Electronic System. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of third-party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by any Agent Party in connection with the Communications or any Electronic System. Each of the Lenders, each of the Issuing Lenders and the Borrowers acknowledges and agrees that the distribution of material through the Electronic System is not necessarily secure, that the Administrative Agent is not responsible for approving or vetting the representatives or contacts of any Lender that are added to the Electronic System, and that there may be confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution. Other than (solely with respect to direct damages arising therefrom) in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or material breach of this Agreement by, an Agent Party (as defined below) to the extent determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, in no event shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the “ Agent Parties ”) have any liability to the Borrowers or the other Loan Parties, any Lender, the Issuing Lender or any other Person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrowers’, any Loan Party’s or the Administrative Agent’s transmission of Communications through an Electronic System. “ Communications ” means, collectively, any notice, demand, communication, information, document or other material provided by or on behalf of any Loan Party pursuant to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated therein which is distributed by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Lender by means of electronic communications pursuant to this Section, including through an Electronic System.

- Each Lender and each Issuing Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence) specifying that Communications have been posted to the Electronic System shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender and Issuing Lender agrees (i) to notify the Administrative Agent in writing (which could be in the form of electronic communication) from time to time of such Lender’s or Issuing Lender’s (as applicable) email address to which the foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and (ii) that the foregoing notice may be sent to such email address.

- Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Lender or any Borrower to give any notice or other communication pursuant to any Loan Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document.

SECTION 10.3 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies .

No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

103

SECTION 10.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties .

All representations and warranties made hereunder, in the other Loan Documents and in any document, certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the making of the extensions of credit hereunder.

The agreements in this Section 10.5 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the expiration, cancellation, or other termination of the Letters of Credit, and the payment of the Revolving Credit Loans, the Competitive Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

SECTION 10.6 Successors and Assigns .

For purposes of this Section 10.6 the term “Related Parties” shall have the meaning given thereto in Section 9.1 hereof.

- The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of Credit (an “ Issuing Lender Affiliate ”)), except that (i) none of the Loan Parties may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Loan Party without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Issuing Lender Affiliate), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

104

- (i) Subject

to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (other than an Ineligible Institution) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment, participations in Letters of Credit and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:

- Kimco, provided

that (I) no consent of Kimco shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund (as defined below), or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee and (II) Kimco shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice thereof;

- the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of any Revolving Commitment or Loan to an assignee that is a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; and

- the Issuing Lender.

- Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:

- except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Revolving Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Tranche A Commitment or Tranche B Commitment or Tranche A Loans or Tranche B Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption (as defined below) with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless Kimco and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of Kimco shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

- each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of its Tranche A Commitment or its Tranche B Commitment, as applicable, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;

- the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption substantially in the form of Exhibit A or in any other form (including electronic records generated by the use of an electronic platform) approved by the Administrative Agent (an “ Assignment

and Assumption ”) (or to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an Electronic System as to which the Administrative Agent and the parties to the Assignment and Assumption are participants), together with a processing and recordation fee of $4,000 (which, except as provided in Section 2.15, shall not be payable by the Borrowers);

105

- the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in the form approved by the Administrative Agent (an “ Administrative Questionnaire ”); and

- assignments shall not be permitted to be made to any Ineligible Institution.

- Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.11, 2.12, 2.13 and 10.5). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

- The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Tranche A Commitment and Tranche B Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and payments made by the Issuing Lender pursuant to the Letters of Credit, owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “ Register ”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers, the Issuing Lender and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

- Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in this paragraph (b) and any written consent to such assignment required by this paragraph (b), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.9(b), 3.4, 3.5 or 9.2, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

106

- Any Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower, the Administrative Agent, or the Issuing Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (other than any Ineligible Institution) (a “ Participant ”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations in respect of its Tranche A Commitment or its Tranche B Commitment, as applicable, under this Agreement and under the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment, participations in Letters of Credit and the Loans owing to it); provided

that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (C) the Borrowers, the other Loan Parties, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the proviso to
Section 10.1 that affects such Participant. Each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 2.12
- (it being understood that the documentation requirement under Section 2.12(d) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
Section;
provided
that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.9 and 2.15 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Sections 2.11 or 2.12, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.11(b) as though it were a
Lender,
provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 10.11(a) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register
on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “
Participant Register
”);
provided
that
no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Revolving Commitments, Loans, Letters
of Credit, or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Revolving Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c)
of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation
for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

- Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in, all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

SECTION 10.7 Disclosure .

Subject to Section 10.19, each Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or assignee (each, a “ Transferee ”) and any prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such Lender’s possession concerning such Borrower and its Affiliates which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of such Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of such Borrower in connection with such Lender’s credit evaluation of such Borrower and its Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Agreement.

107

SECTION 10.8 Increases of Loan Commitments .

Kimco may from time to time request (i) increases in the aggregate amount of the Tranche A Commitments or the Tranche B Commitments (“ New Revolving Commitments ”) and/or (ii) new term loan commitments to be established (“ New Term Commitments ”, and together with the New Revolving Commitments, the “ Incremental Commitments ”), in minimum increments of $50,000,000 (or whole multiples of $5,000,000 in excess of $50,000,000), provided that the total combined amount of the Incremental Commitments under this Section 10.8 shall be limited to $750,000,000 in the aggregate. Any Lender or, with the consent of the Administrative Agent and, in the case of a New Revolving Commitment, each Issuing Lender (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and Kimco, any additional bank, financial institution or other entity that is not then a Lender may elect to become a Lender hereunder and make an Incremental Commitment. No Lender shall have any obligation to make any Incremental Commitment, nor shall the Administrative Agent, the Joint Lead Arrangers or the Syndication Agents have any obligation to locate banks, financial institutions or other entities willing to make any Incremental Commitment. If (x) existing or new Lenders are willing to provide such New Revolving Commitments, the Revolving Commitments may be increased from time to time by the addition of a new Lender or the increase of the Revolving Commitment of an existing Lender (each, a “ New Revolving Lender ”, and the loans made pursuant to any New Revolving Commitment being referred to herein as “ New Revolving Loans ”) or (y) Lenders are willing to provide such New Term Commitments, term loans may be made hereunder (the “ New Term Loans ”) by such Lenders (each, a “ New Term Lender ”). Each Incremental Commitment under this Section 10.8 is subject to the following conditions:

- Each of the representations and warranties made by Kimco in or pursuant to the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (or, in the case of any representation and warranty that is qualified as to “materiality,” “Material Adverse Effect” or similar language, true and correct (after giving effect to any qualification therein) in all respects) on and as of the effective date of such Incremental Commitment as if made on and as of such date except for representations and warranties expressly stated to relate to a specific earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties were true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date; and

(b)

- No Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing on the effective date of such Incremental Commitment or after giving effect thereto and (ii) Kimco would be in compliance with each financial covenant set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of Section 7.1 if the ratio or amount referred to
therein were to be calculated as of the most recent Test Period as to which a compliance certificate has been delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(b) after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of Indebtedness, if any, under such Incremental
Commitments, on the effective date of such Incremental Commitments, and the use of proceeds thereof).

Each request for an Incremental Commitment under this Section 10.8 shall constitute a representation and warranty by Kimco as of the date of such Incremental Commitment that the conditions contained in this Section 10.8 have been satisfied, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Responsible Officer of Kimco to such effect.

Any Incremental Commitments hereunder shall be evidenced by the execution and delivery of an amendment to this Agreement by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders (in the case of New Revolving Commitments) and the New Revolving Lenders or New Term Lenders, as applicable, providing such Incremental Commitments, a copy of which shall be forwarded to each Lender by the Administrative Agent promptly after execution thereof. Each such amendment executed in connection with an Incremental Commitment hereunder may, without the consent of any other Lenders or (except in the case of New Revolving Commitments) Issuing Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the good faith judgment of Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 10.8 and the Incremental Commitments, subject to approval by the Borrowers and the New Revolving Lenders or New Term Lenders, as applicable, including without limitation to (x) include the New Revolving Lenders and/or New Term Lenders as “Lenders” hereunder, (y) to include the New Revolving Loans and New Term Loans as “Loans” hereunder, and (z) to include the New Revolving Lenders and their Applicable Percentages and/or the New Term Lenders and their New Term Loans for purposes of the definition of “Required Lenders”. All such amendments and joinder agreements entered into with the Borrowers by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders (in the case of New Revolving Commitments) and the New Revolving Lenders or New Term Lenders, as applicable, shall be binding and conclusive on all Lenders.

108

Following the giving of any notice pursuant to this Section 10.10(a) and prior to the effectiveness of any such Subsidiary becoming a Subsidiary Borrower, if the designation of such Subsidiary Borrower obligates the Administrative Agent or any Lender to comply with “know your customer” or similar identification procedures in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the applicable Subsidiary Borrower shall, promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender (but only if the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made such a request by a date that is no later than five (5) Business Days after the giving of notice pursuant to Section 10.10(a) designating such Subsidiary Borrower), supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably and customarily requested by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in order for the Administrative Agent or such Lender to be satisfied (in good faith) it has complied with all necessary “know your customer” or other similar verifications under all applicable laws and regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) with respect to any Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, any Lender may, with notice to the Administrative Agent and Kimco, fulfill its Revolving Commitment by causing an Affiliate of such Lender to act as the Lender in respect of such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower (and such Lender shall, to the extent of Loans made to and participations in Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, be deemed for all purposes hereof to have pro tanto assigned such Loans and participations to such Affiliate in compliance with the provisions of Section 10.6; and (y) as soon as practicable and in any event within seven (7) Business Days after notice of the designation under this Section of a Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, any Lender that (I) may not legally lend to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower, or (II) would incur or suffer materially adverse regulatory or legal consequences by lending to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower and, in either case (I) or (II), is generally not lending to other borrowers similarly situated to such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower (a “ Protesting Lender ”) shall so notify Kimco and the Administrative Agent in writing. With respect to each Protesting Lender, Kimco shall, effective on or before the date that such Foreign Subsidiary Borrower shall have the right to borrow hereunder, either (I) (A) replace such Protesting Lender in accordance with Section 2.15 or (B) notify the Administrative Agent and such Protesting Lender that the Revolving Commitments of such Protesting Lender shall be terminated (whereupon such Revolving Commitments shall be terminated); provided that, in the case of this clause (B), (1) Kimco shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender, which consents shall not unreasonably be withheld, and (2) such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans (other than Competitive Loans), accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the relevant Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), or (II) cancel its request to designate such Subsidiary as a “ Subsidiary Borrower ” hereunder.

110

- At the election of Kimco at any time and from time to time, at the time of such election, one or more Wholly Owned Subsidiaries shall become a guarantor of the Revolving Credit Facility (each, a “ Subsidiary Guarantor ”) by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, a Subsidiary Guarantee; provided that (x) each such Wholly Owned Subsidiary shall satisfy the Baseline Conditions on and as of the date such Wholly Owned Subsidiary delivers its Subsidiary Guarantee and (y) Kimco shall be deemed to represent and warrant as of such date that such proposed Subsidiary Guarantor is a Wholly Owned Subsidiary. If the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor obligates the Administrative Agent or any Lender to comply with “know your customer” or similar identification procedures in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor shall, promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably and customarily requested by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in order for the Administrative Agent or such Lender to be satisfied (in good faith) it has complied with all necessary “know your customer” or other similar verifications under all applicable laws and regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, no Wholly Owned Subsidiary that is not a U.S. Person (or, if such Wholly Owned Subsidiary is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, has an owner that is not a U.S. Person) shall guarantee any obligation of any Borrower that is a U.S. Person (or, if such Borrower is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, of its owner).

- A Subsidiary Borrower shall be released as a Borrower hereunder upon written request by Kimco; provided that (i) any Loans to and/or other obligations of such Subsidiary Borrower proposed to be released shall have been either (A) repaid (and any outstanding Letters of Credit issued for its account shall have been fully cash collateralized unless Kimco is a co-applicant thereof) or (B) assumed (pursuant to a written agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Administrative Agent), concurrently with or prior to such release, by Kimco or by another Subsidiary Borrower (which other Subsidiary Borrower satisfies the Baseline Conditions at the time of such assumption), (ii) there is no Event of Default after giving effect to such release, (iii) Kimco is in compliance with each of the financial covenants set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of Section 7.1 if the ratio or amount referred to therein were to be calculated as of such date, but after giving effect to such release ( provided that for the purposes of determining such compliance, Gross Asset Value shall be determined for the most recent Test Period as to which a compliance certificate has been delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(b), after giving effect to such release), and (iv) Kimco has furnished to the Administrative Agent a certificate of its chief financial officer or other authorized officer as to the matters referred in the preceding sub-clauses (ii) and (iii)

- A Subsidiary Guarantor shall be released from any Subsidiary Guarantee upon written request by Kimco; provided that (i) there is no Event of Default after giving effect to such release (including any changes resulting from any Property’s ceasing to be an Unencumbered Property if such released guarantor immediately prior to giving effect to such release was an Obligated Property Owner in respect thereof), (ii) Kimco is in compliance with each of the financial covenants set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of Section 7.1 if the ratio or amount referred to therein were to be calculated as of such date, but after giving effect to such release (including any changes resulting from any Property’s ceasing to be an Unencumbered Property if such released guarantor was an Obligated Property Owner in respect thereof immediately prior to giving effect to such release and provided that for the purposes of determining such compliance, Gross Asset Value shall be determined for the most recent Test Period as to which a compliance certificate has been delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(b)), and (iii) Kimco has furnished to the Administrative Agent a certificate of its chief financial officer or other authorized financial officer as to the matters referred to in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii).

111

- In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, each Lender and each of its Affiliates shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrowers any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrowers to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon and during the continuance of any Event of Default, to set off and appropriate and apply against any amounts due hereunder or under any Notes at such time, any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any other credits, obligations, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any of its Affiliates or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of such Borrower.

If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment against any Borrower in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or from any currency other than the Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to as the “ Judgment Currency ”) an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be made, at the Dollar Equivalent of such amount, in each case, as of the date immediately preceding the day on which the judgment is given (such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the “ Judgment Currency Conversion Date ”).

SECTION 10.22 Sharing Event .

- Upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event, automatically (and without the taking of any action) (x) all then outstanding Term Benchmark Loans and RFR Loans denominated in an Alternate Currency shall be automatically converted into Loans denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent, as determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with this Agreement, of the aggregate principal amount of such Term Benchmark Loans and RFR Loans on the date such Sharing Event first occurred, which Loans denominated in Dollars (i) shall thereafter be deemed to be ABR Loans and (ii) shall be immediately due and payable on the date such Sharing Event occurred) and (y) all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts owing with respect to such Term Benchmark Loans and RFR Loans shall be immediately due and payable in Dollars, in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts.

116

- Upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event, and after giving effect to any automatic conversion pursuant to Section 10.22(a), each Lender shall (and hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to) purchase and sell (in each case in Dollars) undivided participating interests in all Loans (other than Competitive Rate Loans) outstanding to, and any unpaid amounts the Issuing Lender has disbursed under a Letter of Credit owing by, any Borrower in amounts such that each Lender shall have a share of the outstanding Loans (other than Competitive Loans) and unpaid amounts the Issuing Lender has disbursed under a Letter of Credit then owing by any Borrower equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Revolving Commitments (although if because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates any Lender would be required to purchase such participations after giving effect to which such Lender’s Loans and Letter of Credit participations (including participations therein purchased pursuant to this Section) would exceed such Lender’s Revolving Commitment, then such participations shall be in an amount after giving effect to which such Lender’s Loans and Letter of Credit participations (including participations therein purchased pursuant to this Section) would equal such Lender’s Revolving Commitment). Upon any such occurrence, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender and shall specify the amount of Dollars required from such Lender in order to effect the purchases and sales by the various Lenders of participating interests in the amounts required above (together with accrued interest with respect to the period for the last Interest Payment Date through the date of the Sharing Event); provided that, in the event that a Sharing Event shall have occurred, each Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, automatically and without request, such participating interests. Promptly upon receipt of such request, each Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (in immediately available funds in Dollars) the net amounts as specified by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver the amounts so received to the various Lenders in such amounts as are needed to effect the purchases and sales of participations as provided above. Promptly following receipt thereof, each Lender which has sold participations in any of its Loans and Letter of Credit participations (through the Administrative Agent) will deliver to each Lender (through the Administrative Agent) which has so purchased a participating interest a participation certificate dated the date of receipt of such funds and in such amount. It is understood that the amount of funds delivered by each Lender shall be calculated on a net basis, giving effect to both the sales and purchases of participations by the various Lenders as required above.

- Upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event, (i) no further Loans shall be made, (ii) all amounts from
time to time accruing with respect to, and all amounts from time to time payable on account of, any outstanding Term Benchmark Loans and RFR Loans denominated in any Alternate Currency (including any interest and other amounts which were accrued but
unpaid on the date of such purchase) shall be converted to Loans denominated in Dollars in accordance with Section 10.22(a) and be payable immediately in Dollars as if such Term Benchmark Loans and RFR Loans had originally been made in Dollars and
shall be distributed by the relevant Lenders (or their affiliates) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders which made such Loans or are participating therein and (iii) the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders shall be automatically
terminated. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, the failure of any Lender to purchase its participating interest in any Loans upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to
purchase its participating interests in a timely manner, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to purchase the participating interest to be purchased by such other Lender on any date.

(d)

If any amount required to be paid by any Lender pursuant to
Section 10.22(b) is not paid to the Administrative Agent within one (1) Business Day following the date upon which such Lender receives notice from the Administrative Agent of the amount of its participations required to be purchased pursuant to said
Section, such Lender shall also pay to the Administrative Agent on demand an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount so required to be paid by such Lender for the purchase of its participations
times
- the daily average Federal Funds
Effective Rate during the period from and including the date of request for payment to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Administrative Agent
times
- a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that
elapsed during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to be paid by any Lender pursuant to Section 10.22(b) is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent within three (3) Business Days following the
date upon which such Lender receives notice from the Administrative Agent as to the amount of participations required to be purchased by it, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover from such Lender on demand, such amount with interest
thereon calculated from such request date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans hereunder. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts payable by any Lender pursuant to this Section shall be
deemed conclusive absent manifest error. Amounts payable under this Section shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Lenders;
provided
that, if the Administrative Agent (in its sole discretion) has elected to
fund on behalf of such Lender the amounts owing to such Lenders, then the amounts shall be paid to the Administrative Agent for its own account.

117

- Whenever, at any time after the relevant Lenders have received from any Lenders purchases of participations in any Loans pursuant to this Section, the Lenders receive any payment on account thereof, such Lenders will distribute to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the various Lenders participating therein, such Lenders’ participating interests in such amounts (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such participations were outstanding) in like funds as received; provided , that in the event that such payment received by any Lenders are required to be returned, the Lenders who received previous distributions in respect of their participating interests therein will return to the respective Lenders any portion thereof previously so distributed to them in like funds as such payment is required to be returned by the respective Lenders.

- Each Lender’s obligation to purchase participating interests pursuant to this Section shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against any other Lender, any Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of Kimco or any other Person, (iv) any breach of this Agreement by Kimco, any of its Subsidiaries or any Lender or any other Person, or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, upon any purchase of participations as required above, each Lender which has purchased such participations shall be entitled to receive from the applicable Borrower any increased costs and indemnities directly from the applicable Borrower to the same extent as if it were the direct Lender as opposed to a participant therein. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that, upon the occurrence of a Sharing Event and after giving effect to the requirements of this Section, increased taxes may be owing by such Borrower pursuant to Section 2.12, which taxes shall be paid (to the extent provided in Section 2.12) by such Borrower, without any claim that the increased taxes are not payable because same resulted from the participations effected as otherwise required by this Section.

This Agreement shall, upon the effectiveness of the amendment and restatement contemplated hereby, replace and supersede the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement in its entirety, except as expressly provided in this Section 10.23. For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto (including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in its capacities as administrative agent under the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement and under this Agreement) understands and agrees that, upon the effectiveness of the amendment and restatement contemplated hereby, without any further action, (a) the commitments of the Existing Revolving Lenders and the Existing Issuing Lender to make any loans or advance any credit, including letters of credit, as applicable, under the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement or under any other Existing Loan Document shall be terminated, (b) any reimbursement obligations of the Existing Revolving Lenders to the Existing Issuing Lender and any obligations of the Existing Revolving Lenders to purchase participations in the Existing Issuing Lender’s obligations and rights in respect of each existing Letter of Credit shall be terminated (subject to Section 3.10), (c) excluding those obligations that are specified in the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement or in any of the other Existing Loan Documents as surviving that respective agreement’s termination (which, as so specified, shall survive without prejudice and remain in full force and effect), all Existing Obligations and all Existing Guaranteed Obligations shall be deemed paid in full, released and discharged, (d) the Lenders party hereto shall have Revolving Commitments in the amounts set forth in Schedule 1.1A , (e) the “Revolving Credit Loans” outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement shall become Revolving Credit Loans under this Agreement, and (f) the Lenders’ interests in the Revolving Credit Loans and participations in the Letters of Credit shall be reallocated and continued in a cashless roll transaction on the Effective Date ratably in accordance with each Lender’s applicable Revolving Commitments, and the Lenders shall make such purchases of Revolving Credit Loans from each other as necessary to effect such reallocation. As soon as reasonably practicable after its receipt of any Note requested by a Lender hereunder on the Effective Date, to the extent such Lender was a party to the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement and had a promissory note issued to such Lender under the terms of the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement, such Lender will promptly return to the Borrowers, marked “Substituted” or “Cancelled”, as the case may be, any promissory notes of the Borrowers held by such Lender pursuant to the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement. Each Lender party to this Agreement that was a party to the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement hereby waives its rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 2.13 in connection with prepayment or conversion of any Eurocurrency Loans (including any “Eurocurrency Loans” under the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement) as a result of any prepayment or conversion of Revolving Credit Loans on the Effective Date or the reallocation of the Revolving Credit Loans on the Effective Date described above.

SECTION 10.24 Interest Rate Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the “ Maximum Rate ”). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the applicable Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

SECTION 10.25 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

- the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and

- the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:

- a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;

- a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or

119

- the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.

SECTION 10.26 Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs .

To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Swap Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support “ QFC Credit Support ” and each such QFC a “ Supported QFC ”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “ U.S. Special Resolution Regimes ”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):

In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “ Covered Party ”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

As used in this Section 10.26, the following terms have the following meanings:

“ BHC Act Affiliate ” of a party means an “affiliate’ (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.

ARTICLE XI

GUARANTEE BY KIMCO

SECTION 11.1 Guarantee .

In order to induce the Lenders to extend credit hereunder, Kimco hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lender Parties and the Administrative Agent, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the due and punctual payment of all Obligations of all the Subsidiary Borrowers (collectively, the “ Guaranteed Obligations ”). Kimco agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligations. Each and every default in payment or performance on any Guaranteed Obligation shall give rise to a separate cause of action hereunder, and separate suits may be brought hereunder as each cause of action arises.

SECTION 11.2 Guaranteed Obligations Not Waived .

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Kimco waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Subsidiary Borrower or to any other
guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the obligations of Kimco hereunder shall not be affected by
- the failure of any Lender Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce or exercise any right or remedy against the applicable Borrower or any other Loan Party under the provisions of the Loan Documents or otherwise; (b) any rescission, waiver,
amendment or modification of, or any release from any of the terms or provisions of any Loan Document or any other agreement; (c) the failure or delay of any Lender Party for any reason whatsoever to exercise any right or remedy against any other
guarantor of the Obligations; (d) the failure of any Lender Party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy under any Loan Document, any guarantee or any other agreement or instrument; (e) any default, failure or delay, willful or
otherwise, in the performance of any Guaranteed Obligations; (f) any change in the corporate existence or structure of any Borrower; (g) the existence of any claims or set-off rights that Kimco may have; (h) any law, regulation, decree or order of any
jurisdiction or any event affecting any term of a guaranteed obligation; or (i) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of Kimco or otherwise operate as a discharge or
exoneration of Kimco as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of Kimco to subrogation.

SECTION 11.3 Guarantee of Payment .

Kimco agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and not of collection, that such guarantee may be enforced at any time and from time to time, on one or more occasions, during the continuance of any Event of Default, without any prior demand or enforcement in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, and that Kimco waives any right to require that any resort be had by any Lender Party to any other Guarantor or other guarantee, or to any security held for payment of any Guaranteed Obligations. The solicitation of, or the delivery by Kimco of, any confirmation or reaffirmation of this Agreement under any circumstance shall not give rise to any inference as to the continued effectiveness of this Agreement in any other circumstance in which the confirmation or reaffirmation hereof has not been solicited or has not been delivered (whether or not solicited), and the obligations of Kimco hereunder shall continue in effect as herein provided notwithstanding any solicitation or delivery of any confirmation or reaffirmation hereof, or any failure to solicit or to deliver any such confirmation or reaffirmation, under any circumstances. This is a continuing guaranty of the payment of all Guaranteed Obligations.

121

SECTION 11.4 No Discharge or Diminishment of Guarantee .

The obligations of Kimco under this guarantee shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason (other than the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations), including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, amendment, modification, alteration or compromise of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any collateral security or guarantee or other accommodation in respect thereof, and shall not be subject to any defense or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any Loan Document or any provision thereof (or of this Agreement or any provision hereof) or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of Kimco under this guarantee shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by any change of location, form or jurisdiction of any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person, any merger, consolidation or amalgamation of any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person into or with any other Person, any sale, lease or transfer of any of the assets of any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person to any other Person, any other change of form, structure, or status under any law in respect of any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person, or any other occurrence, circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, whether foreseen or unforeseen, that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable defense, release, exoneration, or discharge or that might otherwise limit recourse against any Subsidiary Borrower or Kimco or any other Person. The obligations of Kimco under this guarantee shall extend to all Guaranteed Obligations without limitation of amount, and Kimco agrees that it shall be obligated to honor its guarantee hereunder whether or not any other Guarantor (i) has been called to honor its guarantee, (ii) has failed to honor its guarantee in whole or in part, or (iii) has been released for any reason whatsoever from its obligations under its guarantee.

SECTION 11.5 Defenses Waived; Maturity of Guaranteed Obligations .

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Kimco waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Subsidiary Borrower or any other guarantor or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Subsidiary Borrower, other than the final payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Lender Parties may, at their election, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any other accommodation with any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person (including any other Guarantor) or exercise any other right or remedy available to them against such Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person (including any other Guarantor), without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully and finally paid in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Kimco waives any defense arising out of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of Kimco against any Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person, as the case may be, or any security. Kimco agrees that, as between Kimco, on the one hand, and the Lender Parties, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated for the purposes of Kimco’s guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration as to any Subsidiary Borrower in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations guaranteed hereby (other than any notices and cure periods expressly granted to any Subsidiary Borrower in this Agreement or any other Loan Document evidencing or securing the Guaranteed Obligations) and (ii) in the event of any such acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable in full by Kimco for purposes of this Agreement.

122

SECTION 11.6 Agreement to Pay; Subordination .

In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that any Lender Party has at law or in equity against Kimco by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Subsidiary Borrower to pay (after the giving of any required notice and the expiration of any cure period expressly granted to such Subsidiary Borrower in this Agreement or any other Loan Document evidencing any Guaranteed Obligation) any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, upon mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, Kimco hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lender Parties, in cash the amount of such unpaid Guaranteed Obligation. Upon payment by Kimco of any sums as provided above, all rights of Kimco against the applicable Subsidiary Borrower or any other Person arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations. In addition, any indebtedness of any Subsidiary Borrower now or hereafter held by Kimco is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. If any amount shall erroneously be paid to Kimco on account of (i) such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right or (ii) any such indebtedness of any Subsidiary Borrower, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Lender Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent to be credited against the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.

SECTION 11.7 Reinstatement .

Kimco further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Lender Party upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Subsidiary Borrower or otherwise. Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of Kimco hereunder except the full performance and payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations.

SECTION 11.8 Information .

Kimco assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of the Subsidiary Borrowers’ financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the nature, scope and extent of the risks that Kimco assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any other Lender Party will have any duty to advise Kimco of information now or hereafter known to it or any of them regarding any of the foregoing.
