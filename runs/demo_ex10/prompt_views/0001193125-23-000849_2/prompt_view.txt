“
Benchmark Replacement Date

the calculation thereof) permanently or indefinitely ceases to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or

- in the case of
clause (3)
of the definition of “Benchmark Transition Event”, the first date on which
such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) has been determined and announced by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) to be no longer representative;

provided that such non-representativeness will be determined by reference to the most recent statement or publication referenced in such clause (3) and even if any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) continues to be provided on such date.

4

For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if the event giving rise to the Benchmark Replacement Date occurs on the same day as, but earlier than, the Reference Time in respect of any determination, the Benchmark Replacement Date will be deemed to have occurred prior to the Reference Time for such determination and (ii) the “Benchmark Replacement Date” will be deemed to have occurred in the case of clause (1) or (2) with respect to any Benchmark upon the occurrence of the applicable event or events set forth therein with respect to all then-current Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof). “ Benchmark Transition Event ” means, with respect to any Benchmark, the occurrence of one or more of the following events with respect to such then-current Benchmark:

- a public statement or publication of information by or on behalf of the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published
component used in the calculation thereof) announcing that such administrator has ceased or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof), permanently or indefinitely;
provided
that, at the time of
such statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof);

- a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or
the published component used in the calculation thereof), the Federal Reserve Board, the NYFRB, the CME Term SOFR Administrator, an insolvency official with jurisdiction over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), a resolution
authority with jurisdiction over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component) or a court or an entity with similar insolvency or resolution authority over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), in each case, which
states that the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component) has ceased or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) permanently or indefinitely;
provided
that, at the time of such
statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or

- a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or
the published component used in the calculation thereof) announcing that all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) are no longer, or as of a specified future date will no longer be, representative.

For the avoidance of doubt, a “Benchmark Transition Event” will be deemed to have occurred with respect to any Benchmark if a public statement or publication of information set forth above has occurred with respect to each then-current Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof).

“ Benchmark Unavailability Period ” means, with respect to any Benchmark, the period (if any) (x) beginning at the time that a Benchmark Replacement Date pursuant to clause (1) or (2) of that definition has occurred if, at such time, no Benchmark Replacement has replaced such then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with Section 3.03(b) and (y) ending at the time that a Benchmark Replacement has replaced such then-current Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any other Loan Document in accordance with Section 3.03(b) . “ Beneficial Ownership Regulation ” means 31 C.F.R. § 1010.230.

conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum. Each borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans or Daily Simple SOFR
Loans shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple and not less than the Borrowing Minimum. Each Loan Notice shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a borrowing of Loans, a conversion of
Loans from one Type to another, or a continuation of Term SOFR Loans, (ii) the requested date of the borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day and, in the case of a borrowing of Loans, shall be the

case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.

If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation of any Term SOFR Borrowing, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or continued as, Term SOFR Loans with an Interest Period of one month. Any such automatic continuation as Term SOFR Loans with an Interest Period of one month shall be effective for the next subsequent Interest Period as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Term SOFR Borrowing.

- The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for
Term SOFR Loans upon determination of such interest rate.

such Borrowing then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid and, if a Term SOFR Borrowing is to be prepaid, the Interest Period applicable thereto. The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender’s ratable share of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment, and
the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable, on the date specified in the applicable notice;
provided
that such notice of prepayment may state that such prepayment is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more
events specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of such prepayment) if any applicable condition is not satisfied. Any prepayment of a Loan shall be
accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid. Subject to
Section

All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by reference to the Prime Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed (including the first day, but excluding the last day). All other computations of interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (including the first day, but excluding the last day) (which results in more interest being paid than if computed on the basis of a

365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which such

24

Loan is made, and shall not accrue on any Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which such Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.10(a) , bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 2.09 Evidence of Debt . The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender to the Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans to the Borrower in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to a Note and endorse thereon the date, Type, amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. 2.10 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent ’ s

Clawback
.

(a)
General
. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff, it being understood that nothing in this
Section
2.10
shall affect the rights of the Borrower to withhold for Taxes as provided in

Section
3.01
. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the
applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in US Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its applicable share of
such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 4:00 p.m., New York City time, shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any
applicable interest shall continue to accrue until such day. Except as expressly provided herein, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day,
and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest.

- (i)
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative
Agent
. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the Funding Date that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of the applicable Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
Section
2.02
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.
In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made
by such Lender, the NYFRB Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable to the Loans comprising such Borrowing. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of
such

25

interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

(ii)
Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent
. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made
such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to
repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to
the Administrative Agent, at the NYFRB Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing.

A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this
subsection
(b)
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

(c)
Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent
. If any Lender makes
available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to the Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this
Article
II
, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent because the conditions precedent set forth in
Section
4.02
are not satisfied (or waived in accordance with
Section
11.01
), the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in
like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

(d)
Obligations of Lenders Several
. The obligations of
the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to
Section
11.04(c)
or
11.05
are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under

Section
11.04(c)
or
11.05
on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under
Section
11.04(c)
or
11.05
.

(e)
Funding
Source
. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any
particular place or manner.

2.11
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
.
If any Lender shall,
by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans
and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Loans;
provided
that:

26

- if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the
payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and

- the provisions of this
Section
2.11
shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made
by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, as amended from time to time) (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (y) any
payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates (as to which the provisions of this

Section
2.11
shall apply).

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively
do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a
direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

2.12
Extension of Maturity
Date
.

The Borrower may, by notice (delivered at least one Business Day prior to the Maturity Date then in effect (the “
Existing Maturity Date
”)) to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the
Lenders), elect to extend the Maturity Date to January 3, 2025 (the “
Extension
”);
provided
that the Extension shall be subject to the satisfaction, on and as of the Existing Maturity Date, of the conditions that
- the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a certificate, dated as of the Existing Maturity Date and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such extension
- the representations and warranties contained in
Article V
(other than
Sections 5.05(b)
and
5.06
) are true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent that such representations and warranties are already
qualified by materiality, in which case they shall be true and correct in all respects) on and as of the Existing Maturity Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they
are true and correct in all material respects (except to the extent that such representations and warranties are already qualified by materiality, in which case they shall be true and correct in all respects) as of such earlier date, and except that
for purposes of this
Section
2.12
, the representations and warranties contained in subsection (a) of
Section
5.05
shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements delivered (or otherwise
made available) pursuant to subsection (a) of
Section
6.01
(and, if any financial statements shall have been subsequently delivered pursuant to subsection (b) of
Section
6.01
, then also
to such financial statements so subsequently delivered), and (ii) no Default exists and (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received the Extension Fees for the account of each Lender payable pursuant to

Section 2.07(a) . 2.13 Defaulting Lenders .

Adjustments
. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of “Required
Lenders” and
Section
11.01
.

(b)
Defaulting Lender Cure
. If the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that
Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;
provided
that all amendments, waivers or modifications effected without such Lender’s consent in accordance with the provisions of
Section
11.01
and this

Section 2.13 while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender shall be binding on it; and provided further that

27

except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender. ARTICLE III

TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

3.01 Taxes .

(a)
Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes
. (i) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Administrative Agent)
require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, then the Administrative Agent or the Borrower shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the
information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to
subsection
(e)
below.

- If the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall
withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to
subsection
(e)
below, (B) the Administrative Agent
shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the
Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section
3.01
) the applicable
Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.

(iii)
If the Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as required by such Laws, shall
withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to
subsection
(e)
below, (B) the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to
the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of
Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this

Section 3.01 ) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.

(b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower
. Without limiting the provisions of
subsection
(a)
above, the
Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.

(c)
Tax Indemnifications
. (i) Without duplication of amounts paid in
Section
3.01(a)
, the Borrower
shall, and does hereby, indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified

28

Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 3.01 ) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority;

provided
that the Borrower shall not be obligated to make payment to any Recipient pursuant to this
Section
3.01(c)
in respect of penalties, interest and other liabilities attributable to any Indemnified Taxes if
- written demand therefor has not been made by such Recipient within 60 days from the date on which such Recipient received written notice of the imposition of Indemnified Taxes by the relevant Governmental Authority, but only to the extent
such penalties, interest and other similar liabilities are attributable to such failure or delay by the Recipient in making such written demand, (y) such penalties, interest and other liabilities have accrued after the Borrower had indemnified
or paid an additional amount due as of the date of such payment pursuant to this
Section
3.01
or (z) such penalties, interest and other liabilities are attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any
of the Recipients or their Affiliates. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a
Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender receives a written notice of Tax assessment from any Governmental Authority regarding any Tax in respect of which indemnification may be required pursuant
to this
Section
3.01(c)
, the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall notify the Borrower within 120 days following the receipt of such notice that such notice has been received;
provided
that the failure of the
Administrative Agent or the Lender to provide such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of the obligation to make any indemnification payment under this Agreement, unless the delay is more than two years from the date of receipt of such notice, in
which case the Borrower shall have no obligation to make any indemnification payment under this Agreement. The Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand
therefor, for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to
Section
3.01(c)(ii)
below.

- Each Lender shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after
demand therefor, (w) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without
limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (x) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of

Section 11.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, (y) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Taxes incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent or the Borrower by any Governmental Authority as a result of the failure by such Lender to deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any documentation required to be delivered pursuant to

subsection (e) and (z) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower in connection with any Loan Document, and any related losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii) .

29

(d)
Evidence of Payments

As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by
the Borrower or by the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this
Section
3.01
, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as
the case may be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be (it being understood that any failure of the Administrative Agent to so notify shall not relieve the Borrower of its indemnification obligations hereunder).

(e)
Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation
. (i) Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time
or times prescribed by applicable Laws or when reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or the taxing authorities of a jurisdiction pursuant to
such applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not
such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such
documentation either (A) set forth in
Section
3.01(e)(ii)(A)
,
(ii)(B)
and
(ii)(D)
below or (B) required by applicable law other than the Code or the taxing authorities of the jurisdiction pursuant to
such applicable law to comply with the requirements for exemption or reduction of withholding tax in that jurisdiction) shall not be required if in the applicable Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would
subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

- Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax and the Administrative Agent shall deliver, on or prior to the Closing Date and from time to time upon the reasonable request of the Borrower, a properly completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-9; provided that if the Administrative Agent fails to provide such IRS Form W-9 upon request of the Borrower, the Borrower’s sole remedy shall be to withhold to the extent required by the applicable United States Treasury Regulations and, in such case, any such withheld Taxes shall be Excluded Taxes;

- any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate
”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form
W-8BEN
or IRS Form
W-8BEN-E,
as applicable; or

- to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form

W-8IMY, accompanied by copies of IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-2 or Exhibit D-3 , IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;

- any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary
documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and

- if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if
such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code)
and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has
complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.

31

- Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously
delivered pursuant to this
Section
3.01
expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its
legal inability to do so.

(f)
Treatment of Certain Refunds
. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the
Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If any Recipient
determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this

Section 3.01 , it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 3.01

with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. (g)

Contesting Indemnified Taxes . If the Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable basis exists for contesting any Indemnified Taxes for which additional amounts have been paid or are due under this

Section
3.01
, the Administrative Agent or Lender (as applicable) shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower in challenging such Indemnified Taxes, at the Borrower’s expense, if so requested by the
Borrower in writing;
provided
that nothing in this
Section
3.01(g)
shall obligate the Administrative Agent or any Lender to take any action that, in its reasonable judgment, would be materially disadvantageous to
such Person.

(h)
Survival
. Each party’s obligations under this
Section
3.01
shall survive the
resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

3.02 Illegality . If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Relevant Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Relevant Rate, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term SOFR Loans or Daily Simple SOFR Loans, as applicable, or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans or Daily Simple SOFR Loans, shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on such Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case, until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), convert all Term SOFR Loans or Daily Simple SOFR Loans, as applicable,

32

of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans and in the case of Daily Simple SOFR Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.

3.03
Alternate Rate

of Interest
.
- Subject to the provisions of

Section
3.03(b)
, if:


- the Administrative Agent reasonably determines (which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) (A) prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term SOFR Borrowing, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Adjusted Term SOFR (including because
the Term SOFR Reference Rate is not available or published on a current basis) for such Interest Period or (B) at any time, that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR; or

- the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders

that such Lenders have reasonably determined
- prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Term SOFR Borrowing, that the Adjusted Term SOFR for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included
in such Borrowing or (B) at any time, that the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Daily Simple SOFR Loans;

then the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Upon receipt of such notice and until the Administrative Agent (upon the
instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice with respect to the relevant Benchmark, (A) any Loan Notice that requests the making of, conversion to, or continuation of an affected Term SOFR Borrowing shall be ineffective,
- any request for the making of, conversion to or continuation of an affected Term SOFR Borrowing shall instead be deemed to be a request for the making of, or conversion to, as applicable, (x) a Daily Simple SOFR Borrowing so long as
the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not also the subject of
clause (i)
or
(ii)
above, or (y) a Base Rate Borrowing if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is also the subject of
clause (i)
or
(ii)
above,
- if any affected Term SOFR Loan is outstanding on the day of the Borrower’s receipt of such notice from the Administrative Agent with respect to the Term SOFR applicable to such Term SOFR Loan, then such affected Term SOFR Loans shall
automatically, on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, unless prepaid, convert to, and shall constitute, (x) a Daily Simple SOFR Borrowing so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not also the subject of

clause (i)
or
(ii)
above or (y) a Base Rate Borrowing if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is also the subject of
clause (i)
or
(ii)
above and (D) if any affected Daily Simple SOFR Loan is outstanding on
the day of the Borrower’s receipt of such notice form the Administrative Agent with respect to Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR, then such affected Daily Simple SOFR Loan shall, unless prepaid, automatically convert to, and shall constitute,
- a Term SOFR Loan with an Interest Period of one month so long as Adjusted Term SOFR is not also subject to
clause (i)
or
(ii)
above or (y) a Base Rate Borrowing if Adjusted Term SOFR is also the subject of
clause
(i)
or
(ii)
above.

- (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a
Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with

clause (1) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any other Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and

33

subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is
determined in accordance with
clause (2)
of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any other
Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders and the Borrower without any amendment to, or
further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the
Required Lenders.

- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative
Agent will have the right to make, with the consent of the Borrower, Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such
Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

- The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (A) any occurrence of a Benchmark
Transition Event, (B) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (C) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, (D) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to
clause
(b)(iv)
below and (E) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower or the Lenders pursuant to this

Section 3.03(b) , including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 3.03(b) . (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (A) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR) and either (x) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion or (y) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (B) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (A) above either (x) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (y) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.

- Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may
revoke any request for the borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of any Term SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark

34

Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any request for the making of, conversion to or continuation of any Term SOFR Borrowing into a request for the making of, or conversion to, as applicable, (x) a Daily Simple SOFR Borrowing so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) a Base Rate Borrowing if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event. Furthermore, if any Term SOFR Loan is outstanding on the date of the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to the Term SOFR, then until such time as a Benchmark Replacement is implemented pursuant to this Section 3.03(b) , such Term SOFR Loans shall on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, unless prepaid, convert to, and shall constitute, (x) a Daily Simple SOFR Borrowing so long as the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is not the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event or (y) a Base Rate Borrowing if the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR is the subject of a Benchmark Transition Event. 3.04 Increased Costs .

thereof.

35

(d)
Delay in Requests
. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand
compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this

provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section
3.04
for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 120 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change

a result of:

- any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Term SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

Borrower pursuant to
Section
11.13
;

including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds
obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.

calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this
Section
3.05
, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Term SOFR Loan made by it at the Adjusted Term SOFR for such Loan by a matching deposit or
other borrowing in the relevant interbank market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Term SOFR Loan was in fact so funded.

3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders .

(a)
Designation of a Different Lending Office
. Each Lender may make any Loan through any Lending Office;

Section
3.04
, or the Borrower is
required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section
3.01
, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to

Section 3.02 , then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04 , as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02 , as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

36

(b)
Replacement of Lenders
. If any Lender requests compensation under

Section 3.04 , or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01

ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

9.01 Appointment and Authority . Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC to act as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this Article (other than the Borrower’s consent rights in Section 9.06 ) are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and, except for such consent rights, the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.

9.02 Rights as a Lender . The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders. 9.03 Exculpatory Provisions . The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:

- shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

- shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for
herein or in the other Loan Documents),
provided
that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary
to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a
Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and

48

- shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have
any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its
Affiliates in any capacity.

The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the
consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in

Sections 8.02 and 11.01 ) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice (stating that it is a “notice of default”) describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.

The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the sufficiency, validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the Administrative Agent’s reliance on any Electronic Signature transmitted by emailed pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page), (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items (which on their face purport to be such items) expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent or (vi) any determination that any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or the effective date of such status.

9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent . The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

9.05 Delegation of Duties . The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.

9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent .

- The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice
of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the written consent of the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United
States, and which shall be a U.S. Person. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or
such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “
Resignation Effective Date
”), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders, appoint, with the written consent
of the Borrower, a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.

- If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
clause (d)
of the definition thereof,
the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with the written consent of the Borrower, appoint a successor, which successor
shall be a U.S. Person. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “
Removal
Effective Date
”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.

- With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) except for any expense reimbursement or indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed
Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor Administrative Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of
the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than as provided in
Section
3.01(c)
and other than any rights to expense reimbursement or indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed
Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this
Section
9.06
). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless
otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring or removed Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and

Section 11.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.

clause (a)
or

provided
that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within 10 Business Days after having received notice
thereof).

subsection (b)( i )(B) of this Section 11.06 and, in addition:

No Assignment to Certain Persons
. No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or

clause
(B)
, or
- to a natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural person).

59

(vi)
Certain Additional Payments
. In connection with any assignment
of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to
the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate to pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and
interest accrued thereon). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this
paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this

Section 11.06 , from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of

Sections 3.01 , 3.04 , 3.05 , and 11.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment); provided that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section 11.06 .

(c)
Register
. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a
non-fiduciary
agent
of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the
Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “
Register
”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent
manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(d)

Participations . Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural person), a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) (each, a “ Participant ”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other

60

parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under
Section
11.04(c)
without regard to the existence of any
participation.

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall
retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will
not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section
11.01
that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections
3.01
,
3.04
and
3.05
to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
subsection
(b)
of
this
Section
11.06
(it being understood that the documentation required under
Section
3.01(e)
shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation);
provided
that such Participant
- agrees to be subject to the provisions of
Sections
3.06
and
11.13

subsection
(b)
of this
Section
11.06
and (B) shall
not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section
3.01
or
3.04
, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from which it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive.
Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of
Section
3.06
with respect to any
Participant. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting as a
non-fiduciary
agent, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated
interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “
Participant Register
”);
provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the
Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the
extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under
Section 5f.103-1(c)
of the United States Treasury
Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this
Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

(e)
Certain Pledges
. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

11.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality . Subject to the last sentence of this Section 11.07 , each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to those of its Affiliates and its and their Related Parties that the Administrative Agent or any such Lender reasonably determines needs to know such Information (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.07 ), (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority that has or claims to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable Laws or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party

61

hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantively the same as (or more restrictive than) those of this
Section

Subsidiary. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (x) nothing contained in this
Section
11.07
shall supersede any nondisclosure or confidentiality provision contained in any nondisclosure
agreement, confidentiality agreement or other similar agreement (any such agreement, a “
Nondisclosure Agreement
”) entered into between the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Lender or any of its Affiliates,
on the other, to the extent otherwise applicable to any Information; it being understood and agreed that in the event of any conflict between the provisions of this
Section
11.07
and the nondisclosure or confidentiality
provisions contained in any Nondisclosure Agreement as it relates to any Information, the nondisclosure or confidentiality provision contained in such Nondisclosure Agreement shall govern; and (y) whether or not any Loan Document constitutes
Information, the Loan Documents (other than the Fee Letter) can be shared on a confidential basis with (i) any actual or prospective assignee or Participant hereunder, (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any
swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder, (iii) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries

Right of
Setoff

apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency, but excluding deposits in (i) trust or other fiduciary accounts (to the extent of amounts held therein in trust in the ordinary course
of business on behalf of third parties that are not the Borrower or its Subsidiaries), (ii) payroll accounts, (iii) health-savings accounts and worker’s compensation accounts, (iv) withholding tax accounts and (v) zero

the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or its Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such obligations of the Borrower are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of
such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness;
provided
that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off
shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of
Section
2.13
and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other
funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to
such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this
Section
11.08
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
that such Lender or Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application;

11.09 Interest Rate Limitation .

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the “ Maximum Rate ”). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

11.10 Counterparts; Entire Agreement; Effectiveness . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof (OTHER THAN ANY NONDISCLOSURE OR CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN ANY NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE TO THE INFORMATION (AS DEFINED HEREIN)) and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof (but do not supersede any provisions of any engagement letter or any fee letter that by the terms of such documents survive the effectiveness of this Agreement, all of which provisions shall remain in full force and effect). There are no unwritten oral agreements among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01 , this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including without limitation, Assignment and Assumptions, amendments or other modifications, Loan Notices, waivers and consents) (each, an “ Ancillary Document ”) that is an Electronic Signature transmitted by emailed .pdf or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. 11.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties . All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Borrowing, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied.

11.12 Severability . If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions

63

with valid provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.12 , if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.

11.13
Replacement of Lenders
.
If the Borrower is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to
the provisions of
Section
3.06
, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a
Non-Consenting
Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender
and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,
Section
11.06
), all of its interests,
rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to
Sections
3.01
and
3.04
) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations
(which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment),
provided
that:

- the Borrower shall have paid to
the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in
Section
11.06(b)(iv)
;

- such Lender shall
have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under

Section 3.05 ) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);

- in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section
3.04
or payments
required to be made pursuant to
Section
3.01
, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter;

- such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and

- in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a
Non-Consenting
Lender, the
applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
