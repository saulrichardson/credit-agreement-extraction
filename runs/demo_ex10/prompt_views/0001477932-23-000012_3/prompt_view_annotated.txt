[[A0017]]
At such time as the Board receives such notification, the Board may require the resignation of the Director if it determines that such business activity does in fact materially interfere with the performance of the Director's duties, services and responsibilities hereunder.

[[A0018]]
- Since the Director is to be classified as an independent director at the time of his appointment, the Director shall promptly inform the Board of any circumstances that would likely affect such independent status.

[[A0019]]
The Director shall inform the Board within 10 business days of the Director's appointment of any held (indirect and indirect) personal interests which may conflict with the Company and its business.

[[A0020]]
