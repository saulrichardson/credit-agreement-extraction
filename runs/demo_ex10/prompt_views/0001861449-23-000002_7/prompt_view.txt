(b) The execution, delivery and performance by each Guarantor of its obligations under this Guarantee will not (i) violate or conflict with (x) any provision of law, order, judgment, or decree of any court or other agency or government, (y) any provision of its constitutional documents, or (z) any agreement or other instrument to which such Guarantor is a party or is bound; (ii) result in a breach of, or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any contractual provision to which it is bound; or (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any of the property or assets of such Guarantor pursuant to any indenture, agreement or instrument (other than pursuant to this Guarantee), except in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) to the extent that any such conflict, breach, default, lien, charge, encumbrance, or violation as applicable, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. (c) Except where the failure to obtain or make such consent, approval or authorization could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, all consents, approvals, or authorizations from any Governmental Authority that are required to be obtained in connection with or as a condition to the execution, delivery or performance of this Guarantee have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect.

5 CAN_DMS: \149683496\4 (d) Each Guarantor is Solvent.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guarantee or any other Note Document, the representations contained in this Section 8 shall be continuing and remain in full force and effect until payment or conversion in full of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than inchoate indemnity obligations). 9. Subrogation. Each Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the Beneficiaries against the Issuer and the other Note Parties in respect of any amounts paid or deliveries made by such Guarantor pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee, provided, however, that the Guarantors shall not be entitled to enforce, or to receive any payments arising out of or based upon, such right of subrogation until indefeasible and final payment in full of all of the Guaranteed Obligations. 10. Expenses of Enforcement. The Guarantors further agree to pay, on a joint and several basis, all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, which are incurred by any of the Beneficiaries in any effort to collect or enforce any provision of this Guarantee. 11. Set-Off. Upon the Guaranteed Obligations becoming due and payable (by acceleration or otherwise) under the Note Purchase Agreement or any other applicable Note Document, each Beneficiary is hereby authorized to setoff, appropriate and apply (without presentment, demand, protest or other notice which are hereby expressly waived) any deposits and any other indebtedness held or owing by such Beneficiary (including by any branches or agencies of such Beneficiary) to, or for the account of, any Guarantor against amounts owing by such Guarantor hereunder (even if contingent or unmatured); provided, that such Beneficiary shall notify such Guarantor promptly following such setoff. 12. Interest Act (Canada). Each Guarantor acknowledges that certain of the rates of interest applicable to the Guaranteed Obligations may be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days or 365 days, as the case may be and paid for the actual number of days elapsed. For purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), whenever any interest is calculated using a rate based on a year of 360 days or 365 days, as the case may be, such rate determined pursuant to such calculation, when expressed as an annual rate is equivalent to (a) the applicable rate based on a year of 360 days or 365 days, as the case may be, (b) multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the period for such interest is payable (or compounded) ends, and (c) divided by 360 or 365, as the case may be. 13. Severability. If any provision of this Guarantee is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable that provision will be severed from this Guarantee and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect, without limitation.

Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER (WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS GUARANTEE OR ANY OTHER NOTE DOCUMENT. 16. Judgment Currency. (a) If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other amount due to the relevant Beneficiaries in respect of a Guarantor’s obligations under this Guarantee in any currency (the “Original Currency”) into another currency (the “Other Currency”), such Guarantor, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, agrees that the rate of exchange used will be that at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures, the relevant Beneficiary could purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is paid or satisfied. (b) The obligations of a Guarantor in respect of any sum due in the Original Currency from it to any of the Beneficiaries will, notwithstanding any judgment in any Other Currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the relevant Beneficiaries of any sum adjudged to be so due in such Other Currency the relevant Beneficiaries may, in accordance with their normal banking procedures, purchase the Original Currency with such Other Currency.

The Beneficiaries may, concurrently with any assignment of their rights and obligations in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement, assign this Guarantee or any rights or powers hereunder, with any or all of the underlying liabilities or obligations, the payment of which is guaranteed hereunder, in each case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Note Purchase Agreement. 18. Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Guarantee, together with the other Note Documents to which each Guarantor is a party, supersedes any prior negotiations, discussions, or communications between the Beneficiaries and the Guarantors or any of them and constitutes the entire agreement between the Beneficiaries and the Guarantors with respect to the Note Purchase Agreement and this Guarantee.
