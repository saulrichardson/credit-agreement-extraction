the Maturity Date). Unless otherwise directed by the Issuing Bank, Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to
the Issuing Bank for any such extension. Once an Evergreen Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have

to a date that is no more than one year from the then-current expiry date) or (B) it has received notice (which may be in writing

Date from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (ii) be obligated to
