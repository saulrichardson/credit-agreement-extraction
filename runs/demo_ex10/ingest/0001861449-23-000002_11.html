Each Investor,  and Founder Stockholder agrees to promptly notify the Company of any change in its email  address, and that failure to do so shall not affect the foregoing.  6.7 Consent Required to Amend, Modify, Terminate or Waive. This  Agreement may be amended, modified or terminated (other than pursuant to Section 7) and  the observance of any term hereof may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance  and either retroactively or prospectively) only by a written instrument executed by (a) the  Company; (b) the Founder Stockholders holding a majority of the Shares then held by the  Founder Stockholders who are then providing services to the Company as officers,  employees or consultants; and (c) the Investor Majority. Notwithstanding the foregoing:  (a) this Agreement may not be amended, modified or terminated and  the observance of any term of this Agreement may not be waived with respect to any Investor or  Founder Stockholder without the written consent of such Investor or Founder Stockholder unless  such amendment, modification, termination or waiver applies to all Investors or Founder  Stockholders, as the case may be, in the same fashion;   (b) the consent of the Founder Stockholders shall not be required for  any amendment, modification, termination or waiver if such amendment, modification,  termination, or waiver either (A) is not directly applicable to the rights of the Founder Stockholders  hereunder; or (B) does not adversely affect the rights of the Founder Stockholders in a manner that  is different than the effect on the rights of the other parties hereto; and  (c) any provision hereof may be waived by the waiving party on such  party&#8217;s own behalf, without the consent of any other party.   The Company shall give prompt written notice of any amendment, modification, termination, or  waiver hereunder to any party that did not consent in writing thereto. Any amendment,  modification, termination, or waiver effected in accordance with this Subsection 6.7 shall be  binding on each party and all of such party&#8217;s successors and permitted assigns, whether or not any  such party, successor or assignee entered into or approved such amendment, modification,  termination or waiver. For purposes of this Subsection 6.7, the requirement of a written instrument  may be satisfied in the form of an action by written consent of the Stockholders circulated by the  Company and executed by the Stockholder parties specified, whether or not such action by written  consent makes explicit reference to the terms of this Agreement.   6.8 Delays or Omissions. No delay or omission to exercise any right,  power or remedy accruing to any party under this Agreement, upon any breach or default  of any other party under this Agreement, shall impair any such right, power or remedy of  such non-breaching or non-defaulting party nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any  such breach or default, or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach or default  thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver  of any other breach or default previously or thereafter occurring.
