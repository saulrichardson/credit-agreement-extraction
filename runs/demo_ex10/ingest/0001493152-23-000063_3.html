<U>Conversion Right.</U> The Holder shall have the right, on any calendar day, at any time on or following the earlier of (i) the date
that an Event of Default (as defined in this Note) occurs under this Note or (ii) the date that the Company consummates an Uplist Offering
(as defined in this Note), to convert all or any portion of the then outstanding and unpaid Principal Amount and interest (including
any Default Interest) into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any
shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified,
at the Conversion Price (as defined below) determined as provided herein (a &ldquo;Conversion&rdquo;); <I>provided, however</I>, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the a Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note,
pursuant to Section 1 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance after conversion as set forth on the applicable
Notice of Conversion, the Holder (together with the Holder&rsquo;s affiliates (the &ldquo;Affiliates&rdquo;), and any other Persons (as
defined below) acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder&rsquo;s Affiliates (such Persons, &ldquo;Attribution Parties&rdquo;)),
would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the
number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares
of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted portion of this Note beneficially owned by
the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion
of any other securities of the Company subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein
beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for
purposes of this Section 1.1, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Holder that the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required
to be filed in accordance therewith. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in
accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section
1.1, in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock as reflected in (A) the Company&rsquo;s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B)
a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading
Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including
this Note, by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock was reported. The &ldquo;Beneficial Ownership Limitation&rdquo; shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding
at the time of the respective calculation hereunder. &ldquo;Person&rdquo; and &ldquo;Persons&rdquo; means an individual, a limited liability
company, a partnership, a joint venture, a corporation, a trust, an unincorporated organization, any other entity and any governmental
entity or any department or agency thereof. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Note.
The number of Conversion Shares to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount
(as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached
hereto as <U>Exhibit A</U> (the &ldquo;Notice of Conversion&rdquo;), delivered to the Borrower or Borrower&rsquo;s transfer agent by
the Holder in accordance with Section 1.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other
means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower or Borrower&rsquo;s transfer agent before 11:59 p.m.,
New York, New York time on such conversion date (the &ldquo;Conversion Date&rdquo;). The term &ldquo;Conversion Amount&rdquo; means,
with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the Principal Amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion <U>plus
</U>(2) at the Holder&rsquo;s option, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Principal Amount at the Interest Rate to the Conversion
Date, <U>plus</U> (3) at the Holder&rsquo;s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding
clauses (1) and/or (2).</FONT></P>

of Conversion Price.</U> The per share conversion price into which Principal Amount and interest (including any Default Interest) under
this Note shall be convertible into shares of Common Stock hereunder (the &ldquo;Conversion Price&rdquo;) shall equal $0.025, provided,
however, that if the Company consummates an Uplist Offering (as defined in this Note) on or before the date that is one hundred eighty
(180) calendar days after the Issue Date, then the Conversion Price shall equal 75% of the offering price per share of Common Stock (or
unit, if units are offered in the Uplist Offering) at which the Uplist Offering is made (the &ldquo;Uplist Conversion Price&rdquo;) (for
the avoidance of doubt, if a unit includes more than one share of the Common Stock in the Uplist Offering, the Uplist Conversion Price
shall mean 75% of the unit price divided by the number of shares of Common Stock contained in a unit), subject to adjustment as provided
in this Note. For the avoidance of doubt, if (i) an Event of Default occurs, (ii) the Company has not consummated the Uplist Offering,
and (iii) the date of the respective conversion under the Note is on or before the date that is one hundred eighty (180) calendar days
after the Issue Date, then the Conversion Price shall equal $0.025 per share (subject to adjustment as provided in this Note). &ldquo;Uplist
Offering&rdquo; shall mean an offering of Common Stock (or units consisting of Common Stock and warrants to purchase Common Stock) that
will result in the immediate listing for trading of the Common Stock on the NYSE American, the Nasdaq Capital Market, the Nasdaq Global
Market, the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the New York Stock Exchange, or any other national securities exchange (or any successors to
any of the foregoing). If at any time the Conversion Price as determined hereunder for any conversion would be less than the par value
of the Common Stock, then at the sole discretion of the Holder, the Conversion price hereunder may equal such par value for such conversion
and the Conversion Amount for such conversion may be increased to include Additional Principal, where &ldquo;Additional Principal&rdquo;
means such additional amount to be added to the Conversion Amount to the extent necessary to cause the number of conversion shares issuable
upon such conversion to equal the same number of conversion shares as would have been issued had the Conversion Price not been adjusted
by the Holder to the par value price. Holder shall be entitled to deduct $1,750.00 from the conversion amount in each Notice of Conversion
to cover Holder&rsquo;s fees associated with such conversion for up to three (3) Notices of Conversion. All such Conversion Price determinations
are to be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, rights offerings, reclassification or similar
transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the Common Stock. If the Company, at any time while this Note is outstanding:
(i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock
or any Common Stock Equivalents, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including
by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues, in the event of a
reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Company, then the Conversion Price shall be multiplied
by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) outstanding
immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after
such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall become effective immediately after the record date
for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after
the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. &ldquo;Common Stock Equivalents&rdquo; means any securities
of the Company or the Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries which would entitle the holder thereof to acquire at any time Common Stock, including,
without limitation, any debt, preferred stock, right, option, warrant or other instrument that is at any time convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for, or otherwise entitles the holder thereof to receive, Common Stock.</FONT></P>

the Company could have issued such Conversion Shares to the Holder without violating this Section 1.4(d); and (ii) the Holder, upon written
notice to the Company, may void all or any portion of such Notice of Conversion; provided that the voiding of all or any portion of a

otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise
that the Holder anticipated receiving from the Company, then the Company shall, within two (2) Trading Days after the Holder&rsquo;s
request and in the Holder&rsquo;s discretion, either (i) pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the Holder&rsquo;s total purchase
price (including brokerage commissions and other reasonable and customary out-of-pocket expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock
so purchased (the &ldquo;Buy-In Price&rdquo;), at which point the Company&rsquo;s obligation to deliver such certificate (and to issue
such Conversion Shares) or credit such Holder&rsquo;s balance account with DTC for such Conversion Shares shall terminate, or (ii) promptly
honor its obligation to deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing such Conversion Shares or credit such Holder&rsquo;s
balance account with DTC and pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product of
(A) such number of shares of Common Stock, times (B) the closing sales price of the Common Stock on the date of exercise. Nothing shall
limit the Holder&rsquo;s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation,
a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company&rsquo;s failure to timely deliver certificates
representing the Conversion Shares (or to electronically deliver such Conversion Shares) upon the conversion of this Note as required

due hereunder are outstanding, issues, sells or grants (or has issued, sold or granted as of the Issue Date, as the case may be) any
option to purchase, or sells or grants any right to reprice, or otherwise disposes of, or issues (or has sold or issued, as the case

any convertible notes or warrants outstanding as of or following the Issue Date), in each or any case at an effective price per share
that is lower than the then Conversion Price (such lower price, the &ldquo;Base Conversion Price&rdquo; and such issuances, collectively,
a &ldquo;Dilutive Issuance&rdquo;) (it being agreed that if the holder of the Common Stock or other securities so issued shall at any
time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise,
or due to warrants, options or rights per share which are issued in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common
Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the Conversion Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less
than the Conversion Price on such date of the Dilutive Issuance), then the Conversion Price shall be reduced, at the option of the Holder,
to a price equal to the Base Conversion Price. Except with respect to an Exempt Issuance, such adjustment shall be made whenever such
Common Stock or other securities are issued. By way of example, and for the avoidance of doubt, if the Company issues a convertible promissory
note (including but not limited to a Variable Rate Transaction [not allowed]) after the date hereof, and the holder of such convertible
promissory note has the right to convert it into Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the then Conversion
Price (including but not limited to a conversion price with a discount that varies with the trading prices of or quotations for the Common
Stock), then the Holder has the right to reduce the Conversion Price to such Base Conversion Price (including but not limited to a conversion
price with a discount that varies with the trading prices of or quotations for the Common Stock) at any time while this Note or any amounts
due hereunder are outstanding, regardless of whether the holder of such convertible promissory note ever effectuated a conversion at
the Base Conversion Price. In the event of an issuance of securities involving multiple tranches or closings, any adjustment pursuant
to this Section 1.6(e) shall be calculated as if all such securities were issued at the initial closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Holder may only enforce its rights under this Section 1.6(e) after the date that is one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after
the Issue Date, provided, however, that at such time the Holder may enforce its rights to all adjustments hereunder that apply even if
the Dilutive Issuance occurred on or prior to the date that is one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the Issue Date. &ldquo;Exempt
Issuance&rdquo; shall mean the issuance of Common Stock to Megawell USA Technology Investment Fund I LLC (&ldquo;Megawell&rdquo;), pursuant
to that certain credit agreement and promissory note dated December 31, 2016, so long as (i) Calvin Pang remains both the managing director
of Megawell and the chief financial officer of the Company and (ii) Megawell&rsquo;s sale of the Common Stock is subject to the restrictions
on affiliates provided for in Rule 144(e).</FONT></P>
