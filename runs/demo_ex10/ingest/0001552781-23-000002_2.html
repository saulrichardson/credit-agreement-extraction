</FONT><U>Confidential Information</U>. During Executive&rsquo;s employment, the Company will continue to provide Executive with access
to Confidential Information (as defined below). Executive acknowledges that Confidential Information is the sole and exclusive property
of the Company Group. Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executive occupies a position of trust and confidence with respect to the
Company Group&rsquo;s affairs and business and the Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the interests afforded
protection by this Agreement are the Company Group&rsquo;s legitimate business interests, deserving of legal protection. Executive agrees
to take the following steps to preserve the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information: (i) during and after
Executive&rsquo;s employment with the Company Group, Executive will not use, or permit others to use, misappropriate or disclose any Confidential
Information, directly or indirectly, to any other person, or use Confidential Information in any way without the prior written consent
of an authorized executive officer of the Company (other than Executive); <U>provided</U> that Executive may use the Confidential Information
only for the Company&rsquo;s benefit and only in the course of Executive&rsquo;s employment with the Company; Executive further agrees
that the Confidential Information includes information or material received by the Company Group from other parties with the intention
that it be kept in confidence by its recipients; (ii)&nbsp;Executive shall use Executive&rsquo;s best efforts and take all reasonable
precautions to prevent inadvertent or accidental disclosure of Confidential Information to any third party, and Executive represents and
warrants that Executive has not disclosed and shall not disclose to the Company any trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary
information that may not lawfully be so disclosed by Executive, by virtue of the ownership of the same by another person or entity or
otherwise; (iii) Executive acknowledges and agrees that all Confidential Information, whether prepared by Executive (either alone or in
cooperation with others) or otherwise coming into Executive&rsquo;s possession, shall remain the exclusive property of the Company, and
Executive will not remove any Confidential Information from the Company&rsquo;s premises except for use in the Company&rsquo;s business.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information of the Company may be disclosed where required by law or order of a court of competent
jurisdiction; <U>provided</U> that, Executive first gives to the Company reasonable prior written notice of such disclosure and affords
the Company, to the extent reasonably practicable, the reasonable opportunity for the Company to obtain protective or similar orders,
where available. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if the Company waives compliance with the
terms hereof, Executive shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which, based on the advice of Executive&rsquo;s
legal counsel, is legally required to be disclosed and shall exercise reasonable efforts to provide that the receiving person shall agree
to treat such Confidential Information as confidential to the extent possible (and permitted under applicable law) in respect of the applicable
proceeding or process, and the Company shall be given an opportunity to review the Confidential Information prior to disclosure thereof.
Executive understands and acknowledges that Executive has the right under U.S. federal law to certain protections for cooperating with
or reporting legal violations to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;<U>SEC</U>&rdquo;) or its Office of the Whistleblower,
as well as certain other governmental entities. No provisions in this Agreement are intended to prohibit Executive from cooperating with
or reporting violations to, the SEC or any other such governmental entity, and Executive may do so without disclosure to the Company.
The Company may not retaliate against Executive for any of these activities. Further, nothing in this Agreement precludes Executive from
filing a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or a like charge or complaint with a state or local
fair employment practice agency. Furthermore, Executive acknowledges that pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Executive
may not be held liable under any criminal or civil federal or state trade secret law for disclosure of a trade secret (x) made in confidence
to a government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected
violation of law, (y) made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal
or (z) made to Executive&rsquo;s attorney or used in a court proceeding in an anti-retaliation lawsuit based on the reporting of a suspected
violation of law, so long as any document containing the trade secret is filed under seal and Executive does not disclose the trade secret
except pursuant to court order.</P>

</FONT><U>Reasonableness</U>. Executive acknowledges that the geographic boundaries, scope of prohibited activities, and time duration
of the covenants in this Section 4 are all reasonable in nature and no broader than are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests
of the Company Group, and Executive further acknowledges that any violation of these covenants would cause substantial irreparable injury
to the Company Group.</P>

</FONT><U>Blue Pencil</U>. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a court of competent jurisdiction shall at any time deem
the duration or the scope of any of the provisions of this Section 4 unenforceable, the other provisions of this Section 4 shall nevertheless
stand and the duration and scope set forth herein shall be deemed to be the longest period or greatest size permissible by law under the
circumstances, and the parties hereto agree that such court shall reduce the time period or scope to such permissible duration or size.</P>

</FONT><U>Certain Remedies</U>. Without intending to limit the remedies available to the Company Group, Executive agrees that a breach
of any of the covenants contained in this Section&nbsp;4 may result in material and irreparable injury to the Company Group for which
there is no adequate remedy at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event
of such a breach or threat thereof, any member of the Company Group shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining order or a preliminary
or permanent injunction, or both, without bond or other security, restraining Executive from engaging in activities prohibited by the
covenants contained in this Section&nbsp;4 or such other relief as may be required to specifically enforce any of the covenants contained
in this Agreement. Such injunctive relief in any court shall be available to the Company Group in lieu of, or prior to or pending determination
in, any arbitration proceeding. In addition to the remedies the Company may seek and obtain pursuant to this Section&nbsp;4(l), the Restricted
Period shall be extended by any and all periods during which Executive shall be found by a court or arbitrator possessing personal jurisdiction
over Executive to have been in violation of the covenants contained in this Section&nbsp;4.</P>

</FONT></FONT><B><U>Section 280G</U></B>. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement (or any plan, policy, agreement or
other arrangement covering Executive), if any payment, right or benefit paid, provided or due to Executive, whether pursuant to this Agreement
or otherwise (each, a &ldquo;<U>Payment</U>,&rdquo; and collectively, the &ldquo;<U>Total Payments</U>&rdquo;), would subject Executive
to the excise tax imposed by Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code (the &ldquo;<U>Excise Tax</U>&rdquo;), then the Total Payments will be reduced
to the minimum extent necessary to avoid the imposition of the Excise Tax, but only if (i) the amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced,
is greater than or equal to (ii) the amount of such Total Payments without reduction (in each case, determined on an after-tax basis).
Any reduction of the Total Payments required by this &lrm;paragraph will be implemented by determining the Parachute Ratio (as defined
below) for each Payment and then by reducing the Payments in order, beginning with the Payment with the highest Parachute Ratio. For Payments
with the same Parachute Ratio, later Payments will be reduced before earlier Payments. For Payments with the same Parachute Ratio and
the same time of payment, each Payment will be reduced proportionately. For purposes of this paragraph, &ldquo;<U>Parachute Ratio</U>&rdquo;
means a fraction, (x) the numerator of which is the value of the applicable Payment, as calculated for purposes of Section 280G of the
Code, and (y) the denominator of which is the economic value of the applicable Payment.</P>
