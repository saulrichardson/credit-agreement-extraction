The EMEA Guarantor hereby agrees that  its obligations shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional and, without limiting the generality  of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by:  (a) any failure or delay to enforce the provisions of the Credit Agreement;   (b) the perfection, release or extent of any Collateral or EMEA Guarantor Collateral  or any failure to realize on any Collateral or EMEA Guarantor Collateral;  (c) any waiver, modification or consent to departure from, or amendment of the  Credit Agreement;  (d) the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Credit Agreement or the  Guaranteed Obligations;   (e) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Borrower or  the EMEA Guarantor; or   (f) any other circumstances (other than payment in full) which may otherwise  constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor.

The  Beneficiaries have no duty or responsibility whatsoever to the EMEA Guarantor and make no  representation or warranty in respect of the management and maintenance of the Guaranteed  Obligations or any collateral therefor.    3.
