Position. Subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall cause the Director to be appointed, and the Director hereby agrees to serve the Company in such position upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, provided, however, that the Director's continued service on the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") after the initial one- year term on the Board shall be subject to any necessary approval by the Company's stockholders. Director is classified as an Independent Director as defined by NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15) and also Section lOA of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 which specifies general criteria for independence.</p> <p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px 0px 0px 37.5pt; text-align:justify;">2. Duties.</p> <p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 1in; text-align:justify;">(a) During the Directorship Term (as defined herein), the Director make reasonable business efforts to attend all Board meetings and quarterly pre-scheduled Board and Committee meetings of the Board, and Management conference calls, serve on appropriate subcommittees as reasonably requested and agreed upon by the Board, make himself available to the Company at mutually convenient times and places, attend external meetings and presentations when agreed on in advance, as appropriate and convenient, and perform such duties, services and responsibilities, and have the authority commensurate to such position.</p> <p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 1in; text-align:justify;">(b) The Director will use his best efforts to promote the interests of the Company. The Company recognizes that the Director (i) is or may become a full-time executive employee of another entity and that his responsibilities to such entity must have priority and (ii) sits or may sit on the board of directors of other entities, subject to any limitations set forth by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and limitations provided by any exchange or quotation service on which the Company's common stock is listed or traded. Notwithstanding the same, the Director will provide the Company with prior written notice of any future commitments to such entities and use reasonable business efforts to coordinate his respective commitments so as to fulfill his obligations to the Company and, in any event, will fulfill his legal obligations as a Director. Other than as set forth above, the Director will not, without the prior notification to the Board, engage in any other business activity which could materially interfere with the performance of his duties, services and responsibilities hereunder or which is in violation of the reasonable policies established from time to time by the Company, provided that the foregoing shall in no way limit his activities on behalf of (i) any current employer and its affiliates or (ii) the board of directors of any entities on which he currently sits. At such time as the Board receives such notification, the Board may require the resignation of the Director if it determines that such business activity does in fact materially interfere with the performance of the Director's duties, services and responsibilities hereunder.</p> <p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 1in; text-align:justify;">(c) Since the Director is to be classified as an independent director at the time of his appointment, the Director shall promptly inform the Board of any circumstances that would likely affect such independent status. The Director shall inform the Board within 10 business days of the Director's appointment of any held (indirect and indirect) personal interests which may conflict with the Company and its business. The Director will at all times act as a fiduciary in the service and best interests of the Company. In addition, the Director agrees to (i) provide all information regarding himself or herself as the Company requires to satisfy its disclosure obligations under applicable securities laws; (ii) timely file with the Securities and Exchange Commission all reports and schedules required of the Director in his or her personal capacity by virtue of his or her relationship with the Company (e.g. Forms 3, 4 and 5 as contemplated by Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).</p> <p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin:0px"> <table style="border-spacing:0;font:10pt times new roman;width:100%" cellpadding="0"> <tr style="height:15px"> <td class="hpbhr">&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr style="height:15px"> <td style="BORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; TEXT-INDENT: 0px;text-align:center;">Page 1 of 4</td></tr> <tr style="height:15px"> <td><p style='page-break-after: always'></p></td></tr> <tr style="height:15px"> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr></table></p> <p style="margin:0px"></p> <p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p> <p style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman; MARGIN: 0px; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; text-align:justify;">3.
