at any time or times during the Exercise Period by delivery of a written notice, in the form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit A</U> (the

shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise (or deliver such shares of Common Stock in electronic
format if requested by the Holder). Upon delivery of the Exercise Delivery Documents, the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes
to have become the holder of record of the Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant has been exercised, irrespective of the
date of delivery of the certificates evidencing such Warrant Shares. If this Warrant is submitted in connection with any exercise and
the number of Warrant Shares represented by this Warrant submitted for exercise is greater than the number of Warrant Shares being acquired
upon an exercise, then the Company shall as soon as practicable and in no event later than three business days after any exercise and
at its own expense, issue a new Warrant (in accordance with Section 6) representing the right to purchase the number of Warrant Shares
purchasable immediately prior to such exercise under this Warrant, less the number of Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant
is exercised.</FONT></P>

respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon

any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above
shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes
of this Section 1(c), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company&rsquo;s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the
case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Company&rsquo;s
transfer agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company
shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any
case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities
of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number
of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The &ldquo;Beneficial Ownership Limitation&rdquo; shall be 4.99% of the number of
shares of the Common Stock outstanding at the time of the respective calculation hereunder. The limitations contained in this paragraph
shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.</FONT></P>

one (1) business day of Holder&rsquo;s request, the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder&rsquo;s total purchase price (including brokerage
commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the
Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving
rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent
number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to
the Holder within one (1) business day of Holder&rsquo;s request the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had
the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases, or effectuates
a cashless exercise hereunder for, Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted
exercise of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A)
of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written
notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount
of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder&rsquo;s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in
equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company&rsquo;s failure
to timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof.</FONT></P>

Exercise Price on such date of the Dilutive Issuance (regardless of whether the Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are (i) subsequently
redeemed or retired by the Company after the date of the Dilutive Issuance or (ii) actually converted or exercised at such Base Share

Equivalents are (i) subsequently redeemed or retired by the Company after the date of the Dilutive Issuance or (ii) actually converted
or exercised at such Base Share Price by the holder thereof (for the avoidance of doubt, the Holder may utilize the Base Share Price
even if the Company did not actually issue shares of its common stock at the Base Share Price under the respective Common stock Equivalents).
The Company shall notify the Holder in writing, no later than the Trading Day following the issuance of any Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalents subject to this Section 2(b), indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price,
conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice the &ldquo;Dilutive Issuance Notice&rdquo;). For purposes of clarification, regardless
of whether (i) the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section 2(b) upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance
or (ii) the Holder accurately refers to the Base Share Price in the Exercise Notice, the Holder is entitled to utilize the Base Share
Price at all times on and after the date of such Dilutive Issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holder may only enforce its rights
under this Section 2(b) after the date that is one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the Issuance Date, provided, however, that
at such time the Holder may enforce its rights to all adjustments under this Section 2(b) that apply even if the Dilutive Issuance occurred
prior to the date that is one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the Issuance Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment
shall occur under this Section 2(b) with respect to the Uplist Offering. &ldquo;Exempt Issuance&rdquo; shall mean the issuance of Common

note dated December 31, 2016, so long as (i) Calvin Pang remains both the managing director of Megawell and the chief financial officer
of the Company and (ii) Megawell&rsquo;s sale of the Common Stock is subject to the restrictions on affiliates provided for in Rule 144(e).</FONT></P>

recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Exercise
Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced and the number of Warrant Shares will be proportionately

under this Section 2(c) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

of shares of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event (disregarding any limitation on exercise
contained herein solely for the purpose of such determination). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise
Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable
in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the
Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration.
If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then
the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such
Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any Successor Entity in such Fundamental Transaction
shall issue to the Holder a new warrant consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder&rsquo;s right to exercise
