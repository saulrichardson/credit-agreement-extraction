Until all of Company&rsquo;s obligations under all of the Transaction Documents are paid and performed

(i) so long as Investor beneficially owns any of the Securities and for at least twenty (20) Trading Days (as defined in the Note) thereafter,
Company will timely file on the applicable deadline all reports required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Sections&nbsp;13 or 15(d)
of the 1934 Act, and will take all reasonable action under its control to ensure that adequate current public information with respect
to Company, as required in accordance with Rule 144 of the 1933 Act, is publicly available, and will not terminate its status as an issuer
required to file reports under the 1934 Act even if the 1934 Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would permit such termination;
(ii) when issued, the Conversion Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid for and non-assessable, free and clear of
all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances; (iii) the Class A Ordinary Shares shall be listed or quoted for trading on NYSE or Nasdaq;
(iv) trading in Company&rsquo;s Class A Ordinary Shares will not be suspended, halted, chilled, frozen, reach zero bid or otherwise cease
trading on Company&rsquo;s principal trading market; (v) Company will not make any Restricted Issuances (as defined below) without Investor&rsquo;s
prior written consent, which consent may be granted or withheld in Investor&rsquo;s sole and absolute discretion; and (vi) Company shall
not enter into any agreement or otherwise agree to any covenant, condition, or obligation that locks up, restricts in any way or otherwise
prohibits Company: (a) from entering into a variable rate transaction with Investor or any affiliate of Investor, or (b) from issuing
Class A Ordinary Shares, preferred shares, warrants, convertible notes, other debt securities, or any other Company securities to Investor
or any affiliate of Investor.&nbsp;For purposes hereof, the term &ldquo;<B>Restricted Issuance</B>&rdquo; means the issuance, incurrence
or guaranty of any debt obligations other than trade payables in the ordinary course of business, or the issuance of any securities that
(1) have or may have conversion rights of any kind, contingent, conditional or otherwise, in which the number of shares that may be issued
pursuant to such conversion right varies with the market price of the Class A Ordinary Shares, (2) are or may become convertible into
Class A Ordinary Shares (including without limitation convertible debt, warrants or convertible preferred shares), with a conversion price
that varies with the market price of the Class A Ordinary Shares, even if such security only becomes convertible following an event of
default, the passage of time, or another trigger event or condition; or (3) have a fixed conversion price, exercise price or exchange
price that is subject to being reset at some future date at any time after the initial issuance of such debt or equity security (A) due
to a change in the market price of Company&rsquo;s Common Stock since the date of the initial issuance or (B) upon the occurrence of specified
or contingent events directly or indirectly related to the business of Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the issuance of Class A Ordinary
Shares under, pursuant to, in exchange for or in connection with any contract or instrument, whether convertible or not, is deemed a Restricted
Issuance for purposes hereof if the number of Class A Ordinary Shares to be issued is based upon or related in any way to the market price
of the Class A Ordinary Shares, including, but not limited to, Class A Ordinary Shares issued in connection with a Section 3(a)(9) exchange,
a Section 3(a)(10) settlement, or any other similar settlement or exchange. For the further avoidance of doubt, Class A Ordinary Shares
issued pursuant to any of the following will not be considered Restricted Issuances: (i) ATM facilities; (ii) primary offerings without
variable price mechanics other than variable priced warrants that have no provisions that will increase the number of Class A Ordinary
Shares issued at closing or increase the numbers of Class A Ordinary Shares issuable under each warrant to a ratio of more than 1:1; (iii)
issuances to non-US persons; or (iv) issuances in conjunction with acquisitions provided that such issuances do not cause a change of
control or have variable price mechanisms.</P>

without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Utah or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Utah. Each party consents to and expressly agrees
that the exclusive venue for arbitration of any dispute arising out of or relating to any Transaction Document or the relationship of
the parties or their affiliates shall be in Salt Lake County, Utah. Without modifying the parties&rsquo; obligations to resolve disputes
hereunder pursuant to the Arbitration Provisions, for any litigation arising in connection with any of the Transaction Documents (and
notwithstanding the terms (specifically including any governing law and venue terms) of any transfer agent services agreement or other
agreement between the Transfer Agent and Company, such litigation specifically includes, without limitation any action between or involving
Company and the Transfer Agent under the TA Letter or otherwise related to Investor in any way (specifically including, without limitation,
any action where Company seeks to obtain an injunction, temporary restraining order, or otherwise prohibit the Transfer Agent from issuing
Class A Ordinary Shares to Investor for any reason)), each party hereto hereby (i) consents to and expressly submits to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Salt Lake County, Utah, (ii) expressly submits to the exclusive venue of
any such court for the purposes hereof, (iii) agrees to not bring any such action (specifically including, without limitation, any action

any claim of improper venue and any claim or objection that such courts are an inconvenient forum or any other claim, defense or objection
to the bringing of any such proceeding in such jurisdiction or to any claim that such venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper.
Finally, Company covenants and agrees to name Investor as a party in interest in, and provide written notice to Investor in accordance

any such action. Company acknowledges that the governing law and venue provisions set forth in this Section 11.2 are material terms to
induce Investor to enter into the Transaction Documents and that but for Company&rsquo;s agreements set forth in this Section 11.2 Investor
would not have entered into the Transaction Documents.</P>

</FONT><U>Specific Performance</U>. Company acknowledges and agrees that Investor may suffer irreparable harm in the event that Company

It is accordingly agreed that Investor shall be entitled to one or more injunctions to prevent or cure breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement or such other Transaction Document and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof or thereof, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which the Investor may be entitled under the Transaction Documents, at law or in equity. Company specifically agrees
that: (a) following an Event of Default (as defined in the Note) under the Note, Investor shall have the right to seek and receive injunctive
relief from a court or an arbitrator prohibiting Company from issuing any of its common or preferred stock to any party unless the Note
is being paid in full simultaneously with such issuance; and (b) following a breach of Section 4(vi) above, Investor shall have the right
to seek and receive injunctive relief from a court or arbitrator invalidating such lock-up. Company specifically acknowledges that Investor&rsquo;s
right to obtain specific performance constitutes bargained for leverage and that the loss of such leverage would result in irreparable
harm to Investor. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event Investor seeks to obtain an injunction from a court or an arbitrator against
Company or specific performance of any provision of any Transaction Document, such action shall not be a waiver of any right of Investor
under any Transaction Document, at law, or in equity, including without limitation its rights to arbitrate any Claim pursuant to the terms
of the Transaction Documents, nor shall Investor&rsquo;s pursuit of an injunction prevent Investor, under the doctrines of claim preclusion,
issues preclusion, res judicata or other similar legal doctrines, from pursuing other Claims in the future in a separate arbitration.</P>
