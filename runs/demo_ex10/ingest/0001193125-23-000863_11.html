Company seeks shareholder approval of a proposed Business Combination (as defined below), then in connection with such proposed Business Combination, it, he or she shall (i)&nbsp;vote any Shares owned by it, him or her in favor of any proposed
Business Combination and (ii)&nbsp;not redeem any Shares owned by it, him or her in connection with such shareholder approval. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">2. The

redeem 100% of the Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares sold as part of the Units in the Public Offering (the &#147;<B><I><U>Offering Shares</U></I></B>&#148;), at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the

all Public Shareholders&#146; rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii)&nbsp;as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the
approval of the Company&#146;s remaining shareholders and the Company&#146;s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company&#146;s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and other

closing of the Public Offering (extendable at the sponsor&#146;s option to up to 18 months, as described below in the Prospectus) or (b)&nbsp;with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders&#146; rights or

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Sponsor and each Insider acknowledges that it, he or she has no right, title, interest
or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account or any other asset of the Company as a result of any liquidation of the Company with respect to the Founder Shares (as defined below) held by it. The Sponsor and each Insider hereby
further waives, with respect to any Shares held by it, him or her, if any, any redemption rights it, he or she may have in connection with the consummation of a Business Combination, including, without limitation, any such rights available in the
context of a shareholder vote to approve such Business Combination or in the context of a tender offer made by the Company to purchase Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares (although the Sponsor and the Insiders shall be entitled to redemption and
liquidation rights with respect to any Offering Shares it or they hold if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination within 15 months from the date of the closing of the Public Offering (extendable at the sponsor&#146;s option to up to
18 months, as described below in the Prospectus) or such later period approved by the Company&#146;s shareholders in accordance with the Company&#146;s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">3. In the event of the liquidation of the Trust Account, the Sponsor (which for purposes of clarification shall not extend to any other
equityholders, members or managers of the Sponsor) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any and all legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, whether pending or threatened, or any claim whatsoever) to which the Company may become subject as a result of any claim by (i)&nbsp;any third party (other than the
Company&#146;s independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to the Company or (ii)&nbsp;a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement (a
&#147;<B><I><U>Target</U></I></B>&#148;); <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that such indemnification of the Company by the Sponsor shall apply only to the extent necessary to ensure that such claims by a third party for services rendered (other than
the Company&#146;s independent public accountants) or products sold to the Company or a Target do not reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.20 per share of the Offering Shares or (ii)&nbsp;such lesser amount per share of
the Offering Shares held in the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, in each case, net of the amount of interest earned on the property in the Trust Account which
may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party (including a Target) who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company&#146;s indemnity of the
Underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In the event that any such executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against such third party, the Sponsor shall not be responsible to
the extent of any liability for such third party claims. The Sponsor shall have the right to defend against any such claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Company if, within 15 days following written receipt of notice of
the claim to the Sponsor, the Sponsor notifies the Company in writing that it shall undertake such defense. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">4. To the extent that the
Underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 Units within 45 days from the date of the Prospectus (and as further described in the Prospectus), the Sponsor agrees that it shall forfeit, at no
cost, a number of Founder Shares in the aggregate equal to 375,000 multiplied by a fraction, (i)&nbsp;the numerator of which is 1,500,000 minus the number of Units purchased by the Underwriters upon the exercise of their over-allotment option, and
(ii)&nbsp;the denominator of which is 1,500,000. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All references in this Letter Agreement to Founder Shares of the Company being forfeited
shall take effect as surrenders for no consideration of such Founder Shares as a matter of Cayman Islands law. The forfeiture will be adjusted to the extent that the over-allotment option is not exercised in full by the Underwriters so that the
Founder Shares will represent 20.0% of the Company&#146;s issued and outstanding Shares after the Public Offering (assuming the Initial Shareholders do not purchase any units in the Public Offering and excluding the Representative Shares). The
Initial Shareholders further agree that to the extent that the size of the Public Offering is increased or decreased, the Company will effect a capitalization or share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable,
immediately prior to the consummation of the Public Offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of the Initial Shareholders prior to the Public Offering at 20.0% of the Company&#146;s issued and outstanding Shares upon the consummation of
the Public Offering (assuming the Initial Shareholders do not purchase any units in the Public Offering and excluding the Representative Shares). In connection with such increase or decrease in the size of the Public Offering, then (A)&nbsp;the
references to 1,500,000 in the numerator and denominator of the formula in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be changed to a number equal to 15% of the number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares included in the Units issued in the Public
Offering and (B)&nbsp;the reference to 375,000 in the formula set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall be adjusted to such number of Founder Shares that the Founder Shares would represent an aggregate of 20.0% of the Company&#146;s
issued and outstanding Shares after the Public Offering (assuming the Initial Shareholders do not purchase any units in the Public Offering and excluding the Representative Shares). </P>
