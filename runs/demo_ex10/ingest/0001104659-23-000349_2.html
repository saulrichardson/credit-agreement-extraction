award agreements documenting the RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan, (b)&nbsp;Article&nbsp;IV of the award agreements documenting the PSUs
granted under the 2017 Plan, and (c)&nbsp;Section&nbsp;7 of the award agreement documenting the RSUs and PSUs granted under the 2020 Plan,

by the non-competition covenants set forth in the award agreements documenting the RSUs and the PSUs are those activities relating to
pressure pumping, cementing and coil tubing in the oilfield services industry (the &ldquo;<B><I>Restricted Services</I></B>&rdquo;). For
the avoidance of doubt, Wilson&rsquo; involvement with any exploration and production company or other oilfield services company that
