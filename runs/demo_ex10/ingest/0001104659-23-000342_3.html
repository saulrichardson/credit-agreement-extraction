Balance for which Borrower has received a Conversion Notice (as defined below) from Lender where the applicable Conversion Shares have
not yet been delivered) of this Note, in part or in full, in accordance with this Section 1.2. Any notice of prepayment hereunder (an
 &ldquo;<B>Optional Prepayment Notice</B>&rdquo;) shall be delivered to Lender at its registered address or through email and shall state:
(i) that Borrower is exercising its right to prepay this Note, and (ii) the date of prepayment, which shall be not less than five (5)
Trading Days from the date of the Optional Prepayment Notice. On the date fixed for prepayment (the &ldquo;<B>Optional Prepayment Date</B>&rdquo;),
Borrower shall make payment of the Optional Prepayment Amount (as defined below) to or upon the order of Lender as may be specified by
Lender in writing to Borrower. For the avoidance of doubt, Lender shall be entitled to exercise its Conversion (as defined below) rights
until the Optional Prepayment Date. If Borrower exercises its right to prepay this Note, Borrower shall make payment to Lender of an amount
in cash equal to 105% multiplied by the then Outstanding Balance of this Note being repaid (the &ldquo;<B>Optional Prepayment Amount</B>&rdquo;).
In the event Borrower delivers the Optional Prepayment Amount to Lender prior to the Optional Prepayment Date, the Optional Prepayment
Amount shall not be deemed to have been paid to Lender until the Optional Prepayment Date. In the event Borrower delivers the Optional
Prepayment Amount without an Optional Prepayment Notice, then the Optional Prepayment Date will be deemed to be the date that is five
(5) Trading Days from the date that the Optional Prepayment Amount was delivered to Lender and Lender shall be entitled to exercise its
conversion rights set forth herein during such five (5) Trading Day period. In addition, if Borrower delivers an Optional Prepayment Notice
and fails to pay the Optional Prepayment Amount due to Lender within five (5) Trading Days following the Optional Prepayment Date, Borrower
shall forever forfeit its right to prepay this Note.</P>

by Lender to Borrower, interest shall accrue on the Outstanding Balance beginning on the date the applicable Event of Default occurred
at an interest rate equal to the lesser of fifteen percent (15%) per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law (&ldquo;<B>Default
Interest</B>&rdquo;). For the avoidance of doubt, Lender may continue making Conversions at any time following a Trigger Event or an Event
of Default until such time as the Note is paid in full. In connection with acceleration described herein, Lender need not provide, and
Borrower hereby waives, any presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, and Lender may immediately and without expiration
of any grace period enforce any and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and all other remedies available to it under applicable law.
Such acceleration may be rescinded and annulled by Lender at any time prior to payment hereunder and Lender shall have all rights as a
holder of the Note until such time, if any, that Lender receives full payment pursuant to this Section 4.4. No such rescission or annulment
shall affect any subsequent Trigger Event or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Nothing herein shall limit Lender&rsquo;s
right to pursue any other remedies available to it at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance
and/or injunctive relief with respect to Borrower&rsquo;s failure to timely deliver Conversion Shares upon Conversion of the Note as required

exchangeable for Class A Ordinary Shares to Lender or any third party (collectively, the &ldquo;<B>Equity Securities</B>&rdquo;), including
without limitation any Deemed Issuance, at an effective price per share less than the then effective Lender Conversion Price (such issuance

only reduced to equal such lower effective price per share, provided that the Lender Conversion Price shall in no event be less than the

provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options, or rights per share which are
issued in connection with such Dilutive Issuance, be entitled to receive Class A Ordinary Shares at an effective price per share that

under this section), and shall be made whenever such Equity Securities are issued. Borrower shall notify Lender, in writing, no later

price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price, or other pricing terms (such notice, the &ldquo;<B>Dilutive Issuance

upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, on the date of such Dilutive Issuance the Lender Conversion Price shall be lowered to equal
the applicable effective price per share regardless of whether Borrower or Lender accurately refers to such lower effective price per
share in any subsequent Installment Notice or Lender Conversion Notice.</P>

Lender shall have the right, exercisable at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, to redeem all or any portion of the Note (such
amount, the &ldquo;<B>Redemption Amount</B>&rdquo;), subject to the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount, by providing Borrower with a notice
substantially in the form attached hereto as <U>Exhibit B</U> (each, a &ldquo;<B>Redemption Notice</B>&rdquo;, and each date on which
Lender delivers a Redemption Notice, a &ldquo;<B>Redemption Date</B>&rdquo;). For the avoidance of doubt, Lender may submit to Borrower
one (1) or more Redemption Notices in any given calendar month; provided that the aggregate Redemption Amounts in such calendar month
do not exceed the Maximum Monthly Redemption Amount. Payments of each Redemption Amount may be made (a) in cash, or (b) by converting
such Redemption Amount into Class A Ordinary Shares (&ldquo;<B>Redemption Conversion Shares</B>&rdquo;, and together with the Lender Conversion
Shares, the &ldquo;<B>Conversion Shares</B>&rdquo;) in accordance with this Section 8.2 (each, a &ldquo;<B>Redemption Conversion</B>&rdquo;)
per the following formula: the number of Redemption Conversion Shares equals the portion of the applicable Redemption Amount being converted
divided by the Redemption Conversion Price, or (c) by any combination of the foregoing, so long as the cash is delivered to Lender on
the third (3<SUP>rd</SUP>) Trading Day immediately following the applicable Redemption Date and the Redemption Conversion Shares are delivered
to Lender on or before the applicable Delivery Date (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower will not be entitled to
elect a Redemption Conversion with respect to any portion of any applicable Redemption Amount and shall be required to pay the Redemption
Amount in cash, if on the applicable Redemption Date there is an Equity Conditions Failure, and such failure is not waived in writing
by Lender. Notwithstanding that failure to repay this Note in full by the Maturity Date is a Trigger Event, the Redemption Dates shall
continue after the Maturity Date pursuant to this&nbsp;Section 8.2 until the Outstanding Balance is repaid in full. At the end of each
month following the Redemption Start Date, if Borrower has not reduced the Outstanding Balance by at least the Maximum Monthly Redemption
Amount, then by the fifth (5<SUP>th</SUP>) day of the following month, Borrower must pay in cash the difference between the Maximum Monthly
Redemption Amount and the amount actually redeemed in such month or the Outstanding Balance will automatically increase by one percent
(1%). In the event Borrower is contractually restricted from issuing Redemption Conversion Shares to Lender, Borrower shall have the right
to defer all redemption payments that Lender could otherwise elect to make during any calendar month on three (3) separate occasions by
providing written notice to Lender at least three (3) Trading Days prior to the first day of each such calendar month for which it wishes
to defer redemptions for that month. In the event Borrower elects to exercise its deferral right, the Outstanding Balance shall automatically
be increased by one percent (1%) for each time Borrower exercises the deferral right.</P>

proposed allocation in the applicable Redemption Notice or elect to change the allocation by written notice to Lender by email or fax
within twenty-four (24) hours of its receipt of such Redemption Notice, so long as the sum of the cash payments and the amount of Redemption
Conversions equal the applicable Redemption Amount. If Borrower fails to notify Lender of its election to change the allocation prior
to the deadline set forth in the previous sentence, it shall be deemed to have ratified and accepted the allocation set forth in the applicable
Redemption Notice prepared by Lender. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the amounts and calculations set forth thereon are subject
to correction or adjustment because of error, mistake, or any adjustment resulting from a Trigger Event or other adjustment permitted
under the Transaction Documents (an &ldquo;<B>Adjustment</B>&rdquo;). Furthermore, no error or mistake in the preparation of such notices,

Notice or Redemption Notice), via reputable overnight courier, a certificate representing the number of Class A Ordinary Shares equal
to the number of Conversion Shares to which Lender shall be entitled, registered in the name of Lender or its designee. For the avoidance

Lender may at any time prior to receiving the applicable Conversion Shares rescind in whole or in part such Conversion, with a corresponding

Share Value) will be assessed for each day after the Delivery Date until Conversion Share delivery is made; and such late fees will be
added to the Outstanding Balance (such fees, the &ldquo;<B>Conversion Delay Late Fees</B>&rdquo;).</P>

decreased or waived by Lender as set forth below. By written notice to Borrower, Lender may increase, decrease or waive the Maximum Percentage
